monday suggested a modest expansion in factory activity as export orders bounced from a contraction yet economists noted the increase in new export orders point to possible front loading of u s bound shipments to avoid potential tariff hikes that u s president donald trump had threatened to slap on another 300 billion of chinese goods a run of chinese data recently including an official survey on the nation s manufacturing industry last week also showed rising pressure across the world s no 2 economy chinese companies probably see the current export conditions as severe as during the china shock in 2015 said wang shenshen economist at tokai tokyo research center indeed factory activity contracted in most asian countries last month as businesses came under pressure from the bitter trade war between washington and beijing sino u s tensions escalated during the weekend as the two countries clashed over trade technology and security a senior chinese official and trade negotiator said on sunday that the united states cannot use pressure to force a trade deal on china refusing to be drawn on whether the leaders of the two countries would meet at the g 20 summit to work out an agreement later this month china will investigate whether fedex corp damaged the legal rights and interests of its clients the official xinhua news agency said on saturday after chinese telecoms giant huawei

no longer tiptoe around chinese behavior in asia no one now thinks a deal would be possible at g 20 it is going to be a prolonged battle investors are rushing to the safe assets mitsubishi s fujito

does china have enough us dollars to survive the us trade war the chinese government is officially sitting on the world s largest stockpile of foreign exchange reserves but it has been scrambling recently to block backchannels for capital outflows as trade tensions with the united states increase beijing s increasing scrutiny of the usage of the us dollar by chinese companies and individuals in the absence of any immediate signs of a financial crisis along with accelerating efforts to lure in foreign capital have raised suspicions among analysts that the world s second largest economy is worried about the risk of running short of the us dollar on the surface china should be the last country in the world to worry about a shortage about two thirds of its us 3 1 trillion worth of foreign exchange reserves the world s largest are believed to be held in us dollar denominated assets but the huge foreign reserves and a relatively stable currency do no reflect the true stresses underlying the economy analysts said because the concerns are that those reserves may not be enough to provide the safety buffer needed to pay for china s imports and pay off its debt in adverse circumstances if the yuan faced a devaluation or a sharp drop in value analysts though doubt that china would be subject to an imminent balance of payment crisis similar to the one that argentina experienced last year the latin american country was hit by a currency crisis and stagflation because of structural deficiencies that constrained real demand and prevented the economy from growing sustainably if there was a sudden shock to the country china would not have enough us dollars to support its own currency said kevin lai chief economist for asia excluding japan at daiwa capital markets so that is why china needs to stop money outflows while creating inflows to support the yuan like money of other sovereign nations the yuan is backed by its foreign exchange reserves which are largely invested in us treasury securities the people s bank of china the country s central bank might need those assets not only to prop up the yuan by intervening in the foreign currency market but also to bail out the domestic banking system the risk is that if china s capital controls are ineffective the exodus of funds and a portion of china s reserves are not easily converted into cash then the central bank will soon have insufficient funds to maintain currency stability ever since us president donald trump started imposing tariffs on chinese imports in july last year there have been worries about a sharper than expected slowdown of china s economy which would accelerate capital outflows and reduce the supply of us dollars in the domestic financial system but policymakers worry that by digging further into its savings even just letting foreign reserves fall below the psychologically important us 3 trillion level could invite market speculation and set off a vicious cycle of sharp capital outflows and currency depreciation authorities have kept foreign reserves stable at around us 3 1 trillion since burning through almost us 1 trillion between mid 2014 and 2017 to defend the yuan china s reserves are now less than 30 per cent of its gross domestic product gdp down from 48 per cent in 2010 at the same time the country s external debt ballooned to an all time high of us 1 97 trillion last year this means its us 3 1 trillion in foreign reserves is about 1 6 times of its external debt and would be enough to cover 12 months of goods and services imports china s underlying vulnerability is especially opaque because the government is the ultimate holder of nearly all corporate debt state owned enterprises and other public entities enjoy implicit guarantees from the government and other forms of preferential treatment so even though corporate bond defaults hit a record high last year the ratio remains at a relatively low 1 per cent of outstanding bonds total chinese bond issuance rose to us 1 trillion in 2018 up from us 927 million in 2017 and us 774 million in 2015 according to data from dealogic at the same time corporate debt in china stood at 155 per cent of gdp in the second quarter of 2018 much higher than in other major economies and unlikely to be sustainable said the organisation for economic cooperation and development by comparison japan s corporate debt level is 100 per cent of gdp and that of the us is 74 per cent as the trade war with the us escalates the government is quietly tightening outbound money flows further although according to chinese law citizens are allowed to withdraw as much as us 50 000 a year former central bank adviser yu yongding said he was personally refused permission to transfer us 20 000 from his own personal account abroad according to yu the bank refused to provide the service because he is over 65 years old chinese banks are also scrutinising foreign currency withdrawals of us 3 000 or more in any single transaction down from us 5 000 previously an apparent reflection of the tighter supply of us dollars and their rising costs china s us dollar interest rate for one year deposits implied by the yuan exchange rate has risen steadily to around 3 4 per cent from 2 4 per cent last august according to thomson reuters data i always support capital account controls and i always encourage such measures but sometimes we tend to be too extreme in doing things yu was quoted as saying by chinese news portal sina com legal foreign exchange deals are being hindered in a statement replying a request by the post safe said it full guarantees true and legal foreign exchange uses by individuals and every chinese citizen in china is entitled to the right to buy up to us 50 000 worth of foreign

with the gdp growth rate slowing down and foreign debts piling up in 2018 19 managing the external sector in the next fiscal year will require real grit the national economic council nec has estimated the gdp growth rate for 2018 19 at 3 3 per cent way down from the revised growth rate of 5 2pc for 2017 18 this slowdown is largely because of the slackening in agricultural and industrial sectors it is one big reason for stagnant exports for 2019 20 the nec has set the overall gdp growth target of 4pc agriculture and industry are projected to grow 3 5pc and 2 2pc respectively but even if these two productive sectors grow at their projected rates boosting export earnings will not be a walk in the park ten month merchandise exports have remained stagnant at less than 19 2 billion full year exports look set to rise to 23bn pakistan s ability to meet external sector obligations without falling into a debt trap will be tested harshly in 2019 20 ten month merchandise imports have consumed about 45 5bn while full year imports may reach 54bn so we are heading towards a 32bn trade deficit in 2018 19 it cannot be expected to fall substantially in 2019 20 when a higher targeted economic growth rate will necessitate more imports historically higher gdp readings have not led to substantially high exports in pakistan ten month remittances were 17 9bn and full year inflows in 2018 19 may rise to 22bn even in the best case scenario combine export earnings and remittances and you still have a 9bn trade deficit to fill in from other sources can we expect this picture to change drastically in 2019 20 the global economy is showing signs of weaker growth the middle east is in deep political turmoil with iran and saudi arabia challenging each other and our internal political environment is getting overly charged how pakistan maintains a neutral position in the escalating us iran conflict in the persian gulf and the growing iran saudi arabia confrontation will have consequences for its economy boosting exports worldwide attracting more foreign investment from the united states and europe and ensuring the continuation of thicker flows of remittances from the west and the gulf region will require us to make tough policy choices and painful trade offs is that possible under our present political environment your guess is as good as mine the national cohesion and inclusiveness that is a must for dealing with such grim challenges seem missing though the energy cost already went up during this fiscal year it can be expected to remain even higher in the next year oil prices soar amid a growing conflict in the middle east the withdrawal of subsidies by the resource starved government can even mitigate the impact of the activation of a three year oil deferred payment facility of 3bn plus from saudi arabia effective from july 1 the central bank s policy rate is already 12 25pc up 6 25 percentage points from a year ago further monetary tightening is expected in 2019 20 to curb inflationary pressures arising out of higher oil prices and a weaker rupee despite some nominal gains in the interbank market in recent days the rupee is still vulnerable to further depreciation in the wake of persisting imbalances in the external account availability of just 8bn foreign exchange reserves with the central bank as of may 24 and the insistence by the international monetary fund imf to make the exchange rate freer from the central bank s interventions so the input cost of export oriented industries may remain high in the next fiscal year owing to higher energy prices weaker rupee and limited growth prospects the current fiscal year is set to see a reduced current account deficit in the first 10 months of the fiscal year it has already shrunk to 11 6bn from 15 6bn in the year ago period but in 2019 20 managing even a reduced deficit can be difficult with the external debt servicing growing and the need for augmenting foreign exchange reserves becoming more pressing owing to the challenges to peace and stability in the middle east the government says the final approval of a 6bn imf loan sometime this month should enable us to borrow from the world bank asian development bank and other multilateral lending agencies the imf loan should also help us launch sovereign bonds and attract even larger foreign direct investment but these assumptions don t take into account the unfolding geopolitical developments and growing tensions in domestic politics taking a toll on the performance of the federal and provincial governments since the imf loan will be available in 13 quarterly payments subject to regular reviews by the lender islamabad s position in regional affairs will inevitably affect its quarterly performance and that will give the imf reason to approve or delay the next quarterly tranche whether we can borrow from other multilateral lending agencies will also be subject to how these institutions view our economic strengths and weaknesses and to some extent our position in the geopolitical landscape no amount of foreign exchange will come in automatically and as fast as our own requirements dictate in 2019 20 pakistan s ability to meet external sector obligations without falling into a debt trap will be tested harshly in 2018 19 we got about 9bn from saudi arabia china and the united arab emirates just to continue to foot the import bill and make external debt payments in 2019 20 our reliance on the imf and these friendly countries will be for the same purpose so the real issue is that we have accumulated too much external debt and have conveniently ignored for years a huge build up in the import bill in 2018 19 external debt servicing is set to consume 9bn it has already eaten up 7 23bn in the first nine months of the year the amount can grow in 2019 20 as total external debt and liabilities swelled to 105 84bn in march from 92 29bn a year ago external sector issues are really grave and they need sober and adroit handling let s hope for the better published in dawn the business and finance weekly june 3rd 2019
dollar opened the week mildly lower but appears to have found some footing in early european session trump is fighting trade wars on two fronts at least on the one hand china has cleared stated its position for not backing down on some core issues with a white paper released on sunday so there is little chance for a breakthrough in us china trade negotiation for the near term and it s even doubtful on whether trump and xi will meet at the g20 summit in japan later in the month on the other hand mexican officials will be in washington this week comments so far suggested that mexico is open to work with the us on measures to curb immigration flow through the country to us however the main problem is that trump will only drop the tariffs threats if mexico could meet his demands which are so far quite arbitrary and as trump tweeted mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the border problem is they ve been talking for 25 years we want action not talk so it s unsure how mexico s good faith would be responded to in the currency markets at the time of writing yen is the weakest one for today followed by sterling swiss franc is the strongest one followed by australian

highly anticipated white paper released on sunday on trade relationship with us was quite anti climatic the overall paper and the press conference were basically old wine in old bottles but the message was clear that china is preparing itself for prolonged trade war with us in short china blamed the us for starting trade conflicts and it criticized the us for going back on what s agreed three times and it hold us totally responsible for the collapse of trade negotiation china also reiterated pre conditions on resuming trade negotiations first both sides have to respect each other s social system economic system development path and rights secondly the negotiations has to be based on integrity thirdly china will not step back on its principles including sovereignty the implications are quite clear that china will not do anything to change its own development path along socialist market economy or some would call that state capitalism that is china will not retreat from subsidizing state owned enterprises secondly the implementation of the agreement should be under full control of the sovereign entity that is for example china will decide what new laws to pass to curb ip theft or it will fulfil the commitment with administrative measures china will object to us instructions on what are to be done exactly china caixin pmi manufacturing unchanged at 50 2 some

being subjected to any european union disciplinary procedure over public debt over the weekend economy minister giovanni tria blamed the economic downturn for rising debt however he also emphasized italy does not want to clash with the european commission and i hope the opposite is also true that is to say that no one in brussels intends to engage in a fight with us he reiterated the pledge to keep budget deficit below government forecast of 2 4 of gdp and he added our position is reasonable and i think we will eventually reach a compromise with the commission european commissioner for economic and financial affairs pierre moscovici said on sunday that he d still prefer dialogue with to sanctions on italy regarding it s budget and for the past five years i have not punished anyone however he emphasized if they do not respect the rules at all it will be necessary for the european commission and the european states to take their responsibilities the commission will make proposals

fifth successive months weak demand from japan s key trade partner china as well as signs of an increasingly sluggish domestic economy have impacted sales volumes given the importance of capital goods

with the gdp growth rate slowing down and foreign debts piling up in 2018 19 managing the external sector in the next fiscal year will require real grit the national economic council nec has estimated the gdp growth rate for 2018 19 at 3 3 per cent way down from the revised growth rate of 5 2pc for 2017 18 this slowdown is largely because of the slackening in agricultural and industrial sectors it is one big reason for stagnant exports for 2019 20 the nec has set the overall gdp growth target of 4pc agriculture and industry are projected to grow 3 5pc and 2 2pc respectively but even if these two productive sectors grow at their projected rates boosting export earnings will not be a walk in the park ten month merchandise exports have remained stagnant at less than 19 2 billion full year exports look set to rise to 23bn pakistan s ability to meet external sector obligations without falling into a debt trap will be tested harshly in 2019 20 ten month merchandise imports have consumed about 45 5bn while full year imports may reach 54bn so we are heading towards a 32bn trade deficit in 2018 19 it cannot be expected to fall substantially in 2019 20 when a higher targeted economic growth rate will necessitate more imports historically higher gdp readings have not led to substantially high exports in pakistan ten month remittances were 17 9bn and full year inflows in 2018 19 may rise to 22bn even in the best case scenario combine export earnings and remittances and you still have a 9bn trade deficit to fill in from other sources can we expect this picture to change drastically in 2019 20 the global economy is showing signs of weaker growth the middle east is in deep political turmoil with iran and saudi arabia challenging each other and our internal political environment is getting overly charged how pakistan maintains a neutral position in the escalating us iran conflict in the persian gulf and the growing iran saudi arabia confrontation will have consequences for its economy boosting exports worldwide attracting more foreign investment from the united states and europe and ensuring the continuation of thicker flows of remittances from the west and the gulf region will require us to make tough policy choices and painful trade offs is that possible under our present political environment your guess is as good as mine the national cohesion and inclusiveness that is a must for dealing with such grim challenges seem missing though the energy cost already went up during this fiscal year it can be expected to remain even higher in the next year oil prices soar amid a growing conflict in the middle east the withdrawal of subsidies by the resource starved government can even mitigate the impact of the activation of a three year oil deferred payment facility of 3bn plus from saudi arabia effective from july 1 the central bank s policy rate is already 12 25pc up 6 25 percentage points from a year ago further monetary tightening is expected in 2019 20 to curb inflationary pressures arising out of higher oil prices and a weaker rupee despite some nominal gains in the interbank market in recent days the rupee is still vulnerable to further depreciation in the wake of persisting imbalances in the external account availability of just 8bn foreign exchange reserves with the central bank as of may 24 and the insistence by the international monetary fund imf to make the exchange rate freer from the central bank s interventions so the input cost of export oriented industries may remain high in the next fiscal year owing to higher energy prices weaker rupee and limited growth prospects the current fiscal year is set to see a reduced current account deficit in the first 10 months of the fiscal year it has already shrunk to 11 6bn from 15 6bn in the year ago period but in 2019 20 managing even a reduced deficit can be difficult with the external debt servicing growing and the need for augmenting foreign exchange reserves becoming more pressing owing to the challenges to peace and stability in the middle east the government says the final approval of a 6bn imf loan sometime this month should enable us to borrow from the world bank asian development bank and other multilateral lending agencies the imf loan should also help us launch sovereign bonds and attract even larger foreign direct investment but these assumptions don t take into account the unfolding geopolitical developments and growing tensions in domestic politics taking a toll on the performance of the federal and provincial governments since the imf loan will be available in 13 quarterly payments subject to regular reviews by the lender islamabad s position in regional affairs will inevitably affect its quarterly performance and that will give the imf reason to approve or delay the next quarterly tranche whether we can borrow from other multilateral lending agencies will also be subject to how these institutions view our economic strengths and weaknesses and to some extent our position in the geopolitical landscape no amount of foreign exchange will come in automatically and as fast as our own requirements dictate in 2019 20 pakistan s ability to meet external sector obligations without falling into a debt trap will be tested harshly in 2018 19 we got about 9bn from saudi arabia china and the united arab emirates just to continue to foot the import bill and make external debt payments in 2019 20 our reliance on the imf and these friendly countries will be for the same purpose so the real issue is that we have accumulated too much external debt and have conveniently ignored for years a huge build up in the import bill in 2018 19 external debt servicing is set to consume 9bn it has already eaten up 7 23bn in the first nine months of the year the amount can grow in 2019 20 as total external debt and liabilities swelled to 105 84bn in march from 92 29bn a year ago external sector issues are really grave and they need sober and adroit handling let s hope for the better published in dawn the business and finance weekly june 3rd 2019
market update the swiss franc and japanese yen exchange rates continued to extend gains against a basket of major peers into tuesday s session with further developments on the trade front continuing to weigh on risk appetite the notable exception was the single currency which despite relatively closer ties to china gained against majors in early trade meanwhile the us dollar lost some of its safe haven shine with investors expecting a larger than previously anticipated negative impact on the us economy from the now multi fronted trade war elevated expectations for a fed rate cut were spurred higher by comments from fomc member bullard who suggested lower interest rates could be warranted casting doubt on whether negotiations between the us and mexico will be enough to stave off imminent tariff hikes mexico said on monday it would reject a us demand which called for the nation to be designated a safe third country and take in all central american asylum seekers a term aimed at curbing migration across mexico northern border into the us speaking to reporters mexican foreign minister marcelo ebrard said an agreement about a safe third country would not be acceptable for mexico hey have not yet proposed it to me but it would not be acceptable and they know it the blame game continued between us and china keeping hopes of a resolution suppressed and maintaining the risk off market undertone it is important to note that the impetus for the discussions was china s long history of unfair trade practices the treasury department and the u s trade representative said in a joint statement adding our negotiating positions have been consistent throughout these talks and china back pedaled on important elements of what the parties had agreed to for now we expect safe haven assets to remain bid as the outlook continues to deteriorate the general risk averse market undertone continued this week in the wake of trump s fresh trade grenade this time lobbed at mexico coupled with increasingly hawkish rhetoric from both sides in the us china trade spat suggesting no end to the dispute in the near term under these conditions the swiss franc and japanese yen have continued to shine with their safe haven status prompting massive inflows as investors seek the relative safety to weather what storms may come as the skies darken advertisement while the swiss franc has appreciated strongly in recent weeks much of that gains is due to the wave of risk aversion sweeping across markets and we need to see further substantial gains before the central bank has to step in wrote currency strategist manuel oliveri of credit agricole in a note to clients versus the yen the euro managed to tread water with the eur to jpy exchange rate last seen at 121 044 meanwhile reacting sharply to last week s escalation of trade tensions brent bcousd sold off sharply exacerbating an already apparent slide which has seen the price of oil tumble by over 13 over the last two weeks dragging the oil coupled canadian dollar with it with the prospects for global trade continuing to deteriorate a number of economists have highlighted the growing risks to us and global economic health with the inversion of the us treasury yield curve back on the agenda once more according to analysts at morgan stanley a global recession could commence before the first quarter of 2020 is through should us and chinese trade relations not improve a fact which markets appear to be discounting for now according to some analysts recent conversations with investors have reinforced the sense that markets are underestimating the impact of trade tensions wrote chief morgan stanley economist chetan ahya adding investors are generally of the view that the trade dispute could drag on for longer but they appear to be overlooking its potential impact on the global macro outlook elsewhere jpmorgan chase co upped their estimates for a us recession with the multinational investment bank warning of a 40 probability of the us entering a recession in h2 2019 a stark upward revision from their previously held 25 probability highlighting the drag of lower export demand vie global trade concerns and lending credence to the anticipated global slowdown monday saw korean export figures a bellwether of global health continue to slide for a fifth successive month foreboding even lower demand ahead the baltic dry freight index perceived as a leading indicator for raw material demand is also on the year with a slew of pmis due globally this week releases could be crucial in reinforcing or rejecting the perceived slide towards recession joining the growing clamour from wall street while not quite as depressed about the outlook as others goldman sachs trimmed their forecast for h2 us economic growth to 2 ahead of expected tariff hikes of 10 on all remaining chinese goods as well as mexican imports while markets had been hoping us and chinese leaders would abandon the aggressive rhetoric for the sake of the global economy developments thus far have pointed towards further escalation rather than abatement when you are the piggy bank nation that foreign countries have been robbing and deceiving for years the word tariff is a beautiful word indeed others must treat the united states fairly and with respect we are no longer the fools of the past donald j trump realdonaldtrump 1 june 2019 in line with the growing consensus of a reciprocated negative economic influence from escalating trade analysts at citigroup advised clients to buy us treasuries while noting market precedent from late 2016 with similar global economic conditions then foreshadowing a moderate global slowdown that episode may provide a useful blueprint for the coming months wrote citigroup s director of macro strategy mark schofield adding the u s economy has been resilient up to now however persistent themes of softening tailwinds in the form of declining fiscal stimulus and strengthening headwinds in the form of trade tensions and china slowdown are a threat despite some similarities there are also a number of disparities which appear to dent the recession boding outlook and bring into question the efficacy of the curve inversion as a leading recession indicator for one the last two major recessions in the us have been preceded by a marked slowdown in hiring promoting a stark rise in unemployment rates looking at the us labour market s current footing this appears to be almost as far from the case it s possible to be with the unemployment rate in the us currently residing close to a 50 year low furthermore equities have continued to perform relatively well over the year thus far with may representing the first month in the red for global and us shares a far cry from the 12 months on declines which were antecedent to the last two us recessions moving forward therefore the outlook remains distinctly uncertain whether or not escalating trade wars push the us and global economies into recession remains to be seen however we can be sure than the risks to global growth are clear and present and with the us expected to extend their already multi fronted trade war to include japan and europe and potentially any other nations running a trade deficit amid nil signs of progress towards resolving the issues conditions could definitely deteriorate further pmi releases this week will be of key note ahead of next week s g20 summit with particular focus on a trump xi tet a tet for now the risk off undertone is likely to continue to support safe haven currencies such as the yen and swiss franc while commodity linked currencies such as the australian dollar will likely remain subdued especially ahead of the rba the canadian dollar is also likely to remain under the weather amid the current oil sell off
how many traders does it take to send the dow jones industrial average djia plunging 650 points none just a tweet from donald trump is good enough welcome to the new normal earlier only central bankers moved markets now politicians do too and presumably the worst or maybe the best is yet to come cohesive not to mention excessive expansionary measures by central banks have kept markets buoyant globally much of what is happening does not make sense any more as investors are willing to pay more and more for the same level of growth see more for less sarah ketterer co founder causeway capital which has 53 billion under management is confounded by the 15 annual return that the msci usa index has delivered over the past decade that return occurred with historically low levels of 10 year volatility abnormally high return should come with abnormally high risks and the fact that the inverse has occurred is an outcome of very strange monetary policy she says in the latter half of 2018 investors were concerned that the federal reserve was going to keep on raising rates and drive the us economy into a recession with the fed changing stance back to neutral that worry is off the table investors are also not worried about lower expected earnings growth as they feel stable interest rates will eventually revive the momentum the biggest risk is that investors don t believe they are taking risks we have hit an all time low for us market volatility on a rolling ten year basis even institutional clients are not cognizant of that everyone has this kind of five year window of memory adds ketterer another significant change that has happened is now the earnings outlook of technology companies spooks the market more than that of manufacturing companies in the us stock market manufacturing in aggregate is just not that big a piece and so investors hardly bat an eyelid when in its q12019 earnings call 3m says the rest of 2019 is going to be challenging now the top five market cap companies are all tech and that is where most of the investor attention is focused so much so that amazon has also entered berkshire hathaway s investment portfolio along with apple which is now the biggest holding hence even if earnings are weak on the manufacturing side it gets counterbalanced by good earnings from facebook microsoft and amazon ben inker head of asset allocation at gmo which has 66 billion under management is not so sanguine we are somewhat nervous because corporate profits are extraordinarily high in the us historically from these levels they have always come down you ve got two possibilities either profits somehow stay at these extraordinarily high levels and the market is merely expensive or profit margins come down and the market is kind of disastrously expensive most asset classes around the world are expensive relative to their own history even us cash and bond rates are very low relative to their historical rates the us stock market has been the strongest performing since the financial crisis and shows no sign of letting up since the december low the s p is up about 22 while the nasdaq and the djia have climbed more than 27 and 19 respectively inker mentions we really don t own any material amount of us stocks anymore we ve got about a quarter of the overall portfolio in em equities and another 15 in non us developed market equities sky high valuation it is not just the folks at gmo who are complaining about the lack of bargains the oracle of omaha too is struggling with a problem of plenty at berkshire hathaway in his latest shareholder letter he wrote in the years ahead we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that berkshire will permanently own the immediate prospects for that however are not good prices are sky high for businesses possessing decent long term prospects so warren buffett is making do by buying back his own stock in the latest quarter he spent 1 7 billion doing just that in the us the bond market a default safe haven has rallied alongside the stock market last december when the market dived after the talk of president trump meddling with the fed the us 10 year yield fell from 3 26 to 2 34 now it yields 2 46 and the s p 500 is just backing off from its all time high after trump s latest tariff salvo against china so what gives one explanation is that the market is now anticipating the fed s next move to be down the other being that the us yield is relatively more attractive than what is available in europe and investors are comfortable with us economic growth that could also in part explain the strength of the dollar against the euro for the past six months the euro dollar has been trading in the 1 12 1 15 range it is only now that it has broken below 1 12 michael kass portfolio manager at baron capital which has 30 billion under management says not much should be read into the recent dollar rally traditionally a dollar rally has been negative for emerging markets for most parts the dollar has not been particularly strong against emerging market currencies when dollar strength is not being confirmed in emerging markets that means the risk environment is much more favourable than it was last year the variant view with bond yields rallying could be that investors are now hedging their bets by not plunging headlong into equities the broad based s p 500 may have just about hit an all time high post december but the djia or the russell 2000 did not register a new high something similar is happening in the indian market where the mid cap and small cap indices have not rallied as much as the benchmark nifty index over the past year even within the nifty itself there is great performance divergence and according to credit suisse india estimates it currently trades at one year forward p e of 18 2x against the 10 year average of 15 4x while fixed income investors in europe may be flocking to the us 10 year ketterer believes europe is a better hunting ground for equities relative to the benchmark where the us makes up over 60 of the weight we re underweight but europe is just deeply undervalued a lot of these european stocks are multinationals and may be a quarter of their revenue comes from the us anyway so it s very difficult to talk about isolating regions when there s so much overlap she specifies gmo s inker though likes the emerging markets basket see final frontier as he feels it is hard to get decent real return out of the us stock market because it is expensive and on the bond side real yields are close to zero it s hard to see how anything non heroic is going to get you the 5 to 6 real return that everybody s kind of assuming for their long term portfolio we like emerging markets better than the us and developed international if you look at the valuations on a cyclically adjusted p e it s trading around 14x against 27x for the us and 21x for eafe so it s significantly cheaper he elaborates india for now is an exception for being an expensive market inker says india is the most expensive market in our universe by a wide margin even adjusting for the higher level of quality we see at the company level the valuations appear stretched and the growth projections appear unrealistic for the past few years valuations have gotten more expensive while profitability and margins have languished he also feels that the indian market has run ahead of itself the market has aggressively priced in the future benefits of the modi reform agenda while we believe most of the past reforms will be net positive in the long run the market has overshot in our opinion we are also concerned about modi s ability to conduct and complete future reforms given departures from his staff and his possible loss of majority in the government he adds another emerging market that has frequently been hogging the headlines is argentina even as argentinean bond yields are rising most global investors think it is a contained problem as there aren t many other countries that require help with their external debt and hence rule out any contagion in emerging markets inker opines i think the problems in argentina have every reason to stay in argentina my biggest fear for emerging markets would be if there was a bad loan crisis in china it s an opaque enough system and that could cause significant contagion even though there is fast nominal gdp growth and the chinese central government doesn t have that much debt itself and has the potential to bail out the system if it gets into trouble it worries me investors have long been wary of the credit growth in china where much of the lending has been government directed the inattentive lending has led to sporadic crisis but not big enough to spark emerging market contagion another emerging market hotspot that investors worry about is turkey for its linkages with europe s banking system ketterer says turkey worries us because of the not so close relationship with its neighbours and its proximity to europe and the relationship with european banks it is a bigger economy and more impactful so we re watching the situation because staying within budget and correcting a massive current account deficit would be good for turkey and yet you know they are not necessarily run by somebody who is economically minded at present seeking inflation most economies not to mention financial assets have been beneficiaries of low rates now the most obvious trigger that would cause interest rates to go up is inflation the biggest economic mystery over the past decade or so is that the developed world has been resistant to inflation despite strong global growth sporadic commodity boom and the fed s pre occupation with its 2 inflation target inflation has been largely evasive an exasperated buffett recently remarked no economics textbook i know that was written in the first couple of thousand years discussed even the possibility that you could have this sort of situation continue and have all variables stay more or less the same inker says what has been going on has been driven by a couple of important temporary factors the first being the rise of china as a manufacturing centre after joining the wto its share of global exports has exploded as it was a cheaper place to build stuff that has been strongly disinflationary the second factor is the relationship between unemployment and wage growth has been much weaker than it used to be one reason could be the globalisation of labour markets where technology has made it easy to offshore jobs inker thinks china s golden run as a cheap manufacturing destination is about to end as unit labour costs are rising pretty fast he also adds that for stuff that isn t built in china yet there may be a good reason why it s not built there so their ability to absorb evermore share of manufactured goods may be ending he though is not as sure if the globalisation of labour markets is over jobs moving overseas be it in manufacturing or services has been a bone of contention for president trump right now the us labour market is pretty buoyant and hence service jobs moving overseas might not have been paid heed to not only is us unemployment very low there has been very minor acceleration in wage growth if one indeed assumes a global workforce then wage inflation could take a long time to show up unless of course induced by intent a very real possibility which we will come to a little later markets are priced as if the potential of inflation is non existent and i think that s dangerous we could get material wage growth and the fed would quickly realise the neutral rate is higher and it would have to go above neutral to try and control it cautions inker incumbent resistance going by the latest knee jerk reaction to trump s tweet the united states has been losing for many years 600 to 800 billion dollars a year on trade with china we lose 500 billion dollars sorry we re not going to be doing that anymore were investors taking it a little too easy the prospect of a trade war between the us and china did rattle markets in 2018 since trade wars reduce economic activity and increase inflation that worry had largely dissipated as investors believed there will be a deal as it is in nobody s interest to protract the conflict kass says it will be tough for trump to continue with his aggressive protectionist stance you can either have major margin disruption and an earnings recession in the us or you have inflation and then both would affect the us capital markets the collateral damage is too big to actually follow through with the highest level of threatened action the us has largely been threatening tariffs on manufactured goods which is unquestionably inflationary such a move does impact the manufacturing sector but not necessarily labour markets there is no tariff on your call center in the philippines or your it support in india or any other large work that s getting shuttled around the world well that is theory for all rationality goes out of the window if politicians want to get re elected good politics does not necessarily translate into good economics trump s re election in november 2020 hinges on the market staying buoyant so far everything has gone right for him economically and he would want the feel good to continue hence he would do everything in his power to not let the fed raise rates as that is the only bogeyman that could derail the djia s gravy train there will certainly be posturing of some kind in the run up to the us elections given the head on stance that trump likes to adopt but inker doesn t seem to be fretting over it much one of the things that the market has taken from the various tweets and other statements from trump is you don t necessarily want to pay too much attention to what he says until he actually does something i don t know whether harsh words on the campaign trail would translate into action because much of the posturing hasn t really been followed up with policy he says populist clamour besides the clear and present hollering of politicians there are other risks which investors would be better off paying heed to having sent price discovery for a toss monetary policy is in uncharted territory kass says while the central banks in europe and japan may not have ceased quantitative easing qe that monetary gasoline itself is about to hit a dead end the ecb balance sheet already owns just about all they can own of their specific kind of mandates as to credit quality how far out on the risk spectrum percentage of total bonds in existence of any country they are reaching those limits he points out as for japan the central bank has truly adopted qe infinity the situation is getting a little bizarre as the central bank s bond and equity holdings now exceed nominal gdp you are looking at negative interest rates in japan and a very large portion of outstanding debt in europe and japan is another signal that they are reaching the physical limits of qe and monetary policy adds kass the fed is not quite in that position but not that far either after shrinking its balance sheet by about half a trillion in fact if president trump had his way he would have the fed lower rates as of yesterday his assertion that the fed cut rates by 100 basis points flies in the face of a strong jobs market his insistence of course conveniently ignores that during his presidential campaign he lambasted the fed for keeping rates artificially low and questioned its independence in september 2016 he had said janet yellen should be ashamed of what she s doing to the country by keeping interest rates low the fed has created a false stock market i used to hope that the fed was independent and the fed is obviously not independent it s obviously not even close to being independent indian investors might have just experienced a sense of déjà vu ironically if one goes by how the us 10 year has behaved since december investors are discounting a rate cut by the fed question is will it come through of course that is what trump wants that self serving bias is fine so long as it does not become endemic ketterer says what makes this election all the more fascinating is that it is hard to know which populist would be the loudest anything unexpected politically is a risk for the market but europe looks more fragile to us in terms of populism than the us his rabid outpouring aside the democrats have really no economic plank to dislodge trump so they are highlighting social inequity and how those with assets have unequally benefitted from the economic expansion over the past decade among the left leaning candidates of the democratic party there is a lot of talk around modern monetary theory mmt where fiscal spending gets priority over monetary policy kass says ems are moving in the right direction with respect to political emphasis and policies while the opposite is true for large buckets of the developed world particularly uk pockets of europe and the us there the entire political discourse is about how to be balanced how to redistribute wealth and resources away from capital owners and corporations and return some portion of that to labour and the lower class that represents a threat to corporate profit margins down the road and to asset values he says while increased fiscal spending in the us does raise the specter of a weak dollar emerging markets might just end up as unintended beneficiaries visible hand unless it gets out of hand the resulting higher inflation from fiscal spending could make monetary policy effective again it is hard to lower rates when nominal rates are close to zero and by raising inflation the fed could gain greater control over real interest rates ketterer ponders i don t think societies can persist very long without some sort of backlash and you see this in europe with this strength in recent years of populist politicians promising wage earners with benefits because they feel extremely disenfranchised so what may undermine this ebullience in the market might not necessarily come from an economic change as much as a sociopolitical one it is the nature of markets to be manic depressive but now even political leaders are turning out to be unpredictable inker points to brazil which was priced for disaster a couple of years ago they haven t exactly fixed many of their structural problems but right now investors are giving them the benefit of the doubt one of the things about charismatic leaders is they tend to be better at promising than delivering but they often say things that investors like to hear this time around though they might just end up saying things that investors do not want to hear

this article is excerpted from ellen brown s new book banking on the people democratizing money in the digital age available in paperback the u s federal debt has more than doubled since the 2008 financial crisis shooting up from 9 4 trillion in mid 2008 to over 22 trillion in april 2019 the debt is never paid off the government just keeps paying the interest on it and interest rates are rising in 2018 the fed announced plans to raise rates by 2020 to normal levels a fed funds target of 3 375 percent and to sell about 1 5 trillion in federal securities at the rate of 50 billion monthly further growing the mountain of federal debt on the market when the fed holds government securities it returns the interest to the government after deducting its costs but the private buyers of these securities will be pocketing the interest adding to the taxpayers bill in fact it is the interest not the debt itself that is the problem with a burgeoning federal debt the principal just gets rolled over from year to year but the interest must be paid to private bondholders annually by the taxpayers and constitutes one of the biggest items in the federal budget currently the fed s plans for quantitative tightening are on hold but assuming it follows through with them projections are that by 2027 u s taxpayers will owe 1 trillion annually just in interest on the federal debt that is enough to fund president donald trump s trillion dollar infrastructure plan every year and it is a direct transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy investors holding most of the bonds where will this money come from crippling taxes wholesale privatization of public assets and elimination of social services will not be sufficient to cover the bill bondholder debt is unnecessary the irony is that the united states does not need to carry a debt to bondholders at all it has been financially sovereign ever since president franklin d roosevelt took the dollar off the gold standard domestically in 1933 this was recognized by beardsley ruml chairman of the federal reserve bank of new york in a 1945 presentation before the american bar association titled taxes for revenue are obsolete the necessity for government to tax in order to maintain both its independence and its solvency is true for state and local governments he said but it is not true for a national government the government was now at liberty to spend as needed to meet its budget drawing on credit issued by its own central bank it could do this until price inflation indicated a weakened purchasing power of the currency then and only then would the government need to levy taxes not to fund the budget but to counteract inflation by contracting the money supply the principal purpose of taxes said ruml was the maintenance of a dollar which has stable purchasing power over the years sometimes this purpose is stated as the avoidance of inflation the government could be funded without taxes by drawing on credit from its own central bank and since there was no longer a need for gold to cover the loan the central bank would not have to borrow it could just create the money on its books this insight is a basic tenet of modern monetary theory the government does not need to borrow or tax at least until prices are driven up it can just create the money it needs the government could create money by issuing it directly or by borrowing it directly from the central bank which would create the money on its books or by taking a perpetual overdraft on the treasury s account at the central bank which would have the same effect the power revolution transferring the money power to the banks the treasury could do that in theory but some laws would need to be changed currently the federal government is not allowed to borrow directly from the fed and is required to have the money in its account before spending it after the dollar went off the gold standard in 1933 congress could have had the fed just print money and lend it to the government cutting the banks out but wall street lobbied for an amendment to the federal reserve act forbidding the fed to buy bonds directly from the treasury as it had done in the past the treasury can borrow from itself by transferring money from intragovernmental accounts social security and other trust funds that are under the auspices of the treasury and have a surplus but these funds do not include the federal reserve which can lend to the government only by buying federal securities from bond dealers the fed is considered independent of the government its website states the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities are categorized as held by the public because they are not in government accounts according to marriner eccles chairman of the federal reserve from 1934 to 1948 the prohibition against allowing the government to borrow directly from its own central bank was written into the banking act of 1935 at the behest of those bond dealers that have an exclusive right to purchase directly from the fed a historical review on the website of the new york federal reserve quotes eccles as stating i think the real reasons for writing the prohibition into the can be traced to certain government bond dealers who quite naturally had their eyes on business that might be lost to them if direct purchasing were permitted the government was required to sell bonds through wall street middlemen which the fed could buy only through open market operations purchases on the private bond market open market operations are conducted by the federal open market committee fomc which meets behind closed doors and is dominated by private banker interests the fomc has no obligation to buy the government s debt and generally does so only when it serves the purposes of the fed and the banks rep wright patman chairman of the house committee on banking and currency from 1963 to 1975 called the official sanctioning of the federal open market committee in the banking laws of 1933 and 1935 the power revolution the transfer of the money power to the banks patman said the open market is in reality a tightly closed market only a selected few bond dealers were entitled to bid on the bonds the treasury made available for auction each week the practical effect he said was to take money from the taxpayer and give it to these dealers feeding off the real economy that massive wall street subsidy was the subject of testimony by eccles to the house committee on banking and currency on march 3 5 1947 patman asked eccles now since 1935 in order for the federal reserve banks to buy government bonds they had to go through a middleman is that correct eccles replied in the affirmative patman then launched into a prophetic warning stating i am opposed to the united states government which possesses the sovereign and exclusive privilege of creating money paying private bankers for the use of its own money i insist it is absolutely wrong for this committee to permit this condition to continue and saddle the taxpayers of this nation with a burden of debt that they will not be able to liquidate in a hundred years or two hundred years the truth of that statement is painfully evident today when we have a 22 trillion debt that cannot possibly be repaid the government just keeps rolling it over and paying the interest to banks and bondholders feeding the financialized economy in which money makes money without producing new goods and services the financialized economy has become a parasite feeding off the real economy driving producers and workers further and further into debt in the 1960s patman attempted to have the fed nationalized the effort failed but his committee did succeed in forcing the central bank to return its profits to the treasury after deducting its costs the prohibition against direct lending by the central bank to the government however remains in force the money power is still with the fomc and the banks a model we can no longer afford today the debt growth model has reached its limits as even the bank for international settlements the central bankers bank in switzerland acknowledges in its june 2016 annual report the bis said that debt levels were too high productivity growth was too low and the room for policy maneuver was too narrow the global economy cannot afford to rely any longer on the debt fueled growth model that has brought it to the current juncture the bis warned but the solutions it proposed would continue the austerity policies long imposed on countries that cannot pay their debts it prescribed prudential fiscal and above all structural policies structural readjustment that means privatizing public assets slashing services and raising taxes choking off the very productivity needed to pay the nations debts that approach has repeatedly been tried and has failed as witnessed for example in the devastated economy of greece meanwhile according to minneapolis fed president neel kashkari financial regulation since 2008 has reduced the chances of another government bailout only modestly from 84 percent to 67 percent that means there is still a 67 percent chance of another major systemwide crisis and this one could be worse than the last the biggest banks are bigger local banks are fewer and global debt levels are higher the economy has farther to fall the regulators models are obsolete aimed at a form of old fashioned banking that has long since been abandoned we need a new model one designed to serve the needs of the public and the economy rather than to maximize shareholder profits at public expense _____________________ an earlier version of this article was published in truthout org ellen brown is

could create money by issuing it directly or by borrowing it directly from the central bank which would create the money on its books or by taking a perpetual overdraft on the treasury s account at the central bank which would have the same effect the power revolution transferring the money power to the banks the treasury could do that in theory but some laws would need to be changed currently the federal government is not allowed to borrow directly from the fed and is required to have the money in its account before spending it after the dollar went off the gold standard in 1933 congress could have had the fed just print money and lend it to the government cutting the banks out but wall street lobbied for an amendment to the federal reserve act forbidding the fed to buy bonds directly from the treasury as it had done in the past the treasury can borrow from itself by transferring money from intragovernmental accounts social security and other trust funds that are under the auspices of the treasury and have a surplus but these funds do not include the federal reserve which can lend to the government only by buying federal securities from bond dealers the fed is considered independent of the government its website states the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities are categorized as held by the public because they are not in government accounts according to marriner eccles chairman of the federal reserve from 1934 to 1948 the prohibition against allowing the government to borrow directly from its own central bank was written into the banking act of 1935 at the behest of those bond dealers that have an exclusive right to purchase directly from the fed a historical review on the website of the new york federal reserve quotes eccles as stating i think the real reasons for writing the prohibition into the can be traced to certain government bond dealers who quite naturally had their eyes on business that might be lost to them if direct purchasing were permitted the government was required to sell bonds through wall street middlemen which the fed could buy only through open market operations purchases on the private bond market open market operations are conducted by the federal open market committee fomc which meets behind closed doors and is dominated by private banker interests the fomc has no obligation to buy the government s debt and generally does so only when it serves the purposes of the fed and the banks rep wright patman chairman of the house committee on banking and currency from 1963 to 1975 called the official sanctioning of the federal open market committee in the banking laws of 1933 and 1935 the power revolution the transfer of the money power to the banks patman said the open market is in reality a tightly closed market only a selected few bond dealers were entitled to bid on the bonds the treasury made available for auction each week the practical effect he said was to take money from the taxpayer and give it to these dealers feeding off the real economy that massive wall street subsidy was the subject of testimony by eccles to the house committee on banking and currency on march 3 5 1947 patman asked eccles now since 1935 in order for the federal reserve banks to buy government bonds they had to go through a middleman is that correct eccles replied in the affirmative patman then launched into a prophetic warning stating i am opposed to the united states government which possesses the sovereign and exclusive privilege of creating money paying private bankers for the use of its own money i insist it is absolutely wrong for this committee to permit this condition to continue and saddle the taxpayers of this nation with a burden of debt that they will not be able to liquidate in a hundred years or two hundred years the truth of that statement is painfully evident today when we have a 22 trillion debt that cannot possibly be repaid the government just keeps rolling it over and paying the interest to banks and bondholders feeding the financialized economy in which money makes money without producing new goods and services the financialized economy has become a parasite feeding off the real economy driving producers and workers further and further into debt in the 1960s patman attempted to have the fed nationalized the effort failed but his committee did succeed in forcing the central bank to return its profits to the treasury after deducting its costs the prohibition against direct lending by the central bank to the government however remains in force the money power is still with the fomc and the banks a model we can no longer afford today the debt growth model has reached its limits as even the bank for international settlements the central bankers bank in switzerland acknowledges in its june 2016 annual report the bis said that debt levels were too high productivity growth was too low and the room for policy maneuver was too narrow the global economy cannot afford to rely any longer on the debt fueled growth model that has brought it to the current juncture the bis warned but the solutions it proposed would continue the austerity policies long imposed on countries that cannot pay their debts it prescribed prudential fiscal and above all structural policies structural readjustment that means privatizing public assets slashing services and raising taxes choking off the very productivity needed to pay the nations debts that approach has repeatedly been tried and has failed as witnessed for example in the devastated economy of greece meanwhile according to minneapolis fed president neel kashkari financial regulation since 2008 has reduced the chances of another government bailout only modestly from 84 percent to 67 percent that means there is still a 67 percent chance of another major systemwide crisis and this one could be worse than the last the biggest banks are bigger local banks are fewer and global debt levels are higher the economy has farther to fall the regulators models are obsolete aimed at a form of old fashioned banking that has long since been abandoned we need a new model one designed to serve the needs of the public and the economy rather than to maximize shareholder profits at public expense an earlier version of this article was published in truthout org ellen brown is an attorney founder of

of the downside is warranted charts a1 to a4 the 10 year u s treasury yield or interest rate may 31 2019 was 2 14 and presently my contention is given time has the potential to revisit the july 2016 low of 1 43 the november 2018 high was 3 24 that said we need to take this market a week at a time as we analyze global geopolitical dynamics and global government and central bank intervention u s dollar index the u s dollar index simply remains in a slowly rising sideways to up trading pattern which will likely be sustained for a period charts a5 to a8 the dollar is currently at 97 48 on june 3 2019 consider the following about the u s dollar first a rising dollar will place a drag on u s domestic and global growth given today s global economic dynamics second a neutral to lower dollar would be supportive of current u s economic activity and global economies in general and third currency imbalances remain one of global leadership s biggest challenges fourth china has a near term regional asian objective of expanding trade in their currency soybeans since february 2019 soybeans prices remained in a sideways to down trading range the potential trading range remains 7 77 to 9 30 per bushel given u s planting uncertainties may 31 2019 close 8 78 per bushel if support at 7 77 is lost then serious weakness to 7 00 becomes a real possibility but planting uncertainties remain charts b10 to b13 corn rain delayed planting continues problematic with final 2019 u s planted acreage remaining highly uncertain corn closing and holding the week of june 3 2019 above 4 40 would certainly open the door for a price advance to the 2014 price high of 5 19 that said producer efficiency swine flu global policy disputes and competition lagging exports and other geopolitical uncertainties are weighing heavy on this market may 31 2019 close 4 27 per bushel charts b14 to b17 long grain rice near term rice remains in a sideways trading range the primary trading range presently is july 10 25 to 11 48 per cwt or 4 61 to 5 17 per bushel may 31 2019 july close 11 46 per cwt or 5 16 per bushel bearish domestic and global fundamentals remain problematic for this market but hope remains march 29 2019 planting intentions will fall significantly short so now we wait on the june 28 2019 usda nass acreage report charts b18 to b20 cotton price weakness remains problematic cotton prices need to hold above 64 cents the week of june 3 2019 or serious price weakness could emerge may 31 2019 close 68 cents per pound charts b21 to b24 wheat price weakness remains wheat prices need to close the week may 27 2019 above 5 08 per bushel for me to consider a stronger near term price advance may 31 2019 close 5 03 per bushel we will adjust our estimates as market dynamics unfold charts b25 to b28 global equity etf acwi a bearish interpretation for this etf continues to develop support at 71 00 did not hold the week of may 27 2019 so potential downside to 67 00 or lower is now a consideration a slowly rising dollar will continue to put additional downside pressure on price global equity market performance as measured by the all country world index etf acwi a broad range of international developed equity and emerging market companies chart a19b on may 31 2019 had a value of 70 05 its previous all time high was 75 94 in january 2018 and its near term low was in december 2018 at 60 92 emerging markets etf eem this global emerging market etf remains dangerously weak which is a near term function of u s dollar strength global market rebalancing ununiform global economic momentum debt burdened emerging economies and global geopolitical uncertainties emerging markets etf eem chart a20 made a high in january 2018 of 50 98 a low in october 2018 of 37 02 may 31 2019 price was 40 70 the dollar s near term slowly unfolding strength china s aggressive policy actions negative impact on global economic activity coupled with european union economic uncertainties are three key factors which could limit near term potential upside to this etf s p 500 interesting building weakness as prices move from all time highs of 2954 on may 1 2019 may 31 2019 the s p 500 is at 2752 up from the december 2018 low of 2347 the s p 500 still has the potential to make new all time highs from current levels but if global economic momentum remains problematic then this index likely starts the process of defining a trading range in coming months crb index this index likely revisits or exceeds its december 2018 low of 168 as market participants continue to digest global economic and geopolitical uncertainties may 31 2019 close 175 with global deflationary forces remaining problematic with many of the world s commodities still surplus burdened with the ongoing global realignment of the world s currency bond equity and commodity markets and with a number of key global policy disputes there simply remain limitations to this index s near term upside unless oil prices regain their upward advance which presently seems to be waning as middle east tensions cool charts b1 to b5 wtic light crude oil light crude oil prices could not hold 55 74 the week of may 27 2019 so price weakness to 45 becomes a consideration may 31 2019 close 53 50 per barrel charts b6 to b9 bearish fundamentals geopolitical dynamics coupled with possible supply disruptions make this market

australia s had the housing boom and commodity boom and there s a question mark hanging over what drives growth next said su lin ong head of economic and fixed income strategy at royal bank of canada uk and european investors in particular expect australia to lower rates much further she said after all they ve been there to zero or the lower bound they ve seen that movie and they doubt australia is really any different not escaping next world shock just like all the rest that s something australia isn t used to hearing particularly after it managed to avoid being swept up in the asian financial crisis the early 2000s tech wreck and the 2009 global recession the next world shock we don t escape said bob gregory a professor at australian national university in canberra who has studied the economy for half a century but even without that i d say there s a 90 per cent chance the economy and employment growth slow from here because our boost from china and immigration is waning the australian dollar reflects similar doubts among investors about the economy s prospects it has slumped 25 per cent in the past five years and while that should aid exporters and import competing industries there s a sense of stasis among many firms that haven t had to fight for survival for a long time advertisement lowe who has kept the cash rate at 1 5 per cent since taking the helm in september 2016 used the record pause to try to deflate asset prices and stem a surge in household debt in order to increase the resilience of the financial system they are key components in his view on what constitutes a healthy economy he s also harnessed the bully pulpit to press other actors to take some of the load off monetary policy urging firms to invest to take advantage of australia s opportunities governments to embrace a reform agenda to help prolong the current expansion and workers to set aside fears over job security to demand higher wages to ensure a well functioning economy but outside persuading governments of the wisdom of investing in infrastructure particularly when finance is so cheap to boost economic capacity and hiring there has been little success that doesn t mean the rba chief hasn t won admirers along the way those speeches have been very interesting sort of get your act together you guys which is remarkable for a bank governor because 20 or 30 years ago that would ve caused a stir said gregory who served on the rba s board for 10 years it s interesting why there hasn t been a backlash partly i think because you re not getting realistic discussion out of the other economic agencies the believer advertisement yet if there s one economist who still believes in the australian growth story it seems to be the world s most important central banker fed chairman jerome powell has consistently rebutted questions about the inevitability of the record us expansion coming to an end by at australia most recently during a

texas comptroller glenn hegar joined a chorus of business leaders citing the economic risks of president trump s plan to impose tariffs on mexico as punishment for illegal immigration i fully understand and support president trump s efforts to increase security along our southern border hegar a republican said a statement friday however the free flow of goods between texas and mexico is critical to the texas economy an economy that has been a national leader in growth and job creation over the last decade considering that trade with mexico represents approximately 40 of trade volume in texas the negative impacts felt by texas could quickly ripple through the national economy hegar said so i urge the leaders of both nations to find a swift and lasting resolution to this issue as the state s accountant hegar monitors and reports the flow of revenues into the state primarily sales tax and tells lawmakers how much they can spend cross border shopping along the rio grande accounts for a sizeable share of monthly revenues which have set records every month for the last year bond financed toll bridges spanning the river rely on commerce across the region mexico is one of the u s s largest trading partners with a bilateral relationship valued at 671 billion last year according to the u s trade representative s office the plan to impose punitive tariffs coincides with a sudden drop in the price of oil a major source of revenue for texas the texas association of business and the texas mexico trade coalition joined forces on a statement condemning the tariffs as an inappropriate response to immigration issues immigration and trade are entirely separate issues and need to be treated as such by our administration said eddie aldrete chairman of the tmtc the u s does not need to be distancing themselves from mexico but working with them in a united effort at the southern borders while the date could end up being postponed the shockwaves are traveling in the meantime according to a note from bnp paribas we expect the mexican economy ministry to prepare tit for tat measures just in case adverse implications for inflation and the usmca process are evident which could reinforce our expectation that no monetary policy easing is at sight in announcing the new tariffs on thursday trump said he was taking the action to protect a u s economy invaded by hundreds of thousands of people coming through mexico and entering our country illegally trump said the tariffs on products entering the u s from mexico would begin at 5 on june 10 and rise to 10 on july 1 if mexico still has not taken action to dramatically reduce or eliminate the number of illegal aliens crossing its territory into the united states tariffs will be increased to 15 on aug 1 2019 to 20 on sept 1 2019 and to 25 on oct 1 2019 tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 level unless and until mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory should mexico choose not to cooperate on reducing unlawful migration the sustained imposition of tariffs will produce a massive return of jobs back to american cities and towns trump said manufacturing trade groups expressed confusion over trump s abrupt policy announcement as he was expected to begin seeking congressional approval of the new trade treaty with mexico and canada intended to replace the north american free trade agreement the new tariffs arose just days after trump lifted tariffs on mexican and canadian steel the administration s movement to impose tariffs undermines the same administration s effort to get congress to ratify the u s mexico canada trade agreement aldrete noted under nafta major firms designed manufacturing and supply systems using rail lines across the rio grande firms such as toyota general motors and ford have plants in both countries in the assembly process cars and trucks can cross the border several times in the process of final assembly these proposed tariffs would have devastating consequences on manufacturers in america and on american consumers said jay timmons president of the national association of manufacturers we have taken our concerns to the highest levels of the administration and strongly urge them to consider carefully the impact of this action on working families across this country although u s consumers buy more from china the u s sells more to mexico aldrete said mexico exported 346 5 billion in goods to the united states last year from vehicles to fruits and vegetables in march about 20 billion worth of goods flowed through laredo the growing border city recently passed los angeles as the nation s largest port although the policy if enacted could harm the economy trump s supporters see the hardline stance as a political winner heading into the 2020 presidential election democrats in congress are fully aware of this horrible situation and yet refuse to help in any way shape or form trump said this is a total dereliction of duty the migrant crisis is a calamity that must now be solved and can easily be solved in congress republican texas gov greg abbott joined trump in blaming congressional democrats for the tariffs which he said he did not favor republican lt gov dan patrick trump s leading supporter in texas has not issued a statement on the tariffs but has previously backed the president s plan to build a wall on the u s side of the rio grande and offered state funds to help finance the project patrick who headed trump s 2016 campaign in texas missed the opening day of the texas senate as presiding officer to help trump write a speech about the border wall although trump has pitched the tariffs as punishment for mexico texas economist ray perryman said that tariffs are actually a form of taxation on u s consumers who eventually pay the penalties through higher prices trump s escalating trade war with china has already resulted in lower import volume in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2018 even beyond tariffs are changes in investment patterns supply chains and strategic plans perryman said chinese investments in the u s have fallen sharply already corporations have announced moves from china to other nations for manufacturing facilities to avoid trade complications the perryman group estimates that the proposed tariffs would lead to an increase in direct costs of about 28 1 billion each year and when multiplier effects are considered the net losses to the u s economy include an estimated 41 5 billion in gross domestic product and 24 6 billionin income each year the overall job loss would be about 406 000 texas would bear the lion s share of this loss given the extensive commerce that occurs between the state and mexico perryman said the perryman group estimates that the proposed 5 tariff would result in additional direct costs of 8 7 billion when multiplier effects are considered these higher costs would likely cause losses to the texas economy including almost 11 9 billion in gross product and nearly 7 1 billion in income each year as well as 117 335 jobs in el paso jon barela chief executive officer of the borderplex alliance a regional economic development organization called the tariffs a consumer tax on americans that will lead to job losses in the borderplex region and throughout america the borderplex region is the fourth largest manufacturing hub in north america and the president s actions will have a devastating impact on our local economy barela said in a prepared statement the borderplex includes maquiladoras or factories in juárez chihuahua by companies from the united states and other countries el paso area companies support the maquiladoras by making parts for the mexican plants and operating warehouses and other logistics operations for the assembled products coming out of mexico the borderplex includes santa teresa n m where construction of a 73 million section of trump s border wall began in april 2018 the wall will stand 18 feet to 30 feet tall in different areas depending on the terrain

negotiations afcfta the african continental free trade agreement loss of sovereignty lack of transparency aidc 27 may 2019 the african continental free trade agreement loss of sovereignty lack of transparency by jonathan cannard the african union s assembly of heads of state and government conceived of the african continental free trade agreement afcfta in 2012 with the goal of creating a continental free trade area by 2017 in march 2018 the majority of au member states signed the agreement to establish the free trade area with most remaining au members signing later in 2018 or early 2019 notably nigeria is the only major african economy not to sign the agreement and it has expressed resistance to doing so as of early may 2019 one month after ratification by 22 member states the free trade area will come into existence 30 may 2019 has been set as the date of entry into force if completed the free trade area will be africa s contribution to the global rise in megaregional trade agreements such as the proposed trans pacific partnership and trans atlantic trade and investment partnership the afcfta will also have the largest number of country members of any post wto agreement comprising 1 2 billion people free trade agreements may improve certain economic indicators such as gdp and balance of trade however such agreements have been shown to increase wealth inequality only serving to intensify the profit making of the wealthy given the poverty and unemployment plaguing the african continent it is pertinent to ask why the continent s leaders are pursuing a free trade agreement rather than policies that will benefit the majority of the population the answer lies in the fact that the very leaders pushing for the afcfta are also those who will benefit economically from increased intra continental trade the agreement seeks to create a single market on the continent as well as to increase intra african trade through liberalisation africa has the lowest rate of internal trade of any continent but the afcfta has the potential to boost intra continental trade by 30 55 depending on the models used these models however say nothing of what is being traded and who will benefit the agreement is premised on the notion that trade liberalisation through both tariff and non tariff barrier reduction will drastically increase intra continental trade and that this increased trade will be beneficial for all as is consistent with the ideological framework of free trade the afcfta adheres to the myth that a rising tide lifts all boats despite empirical evidence to the contrary the agreement has been mired in controversy from the start particularly given the distinct lack of transparency in negotiations civil society and organised labour have largely been denied access to the negotiating table leaving many highly critical of what has gone on behind closed doors for example the manufacturer s association of nigeria and the four million strong nigerian labour congress nlc have fought vehemently and thus far successfully to stop nigeria from joining the free trade area often citing the secrecy of the negotiations and lack of input from non governmental bodies nigerian president muhammadu buhari cancelled nigeria s participation rightly stating that nigeria will not agree to anything that will undermine local manufacturers and entrepreneurs or that may lead to nigeria becoming a dumping ground for finished goods whereas ayuba wabba national president of the nlc expressed concerns that the afcfta is an extremely dangerous and radioactive neo liberal policy initiative a controversial issue within the afcfta negotiations as in all trade agreement negotiations is over the question of investment disputes many 21st century trade agreements include investor state dispute settlement isds provisions isds allows private foreign investors to raise disputes against states they are investing in if there is a threat to their investment or even a threat to the profitability of the investment multiple states around the world have begun to realise the loss of sovereignty posed by isds private investors including tncs may challenge a state s domestic laws in an international tribunal if said laws pose a threat to the profit making of the investor the most common forum for such disputes is the international centre for the settlement of investment disputes icsid which is an organ of the world bank group and therefore far from impartial investment negotiations including investment dispute procedures will be involved in phase 2 of the afcfta discussions expected to begin in the second half of 2019 multiple african states have expressed wariness about isds and favour state to state investment dispute settlement therefore the current text of the agreement includes provisions to create a state to state dispute settlement body rather than isds there is some resistance to isds within the au however tncs non african foreign investors and wealthy african elites have consistently pushed for isds this must be monitored so as to ensure that isds is not included in phase 2 exemplary of the lack of transparency in negotiations the exact tariff reduction schedules in the agreement have still not been announced as of may 2019 although it is unknown to what degree signatory states will be required to cut their tariffs the experiences of previous liberalisation programmes can show the potentially harmful effects of the afcfta tariff liberalisation will inevitably displace workers in countries that already experience high levels of unemployment and it will probably lower wages even further in many sectors at least in the short term industries that currently enjoy some level of protection and nurturing behind tariff barriers will be completely exposed to global market forces through the agreement the increased competition that results will certainly lead to job losses in various sectors orthodox economics assumes that workers displaced through liberalisation will be quickly and easily absorbed into gainful employment in other sectors the removal of trade distortions will supposedly allow each country to exploit its competitive advantages and short term displacements will be made up for by long term growth this is the rhetoric employed by proponents of the afcfta but it is far removed from the lived realities of destructive trade liberalisation already carried out across the globe the african agricultural sector is very much under threat from the free trade area small scale farmers make up a large portion of the continent s population liberalisation of agriculture has been shown to favour economies of scale and therefore large industrial farms particularly those using monocrop techniques for the cash crop export market subsistence farmers and those growing food crops for domestic consumption may be dislocated by industrial farms leading to intensified urbanisation and proletarianisation increased food prices decreased food security and the loss of biodiversity some commentators have noted that a reduction of food crop production capacity on the continent will simply serve to open the market for food imports derived from large agribusinesses both african and non african increased trade in itself will not drive industrialisation or development it must be accompanied by appropriate policies the afcfta through tariff reduction takes away one of the continent s last remaining tools for designing development policies many post colonial african states have been required to undergo structural adjustment programmes saps and other forced fiscal austerity measures conditional for the advancement of much needed credit this has reduced the policy space available to african governments as they have been required to follow the development paths put forward by their creditors this severe erosion of national sovereignty has left countries with few tools for development and industrialisation although some tariffs have been allowed to remain tariffs are an important source of revenue contribute to price controls prevent against flooding or dumping and are crucial in protecting local industries the afcfta will further the removal of tariff barriers eliminating one of the last tools available to african states although in previous liberalisation programmes it has been foreign states dictating the economic restructuring of african economies in this case it is african states themselves the agreement will not be in the economic interest of the poor african masses the peasant and working classes along with the unemployed living in urban and peri urban slums will gain little or nothing from the free trade area those who own large businesses those who profit off the toil of others have much to benefit from tariff liberalisation the afcfta is not driven primarily by western states as with the wto or saps rather it is driven by the wealthy african elite at the expense of those they claim to represent the most developed countries and particularly the late industrialisers employed industrial policy to grow their manufacturing sectors states successfully managed to reduce dependence on imports through the nurturing of domestic infant industries until such time as said industries were strong enough to survive exposure to international market competition tariffs play an important role in industrial policy and through liberalisation such as that seen in the afcfta states lose the ability to formulate such policies liberalisation in developing countries has largely resulted in a reliance on the export of primary commodities weak domestic industries particularly manufacturing are destroyed by pre existing large foreign industries often dominated by transnational corporations multiple african countries have used tariffs for successful import substitution such as cote d ivoire s poultry production and nigeria s cement production the afcfta allows states to exempt from liberalisation up to 10 of their export value to other african countries this provides a small amount of relief but it does not allow enough policy space for states to truly choose their own development paths and reject the export led dependence forming washington consensus approach an increase in intra african trade has significant potential for promoting and even formalising south south cooperation and solidarity it is possible that the afcfta will assist in increasing trade within the continent however liberalisation alone will not lead to industrialisation or development liberalisation must be accompanied by policies and programmes that will ensure that those inevitably displaced by market integration will be re incorporated into the economy this requires structural transformation rather than simply liberalisation the afcfta in its current form simply continues to open up african countries to the international market without providing a framework for developmental policies tariff and quota policies were some of the few tools left for african states in defending their domestic industries from the international market but the afcfta is set to take away even these tools this is not to say that african countries should pursue protectionist trade policies however nor should states subscribe to the free trade paradigm industrial and trade policies often including tariffs rather than full market exposure have been shown to be fruitful in development this is particularly true in regards to more lucrative economic activities such as services and the production of high value manufactured goods trade agreements such as the afcfta remove states ability to formulate their own legitimate paths to development cementing the current model of raw material and low value goods exporting coupled with reliance on imports of food and value added goods there is significant attention currently being given to the afcfta as it could have serious impacts on the whole continent most commentators maintain favourable views of the agreement and the creation of the free trade area some have even positively compared the free trade area to kwame nkrumah s vision of a united and revolutionary africa there may be some reason to believe that this agreement could promote a significant increase in intra african trade and solidarity however the agreement has been shrouded in secrecy from the beginning of negotiations there has been little to no input from civil society social movements or the communities that will be affected by the free trade area this lack of transparency and inclusion is deeply worrying the creation of the text was undemocratic to the core and remains opaque african states have long been dispossessed of their ability to independently formulate a path to development the afcfta driven from within the continent further cements this dispossession removing the ability of states to impose tariffs among many other measures that could be used in economic development and industrialisation programmes rather than making drastic structural changes to the systems of production within africa the afcfta may intensify the race to the bottom between working classes on the continent other trade agreements such as the trans pacific partnership tpp have received large amounts of civil society resistance but the afcfta has largely been ignored despite its imitation of many tpp provisions as the free trade area comes into effect civil society and social movements must be sure to critically engage in the debates surrounding it

for centuries governments have taxed borrowed or created money to pay for public spending all carry risks heavy taxes dampen growth and upset voters excessive public borrowing triggers financial crises printing money to pay for public spending can look tempting but as rulers from henry viii to venezuela s nicolás maduro have discovered creating money out of thin air and spending it tends to destroy confidence and send inflation rocketing in economics as in investing if something looks too good to be true it generally is so imagine finding a way to increase spending without borrowing taxing or creating inflation yet in simplified form this is pretty much the promise of a policy getting a lot of airtime in america at the moment modern monetary theory or mmt mmt asserts that a government that prints and borrows in its own currency cannot go bankrupt since it can always print more money to pay back debt the argument runs that since it can print money to pay off its debts such a government can also do so to pay for public services this is a truly radical idea supporters of mmt argue that government should print money and spend it as long as the economy is operating with spare capacity i e it has unemployed workers or underused factories once spare capacity is used up and the economy risks overheating proponents of mmt say the government should stop spending and raise taxes to dampen activity and inflation to its supporters mmt avoids many of the disadvantages of traditional forms of economic policy voters get better public services with unchanged taxes there s no extra public borrowing to alarm deficit hawks and it won t push up private borrowing and asset prices in the way qe quantitative easing has in the last ten years now it s worth noting that both mmt and qe involve the government creating money electronically or more graphically though incorrectly printing it but with qe a central bank creates money to buy assets such as government bonds this injection of new money into the system drives down interest rates and bolsters asset prices under mmt by contrast the government spends the money directly on public services that s one crucial difference and from it a second follows with qe as practised in the us and europe central banks have promised to reverse money creation they can do so because unlike under mmt the money that has been created has been swapped for assets which can be sold the idea is that central banks will in time sell these assets withdrawing money from the system and dampening asset prices and activity this has so far convinced investors that the new money created will eventually be absorbed back into the system the message from central banks is that qe does not represent a permanent expansion in the supply of dollars euros and pounds by contrast the money created under mmt will be spent on public services and not in purchasing assets and since there are no assets to sell in future the money created is permanent these are important differences they explain why so many prominent us economists from fed chair jay powell to former treasury secretary larry summers have raised concerns over mmt the most obvious danger is of runaway inflation if investors think a central bank would print money at the whims of the government they are likely to get rid of money and buy other assets to protect against inflation that could cause the currency to collapse and inflation to soar a related concern is that government with its infinite spending power could hoover up people and resources and crowd out the private sector this would reduce the tax take and could tempt the government to print more money to fill the gap more fundamentally the state could end up with a far greater role in allocating capital in the economy the market has flaws and limitations but it tends to be better at allocating capital and raising efficiency than the government a worry therefore is that mmt could enfeeble the private sector with numerous critics and few true believers among politicians mmt is unlikely to see action in the us even on the political left its support is qualified while stephanie kelton one of mmt s leading proponents worked as an adviser to democrat presidential hopeful bernie sanders in 2016 mr sanders has never explicitly endorsed the policy mmt s most high profile advocate is democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez though she is not committed to it saying mmt needs to be a larger part of our conversation yet the debate sparked by mmt highlights a willingness to push the boundaries of policy in pursuit of faster more inclusive growth critics of the status quo point out that ten years of easy money have not stoked inflation nor has a soaring federal budget deficit and vast issuance of us treasury bills unsettled investors this is an environment in which radical economic ideas such as mmt are attracting attention to me mmt sounds rather like alchemy the age old search for ways of turning base metals into gold given the damage caused by the last recession i shouldn t be surprised it has reinvigorated the eternal search for new and faster paths to prosperity
rttnews the major u s index futures are currently pointing to a lower opening on monday with stocks likely to add to the steep losses posted last week trade concerns may continue to weigh on wall street after an official document from the chinese government blamed the u s for the escalating trade dispute between the world s two largest economies the white paper issued by china s state council information office argued the u s is solely responsible for the collapse of trade talks china accused president donald trump s administration of continually changing its demands arguing the setbacks in the talks were all the result of u s breach of consensus and commitments and backtracking at a press conference in beijing on sunday chinese vice commerce minister wang shouwen denied trump s claims that china had been the side seeking to renegotiate a nearly completed agreement nothing is agreed until everything is agreed wang said noting that china remains willing to resolve the trade dispute but only with an agreement that benefits both countries wang stressed china will not give ground on issues of principle calling on the u s to meet china half way uphold the spirit of mutual respect equality and mutual benefit and jointly promote the stable and healthy development of bilateral economic and trade relations negotiations will get nowhere if one side tries to coerce the other or if only one party will benefit from the outcomes the white paper said after ending thursday s choppy trading session modestly higher stocks showed a substantial move back to the downside during trading on friday with the sell off on the day the dow dropped to a four month closing low while the nasdaq and the s p 500 hit their lowest closing levels in well over two months the major averages

and the s p 500 plummeted by 2 4 percent and 2 6 percent respectively the sell off on wall street came after president donald trump revealed plans to use tariffs to compel mexico to make efforts to stop the flow of illegal immigrants across the country and into the u s on june 10th the united states will impose a 5 tariff on all goods coming into our country from mexico until such time as illegal migrants coming through mexico and into our country stop trump announced in a post on twitter he added the tariff will gradually increase until the illegal immigration problem is remedied at which time the tariffs will be removed trump revealed in a subsequent white house statement the tariffs will be raised to 10 percent on july 1st if the crisis persists with tariffs eventually rising as high as 25 percent by october 1st the president argued the sustained imposition of tariffs will produce a massive return of jobs back to u s describing the move as an effort to firmly and forcefully stand up for america s interests we have confidence that mexico can and will act swiftly to help the united states stop this long term dangerous and deeply unfair problem trump said the united states has been very good to mexico for many years he added we are now asking that mexico immediately do its fair share to stop the use of its territory as a conduit for illegal immigration into our country the threat of new tariffs on mexican imports comes amid the escalating trade dispute between the u s and china which has recently weighed on stocks and raised concerns about the

will nigeria s economy gather momentum in h2 2019 the news that nigeria s economy cooled down to 2 05 per cent in the first quarter q1 of 2019 compared to 2 38 per cent in q4 of 2018 has left investors wondering about the chances of growth gathering momentum during the second half of the year on the one hand it s an encouraging sign to see the fastest first quarter growth since 2015 driven mainly by the non oil sector which grew 2 47 per cent while the oil sector shrank by 2 4 per cent sending a worrying signal that it isn t doing as well as it should be even amid rising oil prices it is becoming increasingly clear that economic growth is unlikely to reach the ambitious target of the economic recovery and growth plan ergp put at seven per cent but may get the central bank of nigeria s target of 2 47 per cent for this to happen the growth trend in the oil sector would need to rebound and the services sector would need to sustain its current strength added momentum could stem from oil prices should they hit a bullish streak going forward supporting the economy as the oil trade still accounts for a handsome chunk of the nation s foreign exchange earnings there are other potential areas of growth regionally there is a significant development which could increase economic efficiencies and trade within africa the african continental free trade area afcfta which comes into effect on may 30 although nigeria hasn t yet joined afcfta there s still a chance it will do so once discussions are completed with stakeholders in addition to opening intra africa trade relations the afcfta gives multi national companies the chance to set up in one african country and be passported to another 52 countries within a common market made up of over one billion people increased access to foreign expertise and investment could improve local manufacturing and processing systems while driving more growth and jobs creation in the best case scenario standardised trading agreements across afcfta members may open up trading channels which could lead to increased company sales revenues and profits nigeria sells just 12 7 per cent of its total exports to other african countries so if the treaty is ratified there s scope for increased government and company revenues from a boost in trade general there needs to be a stronger push in diversifying away from oil reliance to other sources of sustainable growth an important part of sustainable growth is investment sentiment and the current economic stability along with easing inflationary pressures which may lead to a more dovish central bank of nigeria cbn monetary policy by way of interest rate cuts if so a reduction in interest rates would stimulate borrowing and investment from local businesses which in turn would support economic growth a more robust economy plus foreign exchange reserves rising towards 45 billion would likely provide ammunition for the cbn to defend the naira another factor impacting on nigeria s recovery is the external threat of the united states china trade negotiations which could end up pressuring oil prices if the result is a global slowdown meaning less demand for oil the dollar is staying strong amid the trade tensions and should they intensify further they will hit emerging markets where it hurts in their currency exchanges this would undermine the naira while pressuring consumer spending and on top of that falling oil prices would likely dent government revenues looking ahead there is scope for nigeria s economy to gather momentum in the second half of the year provided some key basics of growth are kept in focus supportive monetary policy keeping consumer spending healthy sustaining investor confidence and improving economic infrastructure particularly in the oil sector even if the risks stemming from us china trade disputes are out of nigeria s hands shoring up the domestic economy could help it weather any storms the worst case alternative is less attractive if a global slowdown is triggered due to the trade tensions economic growth in nigeria may follow suit meaning the cbn will face more difficult challenges to support the naira and wider economy through monetary policy otunuga is a research analyst at fxtm

following the ratification of the african continental free trade agreement by the gambia on april 2nd and the deposit of instruments of ratification by the saharawi republic on april 29th the agreement which outlines the african continental free trade area afcfta came into force last thursday this paved the path for the agreement to enter its operational phase following a summit on july 7th the continental trade pact seeks to remove tariffs on 90 of the goods and services traded between the signatories to the agreement and gradually eliminate other non tariff barriers to trade on the african continent as of january this year 49 out of 55 african nations had signed the framework agreement on afcfta in effect creating the largest free trade area in the world in terms of participating countries since the creation of the world trade organisation wto in 1995 in so doing the signatories took the biggest step towards advancing intra african trade creating employment opportunities and fostering integration on a continent that was fragmented by colonial imperialists during the berlin conference between 1884 85 regrettably and despite the opportunity to get rid of the colonial legacy and unnatural borders that have divided the continent africa s largest economy by gdp and population nigeria which took over the processes leading to the afcfta agreement from egypt and even led the way at the ministerial level unexpectedly opted out of signing the agreement on march 21 2018 other countries yet to sign the agreement include benin republic and eritrea but it is nigeria s absence from the free trade bloc that has been the most conspicuous and set tongues wagging over the shortsightedness of the administration in not recognising the potential in the free trade treaty egged on by the manufacturers association of nigeria man and the confounded labour unions president muhammadu buhari said at the time of abstaining from the signing that nigeria would not do anything that would undermine local manufacturers and entrepreneurs the president of the nigeria labour congress nlc ayuba wabba went on to describe the afcfta as an extremely dangerous and radioactive neo liberal policy initiative that seeks to open our seaports airports and other businesses to unbridled foreign interference never before witnessed in the history of the country yet nigeria currently has the largest concentration of people living in extreme poverty in the world with the worst hit group being children and teens under the age of 15 worse still this number is growing definitely something has to give but all hope was not lost when shortly afterwards the nigerian government assured the african union the driving force behind afcfta that its non participation was a delay not a withdrawal and promised to sign the agreement soon it noted that more consultation was needed with local businesses in order to ensure private sector buy in to the agreement eventually an impact assessment report on afcfta as demanded by the president was presented to him by the former minister of industry trade and investment dr okey enelamah yet no word has been heard from the presidency on if nigeria will key into the continent s largest trade pact before it s too late it must be said however that the issue of afcfta did feature in the 2019 campaigns the presidential candidate of the opposition peoples democratic party alhaji atiku abubakar who is pro business did promise to make nigeria a member of the free trade bloc but with his loss at the polls and the country in transition mode concerns persist over the delay on nigeria s participation in the regional trade bloc much of the delay has been blamed on the perception among manufacturers and the unions that the free trade era will usher in massive dumping crippling of tenuous industries job losses loss of economic clout in the region and even the erosion of existing customs and border controls some have also argued that nigeria is not ripe for afcfta because of the prohibitive cost of doing business in the country brought on by inadequate power supply the infrastructure deficit rising insecurity and inaccessible seaports but my take on all the issues that have been raised by man and the labour unions is that they are grossly misplaced first and foremost by joining the trade pact we have nothing to fear about the loss of sovereign military or regional clout afcfta is a basic trade agreement it is neither a customs union nor a single market for nigeria to be prosperous we need to trade and invest with africans with the population of the african continent inching towards 2 2 billion people by 2050 and populations shrinking in the rest of the world this presents an opportunity and market for nigerian companies to capture market share right from the formation of the free trade area on the continent besides the only way to be prosperous is to produce higher value added goods and services in africa that will be bought by africans indeed just last friday the advisory partner with pricewaterhousecoopers pwc dr andre nevin rightly added on the breakfast show on arise tv the broadcast arm of the thisday media group that what the country needs is a manufacturing sector that is 10 15 times bigger than the manufacturing sector that we have today to be prosperous so it is not today s manufacturers that should be our focus what we should be concerned with is how to create the environment where we have a bigger and more buoyant manufacturing sector according to him the focus should shift from exporting raw materials to semi and fully processed goods with greater value added as raw materials only represent 5 10 of the value of finished goods so if we do not trade with africans and invest in africa we will be poor africa has suffered due to colonization and fractionalization of the continent afcfta presents an excellent opportunity to come out as one bloc which will have economic relations with other big countries and regional blocs with a potential market of 2 billion people others will be forced to listen and contend with us just as they do with the eu european union another case to be made for the african free trade bloc has to do with the trade between the 55 african union member states currently put at about 18 of total exports from the continent compared with 69 in europe 59 in asia and 31 in north america this is particularly important when considering that manufactured goods make up a much greater proportion of intra africa trade than trade with the rest of the world which is mainly focused on raw materials despite this and the fact that africa is the second most populous continent nigeria s main trading partners are all in europe asia and the americas it must be added that even the goods and services that make up 18 of intra african trade are transacted primarily through the informal sector what this implies is that the nigerian government has to bring the informal sector which accounts for 65 of the nigerian economy to the formal sector this can be achieved by eliminating the barriers that restrict the informal sector so that participants can transit to the formal sector avenues to do this include bringing down the exorbitant cost of entry by way of multiple taxation over regulation bureaucratic bottlenecks issuance of visa on arrival to citizens of afcfta member states as well as ease of access in and out of the seaports as it stands the seaports in the apapa area of lagos are completely inaccessible thus increasing the turnaround time that it takes for importers and exporters to move their goods in and out of the ports while those outside lagos with shallow draughts cannot be accessed by very large ships protectionist barriers as advocated by man and labour should also be discarded as isolationism will make it difficult for local businesses to scale abroad and thus make them less attractive for foreign direct investment whereas it is important to acknowledge the downside risk for local businesses and the nigerian economy what the government should be concerned with is how to address the problems caused by our infrastructure deficit in order to become competitive there is no reason for the government s inability to address these fundamental problems frontally by staying away from the afcfta we will simply be burying our heads in the sand by not addressing the fundamental issues that make nigeria uncompetitive ultimately this will impede economic growth moreover the threat posed by an integrated african market under the continental free trade agreement will force us to raise our competitiveness level if we can compete within the african continent surely we can compete globally as nevin advocated eventually market forces will defeat the case for market protection and the best way to be ahead of the curve is to prime your economy to be competitive one of the merits of afcfta is that it will force us to look inwards and learn how to swim against the oncoming storm another consideration for nigerian policy makers is for the redeployment of the humongous financial resources nigeria currently wastes on subsidising the cost of petrol that we consume just last week it was revealed that the country had spent n11 trillion on fuel subsidies over a six year period for a country recording tepid economic growth and whose citizens are sliding into poverty that is a monstrous travesty and is reflective of our penchant for wrong headed decisions like i have advocated for years in this column sensible countries subsidise production not consumption rather than spend trillions keeping the cost of petrol low it would make more sense to channel those trillions in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors by way of direct cash transfers grants or tax breaks in order to encourage production and keep prices of consumer goods low but to ensure that the policy is not abused and in order to guard against long term supply disruptions such subsidies to the productive sector should be limited to not more than five years which is sufficient time for local businesses to stand on their two feet unaided and for a focused government to keep building and improving on its infrastructure even concerns about dumping can be checkmated quite effectively through the deployment of blockchain technology at our ports of entry blockchain is an open incorruptible digital ledger that records commercial transactions between two parties efficiently in a verifiable and permanent way by design a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data with the introduction of blockchain the technology will enable customs officials to detect where goods are coming from and where it is determined that they are coming from outside the continent appropriate tariffs can be imposed for nevin the solution is to have a better view of the supply chain and make sure that african goods and services can trade freely and other goods cannot effectively the rules for consumer goods coming from afcfta member countries will be set by africa and another set of rules for goods coming from other continents with this in place concerns raised by manufacturers such as dangote cement that they find it more difficult to sell their goods to benin republic because of the tariffs and taxes imposed on their cement than it is for china to export cement to benin will be allayed this is no different from what obtains in the eurozone area today where there are no barriers to goods and services traded among members of the eu but barriers exist for non members of the union in reality this is one of the primary reasons britain s exit from the eu has been so contentious because the ease with which it moves its good and services will cease to exist once it leaves the eu then there is also the case to be made for entrepreneurship in nigeria about 49 of nigerians aged 18 64 are entrepreneurs almost three times the global average as evidenced in lagos alaba international market perhaps the biggest new venture incubator in the world most of these entrepreneurs work in retail the afcfta would give them more options for sourcing and consequently drive their costs down non retail entrepreneurs would also benefit from the ability to build more sophisticated value chains for improved operations

washington president trump s tax cuts provided a temporary jolt to the united states economy by putting more money into taxpayers pockets the tariffs that mr trump has grown so fond of may have the opposite effect two new analyses show that the tariffs mr trump is using to punish china mexico europe and other governments would more than wipe out any gains from his 1 5 trillion tax cut for low and middle income earners leaving them with less money to spend into a consumer driven economy higher earners would fare only slightly better with their tax gains significantly eroded but not entirely washed away the potential for mr trump s tariffs to nullify his signature tax cut shows how the president s trade war could undermine his biggest selling point going into his 2020 re election campaign a strong economy investors bond markets and wall street analysts appear increasingly alarmed by the potential slowdown in growth that could result from mr trump s trade escalations including his plan to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on mexican goods and to tax everything that china imports into the united states he is also mulling tariffs on imported automobiles from europe and japan

love your countrymen baroness ros altmann member of the house of lords get the full ray dalio series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on ray dalio in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q1 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc populism vis à vis misallocated capital ros altmann is a long standing friend of mine and an ardent supporter of a united europe like i am i often think of ros and the brave battle she is fighting in westminster these days to keep europe together having said that this month s absolute return letter is not about brexit but about populism although there is a powerful link between the two more on that below i will look at the costs associated with rising populism and i will argue that one of the biggest costs is plenty of misallocated capital don t get me wrong though populism often leads to a lot more than rising amounts of misallocated capital one of the worst being an increased risk of war but after all this is a financial newsletter i am not going to speculate on whether the presence of donald trump nigel farage or boris johnson probably the next prime minister of the uk could result in war i will stick to the financial costs associated with rising populism misallocated capital is a term i will bring up repeatedly in this month s letter so let s define what it actually is economists use the term to describe capital that is deployed unproductively one example as society ages more and more capital will be set aside to service the elderly and that is at least in economic terms an unproductive use of capital i e it is misallocated that is only the short answer though here is the slightly longer and more correct one assume you make a portfolio investment or purchase a business or other asset and that the return on that portfolio investment or business is below your cost of capital if that is the case the capital you deployed in the first place is said to have been misallocated in order to adjust for the cyclical ups and downs the capital was only misallocated if the return is below the cost of capital when assessed over a full economic cycle a quick word on brexit a quick word or two on brexit before i begin here in the uk it is virtually impossible to do anything these days without brexit somehow entering the frame even at dinner parties with family and friends if you start the meal by agreeing not to talk about brexit sooner or later it enters the conversation anyway and i have heard of entire families that have fallen out as a result of the mess in westminster things are not easy in the uk at the moment only a few weeks ago i came across an article in the new york times written by thomas l friedman which sums up better than anything else i have read more recently why the british are getting it so horribly wrong friedman argues that the british have totally lost perspective of the big picture let me quote what i think was one of the finest passages in a great article trump is fine with a world of competitive european nationalisms not a strong european union so is vladimir putin so it seems are the brexiteers how quickly they ve all forgotten that the eu and nato were built to prevent the very competitive nationalism that ran riot in europe in the 20th century and brought us two world wars nationalism is a key driver of populism and populism is a key driver of the political agenda in more and more countries around the world in europe alone populist parties have more than tripled their share of the total vote over the past 20 years with populist leaders being in government now in 11 european countries source the guardian more than 25 of all europeans now vote for a populist exhibit 1 exhibit 1 populist vote share in europe 1998 2018 source the guardian in what is to follow i will argue that populism leads to plenty of capital being misallocated obviously both private and public capital can be misallocated but in the context of this month s absolute return letter which zooms in on populism it goes without saying that i am referring predominantly to public capital what exactly is populism the rise of populism in europe is most definitely a consequence of the middle classes being financially squeezed more on this later but it is also a function of the series of crises europe has been subjected to in recent years serious economic problems in greece the war against isis and the subsequent stream of refugees from syria and iraq plenty of illegal immigrants numerous terror attacks etc the cambridge dictionary defines populism as political ideas and activities that are intended to get the support of ordinary people by giving them what they want if ordinary people feel their living standards are under pressure as they arguably are a scapegoat needs to be identified so that something or somebody can take the blame for their misery here in the uk not one but two scapegoats have already been identified immigrants who supposedly take jobs away from ordinary people and the eu which supposedly runs the country these days that neither of those two claims are even remotely true is entirely irrelevant to these people populism is far from a new trend every now and then it rears its ugly head more often than not with devastating implications to follow adolf hitler was the most notorious populist of the 20th century he took advantage of a desperately poor german populace who needed something to change after years of despair deutsche bank research runs a populism index exhibit 2 as you can see we are going through a phase now not dissimilar to 1935 39 where a sharply rising gap between rich and poor also led to a monumental rise in populism exhibit 2 populism index source deutsche bank reseach the rising gap between rich and poor is the gap between rich and poor really getting bigger or is it just hearsay let s turn to the world inequality report 2018 which you can find here i strongly recommend you download and read this report it is deeply fascinating spending power is very much a function of income but it is also a function of wealth assuming you have any through most of the 20th century the wealthiest 10 lost out to the bottom 90 i e the gap between rich and poor got smaller but that all changed in the 1980s as we entered the great equity bull market exhibit 3 the extraordinarily benign financial market conditions of the last 30 40 years have been a major source of wealth creation since the early 1980s the rich began to grab a bigger slice of the pie and have done so ever since in other words even if the poorest 90 are wealthier than ever before when measured in absolute terms they feel poorer as they can see the wealthiest building their wealth much faster exhibit 3 the wealthiest 10 s share of total wealth by country source world inequality report 2018 a similar story on income growth switching from wealth to income growth a similar picture is unfolding if we rewind to the absolute return letter of november 2017 which you can find here you may recall that i introduced the now in famous elephant chart based on work conducted by a research team at world bank in 2013 the chart revealed that between 1988 and 2008 the middle classes of the developed world were the big losers doing even worse than the poorest people of this world the middle classes of emerging markets fared much better only surpassed by the global elite who did the best of all in terms of income growth another group of economists have since updated world bank s work from 2013 and have found that the gap between rich and poor is even bigger now than it was only a decade ago exhibit 4 a team led by facundo alvaredo lucas chancel and famous inequality research trio thomas piketty emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman updated the elephant chart in the 2018 world inequality report exhibit 4 global real income growth by percentile 1980 2016 source world inequality database as you can see the top 1 of income earners captured no less than 27 of the total growth in income between 1980 and 2016 meanwhile the bottom 90 got squeezed at least in the us and europe and that is consistent with world bank s 2013 findings exhibit 4 is global in nature but the oecd regularly collects data on real income growth on a country by country basis as is evident when looking at exhibit 5 below the uk comes out as one of the outliers with negative real wage growth when measured in absolute terms between 2008 and 2017 only mexico and greece have fared worse than the uk in the last 10 years or so exhibit 5 real wage growth by country 2008 17 source the economist oecd what happens when the gap between rich and poor grows all over the world the middle classes underwrite economic and political stability hence when the middle classes are unsettled so is society at large in the us they chose a political outsider as their next president in the uk they chose an uncertain future outside the eu in italy they chose a comedian to run the biggest political party the middle classes of those three countries sent exactly the same message to the establishment we are not happy with the state of affairs something needs to change we want a better life i am not even sure all those people know precisely what it is that must change but something needs to every now and then a populist shows up on the stage seeking to take advantage of the general discontent and from that point things tend to get hairy as i mentioned earlier when people are unhappy they start looking for scapegoats and sometimes the choice of scapegoat defies logic if the middle classes of the uk feel increasingly squeezed as they do perhaps they should have a go at the super rich instead of blaming the eu an institution that has nothing whatsoever to do with the rising gap between rich and poor as eu governance rules are based on consensus in effect the eu epitomises what populists despise and because of the eu governance model everything takes time which often makes the eu a scapegoat for problems that have nothing whatsoever to do with it many populists argue that the eu is undemocratic in reality it is anything but perhaps even a little too democratic sometimes why rising populism will lead to slowing gdp growth up to this point my logic has been fairly straightforward a rising gap between rich and poor has led to broad discontent amongst ordinary people which has paved the way for populists so far so good but now it gets a tad more complicated i will now argue that rising populism is at least partly to blame for the slowdown in economic growth that we have been subjected to in recent years why is that we know that capital being misallocated leads to falling productivity growth and we know that productivity growth is one of the two basic drivers of gdp growth hence if populism leads to capital being misallocated populism will by definition lead to slowing gdp growth what is it that populists do that cause capital to be misallocated populists do what ordinary people want politicians to do irrespective of the economic rationale example 1 only a few days ago boris johnson declared that the uk will leave the eu in october deal or no deal does that make any economic sense whatsoever absolutely not could it lead to much more capital being misallocated most definitely yes is it what many people want oh yes in other words boris johnson is a prime example of populism running riot example 2 as society ages the elderly will have a bigger and bigger say on the fiscal agenda most politicians are prepared to do irrational things just to buy votes if enough elderly want a spa in their local nursing home yes nursing home spas already exist i am sure we will see a few more of those pop up in the years to come rising populism will almost certainly lead to rising public debt levels as populists are masters at spending public money that has always been the case and particularly so when money has been cheap as public debt to gdp rises more and more capital will have to be deployed to servicing all that debt and capital used to service existing debt is by definition misallocated capital it is effectively a vicious circle that can only end in tears cheap money the root cause of misallocated capital capital being misallocated in large quantities is one of the most important reasons why gdp growth is as pedestrian as it currently is and the low cost of capital we are currently blessed with is the number one reason so much capital is misallocated at present when interest rates are low households buy property they can only afford because interest rates are extraordinarily low corporates buy back their own equity rather than making productivity enhancing investments as that makes earnings look much better than they actually are and governments increasingly under the control of populists spend public money on transfer payments rather than on things that would improve productivity for example by improving the failing infrastructure all of the above is classified as misallocated capital and the root cause is cheap money it is actually possible to calculate how much misallocated capital each country is saddled with but to do that i must introduce the wicksellian spread or wicksell spread named after the 19th century swedish economist knut wicksell wicksell argued that capitalism works best when the cost of capital to the average business is about 2 higher than nominal gdp growth and time has proven him right economists have since agreed to use the 10 year baa corporate bond yield as a proxy for the cost of capital to the average business and the wicksellian spread is the 10 year baa corporate bond yield less nominal gdp growth over the years it has proven to be one of the best probably the best indicator of banks willingness to lend hence it is a superb indicator of where we are in the credit cycle and of what can be expected of economic growth going forward i note that the wicksellian spread always climbs as we approach a recession in the 2001 02 recession it peaked at almost 6 in 2008 it exceeded 10 and it is currently nowhere those levels once you have established how big the wicksellian spread is you can calculate the cumulative amount of misallocated capital you do that by subtracting the wicksellian spread from 2 and then multiply that result by gdp for the quarter in question that result is again multiplied by debt to gdp using that methodology macrostrategy partnership my favourite research shop has found that the amount of misallocated capital in the us now exceeds the already elevated levels of 2007 08 exhibit 6 exhibit 6 cumulative misallocated capital in the us of gdp source the macrostrategy partnership llp bloomberg perhaps more surprising to you it certainly was to me even if it is bad enough as it is the us is nowhere near the top of the international league table in terms of misallocated capital out in front with so much misallocated capital that it adds up to no less than 77 of gdp is china all those bridges to nowhere in joint second place with 58 is australia and the big surprise germany the membership of a very unproductive monetary union has resulted in the very productive german economy having interest rates borrowing costs that are way too low for its own good which has led to a huge amount of capital being misallocated exhibit 7 how more precisely that will manifest itself down the road is difficult to say but there are certainly dark clouds gathering on the horizon in germany if knut wicksell s approach still works and macrostrategy partnership s calculation methodology can be validated a topic i will return to in a future absolute return letter exhibit 7 cumulative misallocated capital in germany of gdp source the macrostrategy partnership llp bloomberg finally let me share the uk picture with you at about 16 of gdp it is bad enough as it is particularly as it came from nothing only a handful of years ago but it is still better than elsewhere exhibit 8 exhibit 8 cumulative misallocated capital in the uk of gdp source the macrostrategy partnership llp bloomberg summing it all up let s wrap it all up a grotesque amount of misallocated capital capital that could and should be deployed to enhance productivity is an important reason why gdp growth is as pedestrian as it currently is and as you have just learned the emergence of populism doesn t make the problem any smaller if misallocations in the private sector are mostly funded by banks as they were in the years leading up to the great financial crisis they pose a systemic risk as we all learned some ten years ago these days most private sector misallocations are funded by either private credit or equity whether private or public that is bad enough but it doesn t pose the same level of systemic risk hence a repeat of 2008 is not as likely as many doomsayers claim as far as misallocations in the public sector are concerned a rather depressing picture unfolds the rising gap between rich and poor will almost certainly lead to more tailwind for populist parties and as we have learned from various incidents over the past few centuries populism often leads to authoritarianism if we want to protect our democracy it is therefore critical that we find ways to reverse the trendline expressed in exhibit 3 it is in that context you should think of brexit and the newly held elections for the european parliament where populist parties all over europe gained further momentum here in the uk more people than ever hold a job today and the unemployment rate is near all time lows average living standard are undoubtedly better than they were when i first moved here nearly 33 years ago it is almost impossible to find anything that s worse public transport maybe but it is hard to blame brussels for that even if nigel farage tries every now and then yet over 30 of the uk electorate voted for nigel farage and the brexit party in the euro election and there is an aura of self destruction hanging over the uk at the moment that leads me to finish this month s absolute return letter with a second quote from thomas l friedman s recent brexit article in the new york times what we re seeing is a country that s determined to commit economic suicide but can t even agree on how to kill itself it is an epic failure of political leadership niels c jensen 3 june 2019 investment theme declining spending powers of the middle classes article by

following the ratification of the african continental free trade agreement by the gambia on april 2nd and the deposit of instruments of ratification by the saharawi republic on april 29th the agreement which outlines the african continental free trade area afcfta came into force last thursday this paved the path for the agreement to enter its operational phase following a summit on july 7th the continental trade pact seeks to remove tariffs on 90 of the goods and services traded between the signatories to the agreement and gradually eliminate other non tariff barriers to trade on the african continent as of january this year 49 out of 55 african nations had signed the framework agreement on afcfta in effect creating the largest free trade area in the world in terms of participating countries since the creation of the world trade organisation wto in 1995 in so doing the signatories took the biggest step towards advancing intra african trade creating employment opportunities and fostering integration on a continent that was fragmented by colonial imperialists during the berlin conference between 1884 85 advertisement advertisement ijeoma nwogwugwu regrettably and despite the opportunity to get rid of the colonial legacy and unnatural borders that have divided the continent africa s largest economy by gdp and population nigeria which took over the processes leading to the afcfta agreement from egypt and even led the way at the ministerial level unexpectedly opted out of signing the agreement on march 21 2018 other countries yet to sign the agreement include benin republic and eritrea but it is nigeria s absence from the free trade bloc that has been the most conspicuous and set tongues wagging over the shortsightedness of the administration in not recognising the potential in the free trade treaty egged on by the manufacturers association of nigeria man and the confounded labour unions president muhammadu buhari said at the time of abstaining from the signing that nigeria would not do anything that would undermine local manufacturers and entrepreneurs the president of the nigeria labour congress nlc ayuba wabba went on to describe the afcfta as an extremely dangerous and radioactive neo liberal policy initiative that seeks to open our seaports airports and other businesses to unbridled foreign interference never before witnessed in the history of the country yet nigeria currently has the largest concentration of people living in extreme poverty in the world with the worst hit group being children and teens under the age of 15 worse still this number is growing definitely something has to give but all hope was not lost when shortly afterwards the nigerian government assured the african union the driving force behind afcfta that its non participation was a delay not a withdrawal and promised to sign the agreement soon it noted that more consultation was needed with local businesses in order to ensure private sector buy in to the agreement eventually an impact assessment report on afcfta as demanded by the president was presented to him by the former minister of industry trade and investment dr okey enelamah yet no word has been heard from the presidency on if nigeria will key into the continent s largest trade pact before it s too late it must be said however that the issue of afcfta did feature in the 2019 campaigns the presidential candidate of the opposition peoples democratic party alhaji atiku abubakar who is pro business did promise to make nigeria a member of the free trade bloc but with his loss at the polls and the country in transition mode concerns persist over the delay on nigeria s participation in the regional trade bloc much of the delay has been blamed on the perception among manufacturers and the unions that the free trade era will usher in massive dumping crippling of tenuous industries job losses loss of economic clout in the region and even the erosion of existing customs and border controls some have also argued that nigeria is not ripe for afcfta because of the prohibitive cost of doing business in the country brought on by inadequate power supply the infrastructure deficit rising insecurity and inaccessible seaports but my take on all the issues that have been raised by man and the labour unions is that they are grossly misplaced advertisement first and foremost by joining the trade pact we have nothing to fear about the loss of sovereign military or regional clout afcfta is a basic trade agreement it is neither a customs union nor a single market for nigeria to be prosperous we need to trade and invest with africans with the population of the african continent inching towards 2 2 billion people by 2050 and populations shrinking in the rest of the world this presents an opportunity and market for nigerian companies to capture market share right from the formation of the free trade area on the continent besides the only way to be prosperous is to produce higher value added goods and services in africa that will be bought by africans indeed just last friday the advisory partner with pricewaterhousecoopers pwc dr andre nevin rightly added on the breakfast show on arise tv the broadcast arm of the thisday media group that what the country needs is a manufacturing sector that is 10 15 times bigger than the manufacturing sector that we have today to be prosperous so it is not today s manufacturers that should be our focus what we should be concerned with is how to create the environment where we have a bigger and more buoyant manufacturing sector according to him the focus should shift from exporting raw materials to semi and fully processed goods with greater value added as raw materials only represent 5 10 of the value of finished goods so if we do not trade with africans and invest in africa we will be poor africa has suffered due to colonization and fractionalization of the continent afcfta presents an excellent opportunity to come out as one bloc which will have economic relations with other big countries and regional blocs with a potential market of 2 billion people others will be forced to listen and contend with us just as they do with the eu european union advertisement another case to be made for the african free trade bloc has to do with the trade between the 55 african union member states currently put at about 18 of total exports from the continent compared with 69 in europe 59 in asia and 31 in north america this is particularly important when considering that manufactured goods make up a much greater proportion of intra africa trade than trade with the rest of the world which is mainly focused on raw materials despite this and the fact that africa is the second most populous continent nigeria s main trading partners are all in europe asia and the americas it must be added that even the goods and services that make up 18 of intra african trade are transacted primarily through the informal sector what this implies is that the nigerian government has to bring the informal sector which accounts for 65 of the nigerian economy to the formal sector this can be achieved by eliminating the barriers that restrict the informal sector so that participants can transit to the formal sector avenues to do this include bringing down the exorbitant cost of entry by way of multiple taxation over regulation bureaucratic bottlenecks issuance of visa on arrival to citizens of afcfta member states as well as ease of access in and out of the seaports as it stands the seaports in the apapa area of lagos are completely inaccessible thus increasing the turnaround time that it takes for importers and exporters to move their goods in and out of the ports while those outside lagos with shallow draughts cannot be accessed by very large ships protectionist barriers as advocated by man and labour should also be discarded as isolationism will make it difficult for local businesses to scale abroad and thus make them less attractive for foreign direct investment whereas it is important to acknowledge the downside risk for local businesses and the nigerian economy what the government should be concerned with is how to address the problems caused by our infrastructure deficit in order to become competitive there is no reason for the government s inability to address these fundamental problems frontally by staying away from the afcfta we will simply be burying our heads in the sand by not addressing the fundamental issues that make nigeria uncompetitive ultimately this will impede economic growth advertisement moreover the threat posed by an integrated african market under the continental free trade agreement will force us to raise our competitiveness level if we can compete within the african continent surely we can compete globally as nevin advocated eventually market forces will defeat the case for market protection and the best way to be ahead of the curve is to prime your economy to be competitive one of the merits of afcfta is that it will force us to look inwards and learn how to swim against the oncoming storm another consideration for nigerian policy makers is for the redeployment of the humongous financial resources nigeria currently wastes on subsidising the cost of petrol that we consume just last week it was revealed that the country had spent n11 trillion on fuel subsidies over a six year period for a country recording tepid economic growth and whose citizens are sliding into poverty that is a monstrous travesty and is reflective of our penchant for wrong headed decisions like i have advocated for years in this column sensible countries subsidise production not consumption rather than spend trillions keeping the cost of petrol low it would make more sense to channel those trillions in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors by way of direct cash transfers grants or tax breaks in order to encourage production and keep prices of consumer goods low but to ensure that the policy is not abused and in order to guard against long term supply disruptions such subsidies to the productive sector should be limited to not more than five years which is sufficient time for local businesses to stand on their two feet unaided and for a focused government to keep building and improving on its infrastructure advertisement even concerns about dumping can be checkmated quite effectively through the deployment of blockchain technology at our ports of entry blockchain is an open incorruptible digital ledger that records commercial transactions between two parties efficiently in a verifiable and permanent way by design a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data with the introduction of blockchain the technology will enable customs officials to detect where goods are coming from and where it is determined that they are coming from outside the continent appropriate tariffs can be imposed for nevin the solution is to have a better view of the supply chain and make sure that african goods and services can trade freely and other goods cannot effectively the rules for consumer goods coming from afcfta member countries will be set by africa and another set of rules for goods coming from other continents with this in place concerns raised by manufacturers such as dangote cement that they find it more difficult to sell their goods to benin republic because of the tariffs and taxes imposed on their cement than it is for china to export cement to benin will be allayed this is no different from what obtains in the eurozone area today where there are no barriers to goods and services traded among members of the eu but barriers exist for non members of the union in reality this is one of the primary reasons britain s exit from the eu has been so contentious because the ease with which it moves its good and services will cease to exist once it leaves the eu then there is also the case to be made for entrepreneurship in nigeria about 49 of nigerians aged 18 64 are entrepreneurs almost three times the global average as evidenced in lagos alaba international market perhaps the biggest new venture incubator in the world most of these entrepreneurs work in retail the afcfta would give them more options for sourcing and consequently drive their costs down non retail entrepreneurs would also benefit from the ability to build more sophisticated value chains for improved operations advertisement advertisement

higher numbers on the vertical axis indicate stronger editorial support for government assistance to the financial system 1 figure 2 government policy responses and newspaper opinion in the us during

globe the chicago tribune relevant national newspaper editorials identified using boolean search terms that discussed government policy options during systemic banking crises since the 19th century similarly in the long run government policy responses in systemic banking crises have changed dramatically figure 3 summarises the results of our coding of thousands of government and central bank policy responses to 112 systemic banking crises in democracies since 1848 figure 3 average policy response index for new systemic banking crises and annual incidence of such crises in democracies 1848 2010 source chwieroth and walter 2019a 2019b notes the policy response index is the first principal component of eight policy indicators bagehot policy responses indicated by negative numbers in the top panel include liquidity assistance only to solvent banks closures of insolvent banks and losses imposed on their depositors bailout policy responses indicated by positive numbers include extended liquidity provision to potentially insolvent institutions public recapitalisations of banks bank nationalisations liquidity guarantees deposit freezes public sector bad banks publicly subsidised relief for bank debtors and deposit insurance schemes policy responses are coded in a three year time window after the end year of the crisis systemic banking crises are as defined in reinhart 2010 democracies are as defined by boix et al 2014 it reveals a general tendency in the pre 1939 era to avoid the extensive bailouts of large financial institutions that have become the norm since the 1970s our more detailed statistical results support the argument that mass financialised wealth has decisively shaped this trend this could be consistent with the popular argument that major financial institutions have increasingly captured policymakers and have become too big to fail johnson and kwak 2010 but the influence of large banks was high in many countries before wwii when bagehot policies generally prevailed our analysis points to how the rising middle class stake in financial stabilisation has facilitated the rising influence of large financial institutions in an earlier era when mass financialised wealth was far lower financial institutions and wealthy elites were often unable to convince elected governments to provide extensive bailouts during crises changing political consequences if governments are now generally doing what the anxious middle class wants have voters rewarded political incumbents not in practice the broad policy trends outlined above do not indicate that interventions are either timely or fair given the speed with which asset values can fall in financial crises anxious middle class wealth holders with great expectations want prompt government intervention to prevent large losses at least cost these expectations are often politically unrealistic in modern democracies extended arguments about the best policy and indecision in the early phases of crises often create large wealth losses and raise the eventual costs of bailouts these losses help to generate the political consensus necessary to undertake financial sector interventions us congressional delays in dealing with the distressed government sponsored enterprises fannie mae and freddie mac in summer 2007 and the chaos surrounding the bush administration s first troubled asset relief program tarp proposal in september 2008 generated sharp asset price declines these losses concentrated partisan minds in washington and so made it possible to pass tarp eventually but neither the bush nor the obama administration could obtain sufficient political support for debt relief to distressed homeowners in the slow burning mortgage crisis the result was a bailout perceived by many as bungled grossly unfair and highly costly that was unable to prevent the wealth losses average americans most feared policy delays are more likely in political systems exhibiting higher partisan polarisation and more institutional fragmentation veto points these conditions also encourage governments to intervene in ways that favour organised interests over diffuse groups such as mortgage holders mian et al 2014 we find that incumbent governments facing these conditions suffer higher rates of punishment after systemic banking crises only since 1970 figure 4 2 figure 4 systemic banking crises and changes in incumbent executive party vote share high and low veto environments 1872 2011 source henisz 2017 reinhart 2010 notes the results include 484 elections in 33 democracies and show the difference in the mean vote share change after systemic banking crises compared to financially tranquil times the henisz index captures political constraints on the chief executive based on the number of independent actors with policy vetoes and the distribution of political preferences across these actors in an earlier era free of great expectations elected governments could survive systemic banking crises even when they failed to intervene contrast the experience of incumbent us republicans after deep crises in 1907 and 2007 8 in 1908 the republican presidential successor candidate taft and congressional allies were easily re elected whereas in november 2008 the democrats swept all branches of government implications many reform proposals since 2008 seek to rule out future bailouts these include tighter bank regulation bailing in creditors and prohibiting or restricting government support to individual financial institutions in the us the dodd frank act and in the eu the bank recovery and resolution directive or brrd ben bernanke former chair of the federal reserve and tim geithner and hank paulson former chief secretaries of the treasury argue that these reforms will not prevent future crises and that restrictions on the capacity of governments and monetary authorities to intervene are therefore dangerous bernanke et al 2019 our analysis suggests a deeper political problem restricting crisis intervention capacity pushes against large structural trends in wealth accumulation financialisation and electoral politics and so lacks credibility to illustrate in 2017 italy s centre left government set aside the brand new brrd it cited a national interest loophole and avoided bailing in bondholders one third of whom were retail household investors and undertook the country s largest bank bailouts since the 1930s similar regulations are unlikely to be swept aside so easily in all cases instead in highly polarised and institutionally fragmented political systems new regulations restricting crisis interventions are likely to generate wealth destroying policy delays in the early phase of the next crisis bailouts of the largest financial institutions become politically unavoidable and if the financialised masses perceive themselves as unfairly treated political incumbents will suffer our argument also suggests the minskian financial cycle has deep political origins in the long run rising political support for bailouts has increased moral hazard it has raised the incentives for financial institutions to insure against failure by acquiring increasingly complex and large balance sheets that are deeply connected to middle class wealth finally our analysis helps to explain rising voter dissatisfaction with trends in public policymaking and more broadly in democratic processes foa and mounk 2016 it suggests a new possible policy trilemma by raising doubt about the ability of contemporary societies to sustain all three of democratic politics rising financialisation and financial stability over time mass wealth anxiety has been layered onto other sources of economic insecurity notably the transformations in the labour market associated with automation and technological change also associated with rising inequality in an era when political consensus is fleeting the long run prospects for liberal democracy

who knew health care could be so complicated trade wars are good and easy to win everybody gets a tax cut especially the middle class ignorance threads through president trump s utterances about economic policymaking its latest incarnation is in the form of one judy shelton whom the president has floated as a likely nominee for federal reserve board governor people know soap opera y things about trump s two failed nominees to fill vacant seats on the central bank s seven seat board stephen moore was a child and wife support deadbeat herman cain is an accused sexual harasser what most probably don t know is that those men and shelton who currently serves as the u s director of the european bank for reconstruction and development have supported a gold standard it s such a bad idea that moore found it necessary to lie about having ever endorsed it depressingly many americans might not hold shelton s support of the gold standard against her some years ago one poll found 44 of likely voters agreed or were at least open to the idea as a glass half full type i m thankful for the other 56 like the trump pronouncements i cited above the gold standard is an excursion into nuttiness under it paper money can be redeemed for a set amount of gold and the federal government can t circulate more money unless it increases its holdings of gold currently we operate on fiat money with our currency backed by the government s promise of its worth rather than a physical commodity the gold standard would be risible were it not also dangerous given that so many in the public aren t aware of how it could endanger their jobs if and when the next recession comes shelton s support for it is grounds for giving her the same hook that yanked moore and cain off the fed stage the clearest explanation of why returning to the gold standard would be one of the worst economic ideas in the world as the washington post headlined it turns on two questions why did the u s abandon the gold standard and why does shelton want to go back on it the gold standard is an excursion into nuttiness we effectively ditched the gold standard in 1933 president franklin roosevelt wanted to cut this anchor from the money supply so the federal reserve could inflate the currency as a stimulus against the great depression fdr signed legislation requiring the public to surrender most of its gold thereby boosting the government s holdings and then raised the set price of that gold the result was indeed a goosing of the moribund economy that result was hardly surprising an accidental version of fdr s policy had helped end the 1890s depression second worst only to that of the 1930s accidental because while the u s clung to the gold standard through that earlier depression worldwide gold strikes and more efficient refining techniques showered the economy with the precious metal inflating the money supply anyway only a monetary masochist wants to handcuff the government in battling capitalism s inevitable busts so why is shelton a goldbug in an article last year for the libertarian cato institute shelton argued that without tethering a currency to gold nations use monetary policy to deliberately manipulate their currencies to gain an advantage over trade partners in violation of free and fair trade the recent example was china which undervalued the yuan against the dollar to make chinese exports cheaper but note the past tense that was the recent example china s undervalued currency rose to more appropriate levels long before trump took the oath of office shelton is basing her position on old data and an argument past its expiration date shelton s support for is grounds for giving her the same hook that yanked moore and cain off the fed stage more damningly for her case she approvingly quoted trump s stated rationale for gold we d have a standard on which to base our money the president was channeling a screwball strain of thinking held by cranks from ron paul to ted cruz who argue that with fiat money government can print dollars 24 7 and ignite runaway inflation i m not making this up former republican house speaker paul ryan predicted the fed would debase the currency as it fired loose money at the great recession you know how that ended the inflation hysterical among us were proven wrong loose money made the slump less awful than it would have been without sparking out of control price hikes there s a graphic representation of the hysterics wrongness here although shelton s lone vote would not alter fed policy her elevation would give voice to a maverick perspective writes sebastian mallaby an international economics senior fellow at the council on foreign relations engaging in christian charity with the use of maverick harebrained is more like it
as governor his steady hand has seen off calls for cuts and hikes through 2017 and 2018 and no change proved ultimately the right course in those years says vimal gor head of fixed income at pendal group phil lowe and the rba board have done well to resist the calls for super low interest rates former reserve bank board member warwick mckibbin says looser policy is typically greeted with some enthusiasm from the country s corporate and political elite as well as the many more households with mortgages and the small businesses operating at the coal face of the economy but this time is different advertisement around the developed world many are questioning the effectiveness of extreme monetary policies adopted since the global financial crisis including zero rates and massive asset buying programs known as quantitative easing which have pushed long term bond yields towards zero and even in the case of germany below true to his word lowe has held rates steady despite the economy enduring the most prolonged stretch of below target underlying inflation in history the last time the rba s trimmed measure of inflation was above 2 per cent on a year on year basis was in the december quarter of 2015 after making a virtue of holding rates steady lowe is now challenged with selling lower rates despite a solid labour market and amid concerns that even easier policy will do little to stimulate growth or inflation even as it exacerbates concerns that it will delay or even reverse a much needed reduction in household debt levels it will be a tough sell not least because some question how much stimulus even easier monetary conditions will provide households already hold record levels of debt and as such will likely prove unwilling to borrow even more meanwhile fewer than one in 10 companies surveyed by nab cited interest rates as a major concern weighing on their businesses when the central bank puts on the brakes it has a big impact amp capital chief economist shane oliver says when it puts on the accelerator it s a question of whether it is pushing on a string advertisement leaving interest rates at already low levels and using the position of governor to push for other policy changes is the only responsible option that remains for the rba says mckibbin who is now director of the australian national university s centre for applied macroeconomic analysis we are still in the shadow of the gfc more than 10 years after the event tony morriss bank of america merrill lynch lowe and his board are in the unenviable position of being responsible for managing the short term economic cycle in an environment where the effectiveness of monetary policy is under a cloud and the risks of sparking or exacerbating financial stability risks remain real the bigger issue now is a concern that the longer qe policies remain in place the greater the distortions to activity and expectations and the harder it is to normalise over time bank of america merrill lynch rates strategist tony morriss says we are still in the shadow of the gfc more than 10 years after the event still few would doubt that if anybody is capable of negotiating the difficult road ahead it is lowe advertisement from my perspective he is the best economist of his generation in this country westpac s veteran chief economist bill evans says the quality of the economic debate has been lifted to new heights as phil has progressed though the bank evans says i find the insights he provides in his speeches quite remarkable through his time in the top job lowe has impressed with a steady demeanour and an ability to communicate complicated issues clearly not inflation nutters he has also worked hard to talk up the economy s prospects adopting a glass half full outlook for growth and inflation that some in the market at various times considered unrealistic advertisement lowe came into the job at what would soon prove to be the top of a property price boom which had been fuelled by a similarly impressive boom in household debt in his first parliamentary testimony after taking the top job lowe reiterated that he and his board were not inflation nutters and that considerations around financial stability risks would be front and centre through his governorship that panglossian view remained untempered despite evidence that the economy slowed dramatically through the september quarter of last year as recently as november the rba was upgrading its forecasts for economic growth in 2018 to 3 5 per cent all that changed this year when the us federal reserve abruptly abandoned its rate hike plans triggering a wave of easing around the world then australian economic data through the first months of 2019 showed inflation softened dramatically in the march quarter followed by news that unemployment lifted for two straight months the economy ultimately expanded by a much more modest 2 3 per cent in 2018 in a major speech on may 21 in brisbane lowe belatedly buckled and essentially pre announced policy easing saying the board at the june 4 meeting would consider the case for lower interest rates perhaps it s the level of rates being so low already that is part of the cautiousness vimal gor head of fixed income at pendal group advertisement the danger here is it s all too easy to point the finger and say he should have done this or that but i do wonder whether they got a little bit too optimistic through the latter half of last year and they missed this slowdown in this economy says amp s oliver the previous governors would likely have moved rates quicker as they tended to look six to 12 months ahead when setting policy pendal group s gor says former governors tended to rely on leading indicators such as the nab survey as a guide to monetary policy decisions rather than waiting for lagging indicators like employment to move the wrong way before cutting rates gor says perhaps it s the level of rates being so low already that is part of the cautiousness perhaps his well known work on monetary policy and asset bubbles meant he wanted to avoid cutting rates he says however it could be he is more cautious by nature if the latter it may also mean he is slower to hike in the years ahead if the australian economy recovers as much as australia has been the victim of global trends that have tended to suppress inflation and growth around the developed world in particular the deflationary impact of technological advances and the rise of china as a manufacturing giant a large element of our sub trend economic performance in recent years is home grown says richard yetsenga chief economist at anz advertisement i don t think the answer is for the central bank to do nothing richard yetsenga chief economist at anz australia has run on very strong credit growth for decades yetsenga says now we are learning what an economy without strong credit growth looks like and we don t like what we see i don t think the answer is for the central bank to do nothing yetsenga says the most dangerous thing for an economy with high debt levels is a persistent undershoot of inflation as it raises the risk of inflation expectations un anchored on the downside valid target nonetheless some question whether the bank s 2 3 per cent medium term inflation goal over time remains a valid target in an economy that as lowe has noted is less inflation prone than it once was with inflation averaging 1 7 per cent in his first three years and their own forecasts having it below 2 per cent for at least another year is the benchmark the correct one asks gor given they ve missed it for almost half a decade over time must be very long time what is ultimately important is that we deliver for the community low and stable inflation so that inflation is not something that you ll have to worry about when making your decisions about financial investment or investing in capital or employing people lowe said in a recent speech i think we re in that position at the moment i don t think most of you worry hopefully about inflation when making your decisions
wall street is no fan of tariff man the stock market stumbled friday to its first losing month of 2019 in may primarily due to president donald trump s decision to broadly wield his tariff powers first against china over trade and then against mexico over immigration during stocks month long slide investors wrestled with the potential impact that the u s s escalating trade war with china could have on corporate and economic growth friday s losses came after trump announced plans via twitter to impose tariffs on mexico in a bid to compel the nation s third biggest trading partner to crack down on migrants attempting to enter the u s the move shocked investors and spurred a broad sell off that sliced more than 350 points from the dow jones industrial average the selling left the benchmark s p 500 index 6 6 lower for the month and up 9 8 for the year so far clearly the markets were blindsided and completely caught off guard said cliff hodge director of investments for cornerstone wealth it was only a month ago that the s p 500 hit a record high and underlined its claim as the longest bull market for stocks on record at more than a decade long the market had climbed steadily through 2019 amid rising investor confidence that a deal with china was at hand and that the federal reserve would not tip the economy into recession by raising interest rates too aggressively but when the first weekend of may arrived trump s tweet threatening more tariffs on china upended months of calm in the market investors are now preparing for a much longer and messier resolution to the global trade war than they were expecting just a few weeks ago the trade conflicts have also clouded the global economic outlook with many economists now forecasting u s growth to weaken in the coming months that s likely to weigh on corporate profits this year what you had over the last few days really is an increase in global uncertainty and the economic data has been poor and weakening said tom martin senior portfolio manager with globalt investments with rising costs as a result of tariffs and rising uncertainty that s definitely going to have a damper on earnings the s p 500 index fell 36 80 points or 1 3 to 2 752 06 it s the first time the s p 500 has dropped for four straight weeks since autumn 2014 the dow lost 354 84 points or 1 4 to 24 815 04 the nasdaq slid 114 57 points or 1 5 to 7 453 15 the russell 2000 index of smaller companies gave up 20 04 points or 1 4 to 1 465 49 major stock indexes in europe also fell you had a market that was feeling as though president trump would want to do a deal so that the economy would not be hurt said martin and now the behavior is indicating that he will use tariffs to accomplish his goals and seems less concerned about the actual economic impact since the end of april investors have sought out safer investments like utilities and bonds technology stocks which led gains all year were among the month s biggest losers the technology heavy nasdaq shed 7 9 while technology companies within the s p 500 lost 8 9 utilities which have lagged the market fell only 1 3 in may making them among the month s best performers meanwhile real estate stocks posted a 0 9 gain the only winners this month the new tariffs on mexican goods shocked investors who were already nervous about a global trade war crimping economic growth the new front in the trade war hit automakers particularly hard many of them import vehicles from mexico general motors slid 4 3 friday while fiat chrysler dropped 4 8 ford motor lost 2 3 banks also declined as higher bond prices pushed yields lower the yield on the 10 year treasury note slid to 2 13 from 2 22 late thursday investors have been shifting money into bonds over

1 energy companies sank following another broad slide in oil prices occidental petroleum fell 4 1 and valero energy dropped 3 4 investors have been fleeing to safer holdings all month the shift to utilities and bonds quickened earlier in may after the u s and china broke off negotiations the u s then pushed more tariffs on chinese goods along with a ban on technology sales that prompted retaliatory tariffs from china and threats over other key resources while the u s economy grew at a solid 3 1 annual rate in the january march quarter many economists now think growth is likely to weaken in coming months they cite a range of threats facing the u s economy including escalating trade conflicts more cautious spending by consumers and businesses and a global economic slowdown on friday a report showed china s factory activity slowed in may as the trade war between washington and beijing escalated economists say china may be drawing up its own list of retaliatory targets among u s companies the worry is that a trade war fought on multiple fronts around the world will be a drag on corporate profits and on a u s economy that s been supported by a solid job market that worry pulled the yield on the 10 year treasury note to its lowest level since the summer of 2017 that s left long term treasury yields below some short term yields an unusual occurrence that many investors see as a warning sign of recession investors are also raising their bets that the federal reserve will need to cut interest rates later in 2019 to help the economy less than a year after it had been raising rates to get them closer to normal the fact that the president is willing to use tariffs as a weapon can really cause damage to business confidence hodge said you ve got to be wondering who s

china s position on the china us economic and trade consultations the state council information office of the people s republic of china june 2019 contents preface i economic and trade friction provoked by the us damages the interests of both countries and of the wider world ii the us has backtracked on its commitments in the china us economic and trade consultations iii china is committed to credible consultations based on equality and mutual benefit conclusion preface the china us commercial relationship serves as both the ballast and the propeller of the overall bilateral relationship at stake are the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the prosperity and stability of the world since the establishment of diplomatic relations between china and the us bilateral trade and economic relations have come a long way with expanding fields of cooperation at higher levels a mutually beneficial and win win relationship with strong complementarity and interlinked interests has been forged benefiting not only the two countries but also the entire world given the differences in stage of development and economic system it is inevitable that the two countries will experience differences and friction in their commercial cooperation the history of china us trade and economic relations has seen twists and turns and difficult situations by adopting a rational and cooperative attitude the two countries have managed to resolve previous conflicts bridge differences and render the bilateral commercial relationship more mature through dialogue and consultation since it took office in 2017 the new us administration has threatened additional tariffs and other measures and provoked frequent economic and trade friction with its major trading partners in response to the economic and trade friction unilaterally initiated by the us since march 2018 china has had to take forceful measures to defend the interests of the nation and its people at the same time committed to resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation china has engaged in multiple rounds of economic and trade consultations with the us in an effort to stabilize the bilateral commercial relationship china s position has been consistent and clear that cooperation serves the interests of the two countries that conflict can only hurt both and that cooperation is the only correct choice for both sides concerning their differences and frictions on the economic and trade front china is willing to work together with the us to find solutions and to reach a mutually beneficial and win win agreement however cooperation has to be based on principles there are bottom lines in consultations china will not compromise on major issues of principle china does not want a trade war but it is not afraid of one and it will fight one if necessary china s position on this has never changed to provide a comprehensive picture of the china us economic and trade consultations and present china s policy position on these consultations the chinese government hereby issues this white paper i economic and trade friction provoked by the us damages the interests of both countries and of the wider world trumpeting america first the current us administration has adopted a series of unilateral and protectionist measures regularly wielded tariffs as a big stick and coerced other countries into accepting its demands the us has initiated frequent investigations under the long unused sections 201 and 232 against its main trading partners causing disruption to the global economic and trade landscape specifically targeting china in august 2017 it launched a unilateral investigation under section 301 turning a blind eye to china s unremitting efforts and remarkable progress in protecting intellectual property and improving the business environment for foreign investors the us issued a myriad of slanted and negative observations and imposed additional tariffs and investment restrictions on china provoking economic and trade friction between the two countries turning a blind eye to the nature of the economic structure and the stage of development in china and the us as well as the reality of the international industrial division of labor the us insists that china s unfair and non reciprocal trade policies have created a trade deficit in bilateral commercial exchanges that constitutes being taken advantage of leading to unilateral imposition of additional tariffs on china in fact in today s globalized world the chinese and american economies are highly integrated and together constitute an entire industrial chain the two economies are bound in a union that is mutually beneficial and win win in nature equating a trade deficit to being taken advantage of is an error the restrictive measures the us has imposed on china are not good for china or the us and still worse for the rest of the world i the tariff measures the us imposed harm others and are of no benefit to itself the us administration has imposed additional tariffs on chinese goods exported to the us impeding two way trade and investment cooperation and undermining market confidence and economic stability in the two countries and globally the us tariff measures lead to a decrease in the volume of china s export to the us which fell by 9 7 percent year on year in the first four months of 20194 dropping for five months in a row in addition as china has to impose tariffs as a countermeasure to us tariff hikes us exports to china have dropped for eight months in a row5 the uncertainty brought by us china economic and trade friction made companies in both countries more hesitant about investing china s investment in the us continues to fall and the growth rate of us investment in china has also slowed down according to chinese statistics direct investment by chinese companies in the us was us 5 79 billion in 2018 down by 10 percent year on year6 in 2018 paid in us investment in china was us 2 69 billion7 up by only 1 5 percent year on year compared with an increase of 11 percent in 2017 with the outlook for china us trade friction unclear the wto has lowered its forecast for global trade growth in 2019 from 3 7 percent to 2 6 percent8 ii the trade war has not made america great again the tariff measures have not boosted american economic growth instead they have done serious harm to the us economy first the tariff measures have significantly increased production costs for us companies the chinese and us manufacturing sectors are highly dependent on each other many american manufacturers depend on china s raw materials and intermediary goods as it is hard for them to find good alternative suppliers in the short term they will have to bear the costs of the tariff hikes second the tariff measures lead to domestic price hikes in the us the import of value for money consumer goods from china is a key factor behind the long term low inflation in the us after the additional tariffs were imposed the final selling price of chinese products increased leaving american consumers effectively bearing some tariff costs according to research by the us national retail federation the 25 percent additional tariffs on furniture alone will cost the us consumer an additional us 4 6 billion per year9 third the tariff measures have an impact on us economic growth and people s livelihood a joint report by the us chamber of commerce and the rhodium group in march 2019 showed that under the impact of china us economic and trade friction us gdp in 2019 and the next four years could decrease by us 64 91 billion per year about 0 3 0 5 percent of total us gdp if the us imposes 25 percent tariffs on all chinese goods exported to the us us gdp will decrease by us 1 trillion in the next ten years cumulatively10 according to a research report in february 2019 by trade partnership an american think tank if the us imposes 25 percent additional tariffs on all imported chinese goods us gdp will decrease by 1 01 percent with 2 16 million job losses and an additional annual burden of us 2 294 on a family of four11 fourth the tariff measures lead to barriers to us exports to china the 2019 state export report published by the us china business council on may 1 2019 stated that in the ten years from 2009 to 2018 us exports to china supported over 1 1 million jobs the chinese market continues its importance to us economic growth forty eight states of the us have increased their goods exports to china during the last decade 44 of them by double digits while in 2018 when economic and trade friction worsened only 16 states increased their goods exports to china thirty four states exported fewer goods to china with 24 of them seeing a double digit decrease the midwestern agricultural states were hit particularly hard under tariff measures exports of american agricultural produce to china decreased by 33 1 percent year on year including a 50 percent drop in soybeans us businesses are worried that they might lose the chinese market which they have been cultivating for nearly 40 years iii us trade bullying harms the world economic globalization is a firmly established trend of the times beggar thy neighbor unilateralism and protectionism are unpopular the trade protectionist measures taken by the us go against the wto rules damage the multilateral trading system seriously disrupt global industrial chains and supply chains undermine market confidence and pose a serious challenge to global economic recovery and a major threat to the trend of economic globalization first the us measures are undermining the authority of the multilateral trading system the us has launched a series of unilateral investigations including those under sections 201 232 and 301 and imposed tariff measures these are a serious breach of the most fundamental and central wto rules including most favored nation treatment and tariff binding such unilateralist and protectionist actions have harmed the interests of china and other wto members more importantly they have undermined the authority of the wto and its dispute settlement system and exposed the multilateral trading system and international trade order to peril second the us measures threaten global economic growth with the shadow of the international financial crisis still lingering over the global economy the us government has escalated economic and trade friction and hiked additional tariffs provoking corresponding measures by the countries involved this disrupts global economic and trade order dampens world economic recovery and undermines the development of companies and the well being of people in all countries plunging the world economy into the recession trap global economic prospects released by the world bank in january 2019 revised its forecast for global economic growth down further to 2 9 percent citing continuous trade friction as a major downward risk12 the international monetary fund also marked down its projection of world economic growth for 2019 to 3 3 percent from the 2018 estimate of 3 6 percent in its world economic outlook report published in april 2019 suggesting that economic and trade friction could further depress global economic growth and weaken already anemic investment13 third the us moves disrupt global industrial and supply chains china and the us are both key links in global industrial and supply chains given the large volume of intermediary goods and components from other countries in chinese end products exported to the us us tariff hikes will hurt all the multinationals not least those from the us that work with chinese companies the tariff measures artificially drive up the costs of supply chains and undermine their stability and security as a result some businesses are forced to readjust their global supply chains at the expense of optimal resource allocation it is foreseeable that the latest us tariff hikes on china far from resolving issues will only make things worse for all sides china stands firm in opposition recently the us administration imposed long arm jurisdiction and sanctions against huawei and other chinese companies on the fabricated basis of national security to which china is also firmly opposed ii the us has backtracked on its commitments in the china us economic and trade consultations in response to the economic and trade friction started by the us china has been forced to take countermeasures as bilateral trade and investment relations took a hit for the well being of the chinese and american people and the economic development of the two countries both sides deemed it necessary to come to the negotiating table to seek a solution through consultation since they were launched in february 2018 the economic and trade consultations have come a long way with the two sides agreeing on most parts of the deal but the consultations have not been free of setbacks each of them being the result of a us breach of consensus and commitments and backtracking i the first us backtracking china had advocated resolving economic and trade friction through negotiation and consultation from the start in early february 2018 the us government expressed the wish that china send a high level delegation to the us to engage in economic and trade consultation demonstrating great goodwill and positive efforts china held several rounds of high level economic and trade consultations with the us characterized by in depth exchanges of views on trade imbalance among other major issues the two sides made substantial progress as they reached preliminary consensus on expanding china s imports of agricultural and energy products from the us however on march 22 2018 the us government unveiled the so called report on section 301 investigation of china falsely accusing china of ip theft and forced technology transfer and subsequently announced an additional tariff of 25 percent on us 50 billion of chinese exports to the us ii the second us backtracking taking a big picture view of the bilateral relationship the chinese government sent a working team again to the us to engage in genuine consultations on may 19 2018 china and the us issued a joint statement agreeing to refrain from fighting a trade war to continue high level communications and to actively seek solutions to respective economic and trade concerns the us publicly announced that it would suspend the plan for additional tariffs on chinese goods on may 29 2018 despite the opposition of its domestic business community and the general public the us administration tore up the consensus just ten days after the joint statement gratuitously criticizing china s economic system and trade policy while announcing the resumption of the tariff program starting from early july 2018 in three steps the us imposed additional tariffs of 25 percent on chinese exports worth us 50 billion and additional tariffs of 10 percent on us 200 billion of chinese exports which according to the us would be raised to 25 percent on january 1 2019 in addition the us threatened further tariffs on all remaining chinese exports leading to quick escalation of the economic and trade friction between the two countries in defense of its national dignity and its people s interests china had to respond in kind and raised tariffs on imports worth us 110 billion from the us iii the third us backtracking on november 1 2018 us president donald trump had a telephone conversation with chinese president xi jinping and proposed a summit meeting on december 1 the two presidents had a meeting on the margins of the g20 summit in argentina in accordance with their important consensus on economic and trade issues the two sides agreed to halt new additional tariffs for 90 days to allow for intensive talks geared toward the full elimination of all additional tariffs in the ensuing 90 days the working teams of china and the us held three rounds of high level consultations in beijing and washington d c reaching preliminary consensus on many matters of principle for the china us economic and trade deal on february 25 2019 the us announced the postponement of the additional tariffs scheduled for march 1 on us 200 billion of chinese exports to the us from late march to early april the working teams of the two countries held another three rounds of high level consultations and made substantial progress following numerous rounds of consultations the two countries had agreed on most of the issues regarding the remaining issues the chinese government urged mutual understanding and compromise for solutions to be found but the more the us government is offered the more it wants resorting to intimidation and coercion it persisted with exorbitant demands maintained the additional tariffs imposed since the friction began and insisted on including mandatory requirements concerning china s sovereign affairs in the deal which only served to delay the resolution of remaining differences on may 6 2019 the us irresponsibly accused china of backtracking on its position to shift the blame for the inconclusive talks onto china despite china s fierce opposition the us raised the additional tariffs on us 200 billion of chinese exports to the us from 10 percent to 25 percent which represented a serious setback to the economic and trade consultations on may 13 the us announced that it had launched procedures to slap additional tariffs on remaining chinese goods which are worth around us 300 billion these acts contradicted the agreement reached by the two presidents to ease friction through consultation and the expectations of people around the world casting a shadow over the bilateral economic and trade consultations and world economic growth in defense of its own interests china had to take tariff measures in response iv the us government should bear the sole and entire responsibility for this severe setback to the china us economic and trade consultations the us government accusation of chinese backtracking is totally groundless it is common practice for both sides to make new proposals for adjustments to the text and language in ongoing consultations in the previous more than ten rounds of negotiations the us administration kept changing its demands it is reckless to accuse china of backtracking while the talks are still under way historical experience has proved that any attempt to force a deal through tactics such as smears undermining and maximum pressure will only spoil the cooperative relationship historic opportunities will be missed a civilized country turns to forceful measures only when gentler approaches have failed after the us issued the new tariff threat the international community was widely concerned that china might cancel the consultation visit to the us it kept a close watch on the future direction of the china us trade negotiations bearing in mind the broader interests of trade and economic relations between the two countries china remained cool headed exercised restraint and sent a senior delegation to the us as agreed for the 11th round of economic and trade consultation from may 9 to 10 in doing so china demonstrated the greatest sincerity and a strong sense of responsibility for resolving trade disputes through dialogue in the following candid and constructive discussions the two sides agreed to manage differences and continue consultations china expressed strong opposition to the unilateral tariff increase by the us and stated its firm position that it would have to take necessary countermeasures china emphasized once again that trade deals must be based on equality and mutual benefit china will never compromise on major principles concerning china s core interests one prerequisite for a trade deal is that the us should remove all additional tariffs imposed on chinese exports and china s purchase of us goods should be realistic while ensuring that a proper balance in the text of the agreement is achieved to serve the common interests of both sides iii china is committed to credible consultations based on equality and mutual benefit the chinese government rejects the idea that threats of a trade war and continuous tariff hikes can ever help resolve trade and economic issues guided by a spirit of mutual respect equality and mutual benefit the two countries should push forward consultations based on good faith and credibility in a bid to address issues narrow differences expand common interests and jointly safeguard global economic stability and development i consultations should be based on mutual respect equality and mutual benefit it is only natural for china and the us the two largest economies and trading nations in the world to experience some differences over trade and economic cooperation what truly matters is how to enhance mutual trust promote cooperation and manage differences for the good of the common interests of the two countries and global trade order and in a strenuous effort to push forward the economic and trade consultations china remains committed to resolving issues through dialogue and consultation responding to us concerns with the greatest patience and sincerity properly handling differences while seeking common ground and overcoming obstacles to practical solutions during the consultations in accordance with the principle of mutual respect equality and mutual benefit china s only intention is to reach a mutually acceptable deal mutual respect means that each side should respect the other s social institutions economic system development path and rights core interests and major concerns it also means that one side should not cross the other s red lines the right to development cannot be sacrificed still the less can sovereignty be undermined as regards equality and mutual benefit we must ensure that the two sides in the consultations operate on an equal footing that results are mutually beneficial and that any final agreement is a win win one negotiations will get nowhere if one side tries to coerce the other or if only one party will benefit from the outcomes ii consultation involves working toward the same goal in good faith consultation calls for mutual understanding and genuine effort from both sides consultation is a process where the parties concerned seek consensus or make compromise through discussion many factors are at play in consultation it is perfectly normal during consultations for the parties to react differently to various changes at different stages based on their own interests the chinese government believes that economic and trade consultation is an effective way to solve issues none other than engagement with goodwill and a full understanding of the other s position can contribute to success otherwise it will be hard to reach a sustainable and enforceable deal as the parties will not find the ground for a long term and effective agreement good faith is the foundation of consultation the chinese government has engaged in these consultations with the us with the utmost credibility and the greatest sincerity attaching great importance to us concerns china has worked hard to look for effective paths and find ways to address differences the 11 rounds of high level consultations have made significant progress the outcomes of the consultations have not only served the interests of china but also those of the us as a result of both sides efforts to pull in the same direction china has kept its word during the consultations china has emphasized repeatedly that if a trade agreement is reached it will honor its commitments sincerely and faithfully iii china will not give ground on issues of principle every country has its own matters of principle during consultations a country s sovereignty and dignity must be respected and any agreement reached by the two sides must be based on equality and mutual benefit on major issues of principle china will not back down both china and the us should see and recognize their countries differences in national development and in stage of development and respect each other s development path and basic institutions while no one expects to resolve all issues through one single agreement it is necessary to ensure that any agreement will satisfy the needs of both sides and achieve a balance the recent us move to increase tariffs on chinese exports does not help to solve bilateral trade issues china strongly opposes this and has to respond to safeguard its lawful rights and interests china has been consistent and clear on its position that it hopes to resolve issues through dialogue rather than tariff measures china will act rationally in the interests of the chinese people the american people and all other peoples around the world however china will not bow under pressure and will rise to any challenge coming its way china is open to negotiation but will also fight to the end if needed iv no challenge will hold back china s development china s development may not be all smooth sailing difficulties or even perils are inevitable whatever the future might bring china is confident of meeting challenges head on turning risks into opportunities and opening new chapters china remains committed to its own cause no matter how the external environment changes the fundamental solution to economic and trade tensions is to grow stronger through reform and opening up with the enormous demand from the domestic market deeper supply side structural reform will comprehensively enhance the competitiveness of chinese products and companies we still have sufficient room for fiscal and monetary policy maneuvers china can maintain sound momentum for sustainable and healthy economic development and its economic prospects are bright china will continue to deepen reform and opening up china s door will not be closed it will only open even wider president xi jinping announced in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the second belt and road forum for international cooperation that china would adopt a number of major reform and opening up measures strengthen institutional and structural arrangements and promote opening up at a higher level measures to be taken include expanding market access for foreign investment in broader areas strengthening international cooperation on intellectual property protection increasing imports of goods and services implementing more effective international coordination on macro economic policies and putting more focus on the implementation of opening up policies a more open china will have more positive interactions with the world which in turn will advance the development and prosperity of both china and the world conclusion cooperation is the only correct choice for china and the us and win win is the only path to a better future as to where the china us economic and trade consultations are heading china is looking forward not backward disputes and conflicts on the trade and economic front at the end of the day need to be solved through dialogue and consultation striking a mutually beneficial and win win agreement serves the interests of china and the us and meets the expectations of the world it is hoped that the us can pull in the same direction with china and in a spirit of mutual respect equality and mutual benefit manage economic and trade differences strengthen trade and economic cooperation and jointly advance china us relations based on coordination cooperation and stability for the well being of both nations and the world 1 in february 2018 the global innovation policy center of the us chamber of commerce published the international intellectual property index 2018 noting that in 2018 china with a score of 19 08 rose to 25th among the 50

reading time 4 minutes canadians standard of living isn t growing as quickly as per capita gross domestic product gdp the reason our dollar has been declining against the currency of our biggest trading partner the united states while some of that is because the u s dollar has risen against most currencies around the world a lot of it is because of things we ve done to ourselves according to the economist canada s gdp per capita is about us 47 640 74 5 percent of that of our american cousins us 64 070 the last time the loonie traded at par with the u s dollar was feb 8 2013 it s tempting to blame the subsequent decline on the price of oil canada s major export commodity however while the price of oil as noted by the u s benchmark west texas intermediate hit 108 64 per barrel on sept 3 2013 it was only about 97 in february and the big drop in the price didn t start until later in june 2014 since then it s been a rocky slide for the loonie if oil isn t the only reason for the loonie s swoon then some other factors must be at play currency rates are set by supply and demand there are a number of constituents of demand exports of our products and services including tourism and other foreign visitors short term interest in our securities including money market and other interest rate sensitive securities and longer term interest in investing in our stocks bonds real estate mortgages loans businesses and other assets our current account including net exports and investment income has been negative since 2014 the capital account longer term flows and the exchange rate have to balance this we can increase demand for exports by developing new and attractive products and services lowering prices of existing ones or producing more and selling more into more markets unfortunately canada has not been good at this there are few entirely new products produced meanwhile oil sands bitumen and natural gas have been crowded out by shale production in the u s when the loonie was last at par we were selling all the oil and bitumen we could produce to the u s and at much higher prices those higher prices may never come back but the volumes sold could increase if we had pipeline capacity to the south east and west the loonie is also weak because there s little interest in investing in this country the biggest companies are in energy mining and banking with better alternatives in other countries those canadian sectors aren t attractive canadian mining companies have to compete for money with others around the world where getting projects approved permitted and developed to the commercial stage is faster and cheaper if not always as safe canadian investors are voting with their dollars according to global affairs canada from 2013 to 2017 foreign investment in canada grew by about 135 billion an average of about 27 billion per year whereas investment abroad by canada based investors grew by a whopping 343 billion or about 69 billion per year for 2018 the trend continued as foreign investment flowed in at 51 3 billion and canadian investment moved outward at 65 4 billion if capital accounts are negative and short term accounts are negative with lower interest rates here than in the united states and a negligible or often negative trade balance there will continue to be downward pressure on the loonie investors have to believe that rates of return if not robust now will become so in the near future and have a high probability of being sustainably high while canada s population growth is good at over one percent per year its productivity growth is meagre at less than one percent per person per annum from this increased profits and improved wages and living standards are nearly impossible in the mix add regulations that increase costs and lengthen times to start or expand businesses and projects increasing opposition from environmental and indigenous groups and landowners to resource industrial or real estate projects and high corporate taxes in comparison to the u s ultimately then it doesn t look like a canada u s currency parity is imminent but the federal government could improve canada s tax competitiveness with comparatively little harm to the federal deficit it needs to tax corporate income after capital expenditures as the u s does to boost capital spending and productivity it could also cut corporate tax rates by 0 5 percent a year for the next 10 years the gradual approach quebec has taken the business friendly governments now in power in most of canada s provinces could chime in making the total average rate in the nation even lower lower tax rates with more capital investment are crucial to increasing productivity wages and living standards reducing or eliminating the cost boosting carbon

unions representing delivery riders met at itf international transport federation house in london to plan how to take on exploitative gig economy employers the itf revealed on may 30th companies such as deliveroo foodora and uber eats have expanded rapidly over the last few years as to meet the increased demand for food delivery however this new sector has become notorious for its precarious pay and working conditions as well as for systematically miscategorising the employment status of riders as a way of shirking labour costs nevertheless workers are organising to fight back for fair treatment at the itf delivery riders forum representatives from the transport workers union australia btb ubt belgium 3f denmark filt cgil italy stf sweden and iwgb britain met to share their achievements to date and exchange strategies baker khundakji itf young transport workers officer said young workers are disproportionately affected by precarious employment and we need to turn our focus to new areas of the economy where exploitation is rife with delivery riders facing similar challenges across national borders the itf is committed to working together with unions to coordinate a transnational response to the gig economy every rider should be a unionrider meanwhile a central bank report has revealed that the so called gig economy is creating extreme financial hardship for millions of american workers even as the overall economy continues to expand according to the federal reserve s latest report on economic wellbeing in the us which was released on may 23 in 2018 workers who supported themselves through the gig economy struggled financially far more than the average person 58 per cent of full time gig workers said they would have a hard time coming up with 400 to cover an emergency bill compared to 38 per cent of people who don t work in the gig economy both numbers are worrying but the gap suggests that this informal economy is far more destabilising than silicon valley investors care to admit the fed said overall the financial experiences reported by the 11 000 adults surveyed in 2018 were largely positive and many families have experienced substantial gains since the survey began in 2013 in line with the nation s ongoing economic expansion when asked about their overall economic well being 75 per cent of us adults said they were doing okay or living comfortably up 12 percentage points from 2013 the survey also asked how they would pay for a hypothetical unexpected expense of 400 sixty one per cent said they would pay the expense with cash savings or a credit card paid off at the next statement 27 per cent would borrow or sell something and 12 per cent would not be able to cover it in 2013 only half of adults said they would pay with cash or its equivalent despite the improved finances of many adults the survey continued to detect areas of financial distress as well as persistent differences by race education level and in some cases geography nearly 8 in 10 whites reported doing at least okay financially compared to two thirds of blacks and hispanics a similar difference exists by education among those with a bachelor s degree or higher 87 per cent were doing at least okay compared with 64 per cent of those with a high school degree or less of those who live in middle and upper income neighbourhoods 8 in 10 reported overall satisfaction with their community compared to 6 in 10 of those living in low and moderate income neighbourhoods the fed report was based on the the board s sixth annual survey of household economics and decisionmaking shed which was conducted in october and november 2018 among the report s other key findings changes in family income from month to month remained a source of financial strain for some individuals three in 10 adults had family income that varied from month to month one in 10 struggled to pay their bills at some point in the prior year because of monthly changes in income financial support from family or friends to make ends meet was also common particularly among young adults most adults are working as much as they want to an indicator of full employment however some remained unemployed or underemployed one in 10 adults were not working and want to work though many were not actively looking for work four per cent of adults in the shed were not working wanted to work and had applied for a job in the prior 12 months similar to the official unemployment rate of 3 8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 two in 10 were working but said they wanted to work more blacks hispanics and those with less education are less likely to be satisfied with how much they were working not much is known about the gig workforce economists have a tough time measuring it because it can cover many different alternative work arrangements the fed survey defines it as people working as independent contractors or on temporary contracts with or without a mobile app involved that includes well known jobs like driving for uber and running errands through taskrabbit but also less obvious ones such as house cleaning child care and selling unwanted items for money the annual survey which polled 11 000 people in autumn 2018 found that the vast majority of gig workers don t make a living from it they just do it to make some extra money but five per cent of those surveyed said gig work is their main source of income that group was the most likely to report financial distress and the least likely to have health insurance paid time off unemployment benefits and basic labour protections financial hardship prompted thousands of uber and lyft drivers to go on strike in recent months in may as uber prepared to make its debut as a publicly traded company its drivers launched dozens of protests in the us and around the world demanding higher pay and recognition as employees not independent contractors that didn t happen but their collective outrage was a likely factor that sent company stock prices plunging and renewed scrutiny of the industry s role in fostering economic inequality the ride hailing giant s first day of trading on the new york stock exchange in may began with a drop from its initial public offering price of 45 and its stock closed down 7 6 per cent by the end of friday may 10th uber s market capitalisation accounting for stock options and restricted stock stood at 76 5 billion barely above the 76 billion that private investors pegged it at last august when tech startups in silicon valley began promoting their new app based personal services they often talked about how it would revolutionise work and empower people with the flexibility to set their own schedule for example the ride hailing service lyft entices potential drivers with the question do you want to be your own boss taskrabbit which allows people to hire a handyman or woman for individual tasks makes a similar pitch to workers find jobs you love at rates you choose make a schedule that fits your life the reality is far less rosy as gig economy startups struggled to turn a profit year after year it became clear that the profit model of these app based services was dependent on all the money they saved from skirting us labour laws uber is the perfect example by classifying drivers as independent contractors instead of employees uber doesn t need to pay certain taxes benefits overtime or minimum wages to tens of thousands of drivers as self employed contractors drivers don t have a legal right to form labour unions and negotiate contracts either uber drivers have spent more than six years fighting the company in court saying they ve been intentionally misclassified they argue that drivers should be considered employees because the company has so much control over their work day including strict rules on their vehicle conditions what rides they can take and which routes to take uber has fought back maintaining that drivers are not employees because they set their own schedules and provide their own cars in march uber settled the main court case with 13 600 uber drivers agreeing to pay them 20 million but without changing their status as independent contractors the other 350 000 drivers who were part of the initial class action lawsuit had signed mandatory arbitration agreements so a federal judge is requiring them to pursue their cases in a private forum where they are less likely to win their case in the meantime uber has been cutting driver pay rates in major cities to boost its bottom line to attract stockbrokers that infuriated drivers who were already struggling to make ends meet which the fed survey confirms they were particularly incensed by the fact that uber investors reaped millions even billions of dollars from the ipo because of their labour so on may 8th a loose network of ride hail drivers went on strike from san diego all the way to são paulo and sydney they urged drivers to boycott ride hailing applications for 24 hours and to instead spend the day picketing to demand more money they also called on cities to regulate ride hailing platforms the way new york city does new york city has set the standard for regulating ride hailing services the unrestricted growth of app based ride hailing companies put serious financial strain on new york city s taxi drivers making it harder for all drivers to compete and earn a decent living researchers say ride hail drivers in the us earn about 12 an hour after deducting car expenses and gasoline but pay rates vary wildly each day with uber sometimes taking more than 50 per cent of drivers earnings economists at the new school and the university of california berkeley published a report in july with some limited pay data and discovered something alarming driving for ride hailing apps in new york city is not really a part time gig for people who want to earn extra cash more than half of their drivers are ferrying around passengers on a full time basis and about half of them are supporting families with children on that income their earnings were so low that 40 per cent of drivers qualified for medicaid and about 18 per cent qualified for food stamps the new school report showed that the average hourly wage for app based drivers in new york was about 12 the app companies could easily absorb an increase in driver pay with a minimal fare adjustment and little inconvenience to passengers they wrote the report helped drivers persuade city officials in december to pass the nation s first minimum pay rate for drivers working with the four largest app based firms uber lyft juno and via starting in january ride hailing companies were required to start paying drivers around 17 22 per hour after expenses about 5 more per hour than the previous average of 11 90 per hour according to the independent drivers guild which represents about 70 000 uber lyft juno and via drivers in the city the new pay rate is calculated per ride but the guild expects it to give full time drivers an extra 9 600 a year lyft and juno are now suing the city arguing that the calculated rate favours uber but said they are using a different formula to meet the minimum hourly pay rate because uber and lyft drivers are considered independent contractors and not employees they are not subject to the city s minimum hourly wage which is now 15 per hour but the new rules essentially get around that loophole and ensure that drivers are earning at least the minimum wage with a few dollars extra to cover payroll taxes and some paid time off uber and lyft have pushed back against the pay increase saying it would hurt competition and discourage drivers from taking riders out of manhattan the current lawsuits suggest that lyft and juno are not done fighting it uber is not part of the lawsuits it s still too early to study the impact of the new laws but it gives other cities and states a blueprint for doing the same in california lawmakers have tried to pass laws giving independent contractor union rights they ve all failed in april the california supreme court delivered a win for gig workers making it harder for companies to classify them as independent contractors instead of employees as employees uber drivers would have the right to form a union and earn the minimum wage and maybe just
