weekly economic and financial commentary u s review home sales end 2018 on a low note data for durable goods orders and new home sales during the month of december were postponed as a result of the continued partial government shutdown existing home sales fell 6 4 to a 4 99 million unit pace the slowest since november 2015 initial unemployment claims for the week ending january 19 fell to 199 000 the lowest level since 1969 a 0 1 decline registered in the december leading economic index lei was mostly the result of a drag from financial market volatility home sales end 2018 on a low note the partial federal government shutdown continued this week the doors of many agencies that receive federal funding have now been closed for 35 days the longest period in the nation s history as a consequence reports for durable goods orders and new home sales during december were postponed while the census bureau was unable to provide data on new home sales the national association of realtors nar revealed that existing home sales faltered during december resales of singlefamily homes and co ops condos fell 6 4 to a 4 99 million unit pace the slowest since november 2015 the magnitude of the drop exceeded expectations but a slowdown in sales was largely anticipated pending home sales which measure contract signings and lead closings by four to eight weeks weakened considerably in the second half of the year alongside noticeably higher mortgage rates december s decline caps a year in which the housing market lost a great deal of momentum sales trended lower for much of the year averaging a 5 34 million unit pace in 2018 3 6 lower than the average 5 53 million unit pace posted in 2017 that being said december s report offered a few bright spots that point to housing market conditions improving in 2019 inventories of homes on the market grew 6 2 year over year during december the fifth consecutive increase extremely low inventory levels have been a driving force behind the rapid home price appreciation and an impediment to overall sales as inventory levels improve home prices should continue to ease the nar reported that the median existing single family home price moderated 2 9 year over year the slowest rise since 2012 more modest home price appreciation amid higher mortgage rates should help support a gradual improvement in home sales moving forward while we expect mortgage rates to trend upward over the course of the year rates on 30 year conventional loans fell in december which led to a noticeable increase in mortgage applications in early january further evidence that home buying activity is set to improve a solid labor market should also be supportive of housing and so far there has been little evidence of any weakening on the horizon initial unemployment claims for the week ending january 19 fell to 199 000 the lowest level since 1969 while initial claims had ticked slightly higher toward the end of 2018 claims have fallen in each week so far in january initial claims for federal civilian workers which are reported separately and lag by one week increased to 25 419 which was to be expected given the roughly 800 000 furloughed federal workers meanwhile the lei continues to point to generally favorable economic conditions the 0 1 decline registered in december was mostly the result of financial market volatility which dragged down the overall index a note of caution about reading too much into this report due to the lack of new data arising from the shutdown manufacturers new orders and building permits also had to be estimated by the conference board u s outlook fomc meeting wednesday it is widely expected that the fomc will leave its policy rate and balance sheet program unchanged at its january meeting we expect the statement and chair s press conference now held after every meeting to reflect a more cautious and uncertain outlook however the committee is likely to acknowledge signs of slowing growth based on available data a nod to the fact that the partial government shutdown an added source of uncertainty has delayed the release of some key data including the first look at q4 gdp originally due wednesday as well given the more conservative outlook the statement may also remove the notion that further gradual increases in the fed funds rate may be necessary overall we believe the fomc will remain constructive on the u s outlook but the more dovish tone would be supportive of our expectations for the fomc to pause further rate hikes until late in the second quarter previous 2 25 2 50 wells fargo 2 25 2 50 consensus 2 25 2 50 employment friday the exceptionally strong pace of hiring in december is unlikely to have persisted and we expect hiring to slow below its recent trend government workers affected by the shutdown will still be counted as employed since back pay has already been approved while the impact on contractors will probably be minimal since the survey was early in the shutdown yet other data including job openings hiring plans and pmi employment indexes suggest more moderate hiring recently furloughed workers will be counted as unemployed but after december s jump and the release of annual adjustments to the household survey we expect the jobless rate to tick down to 3 8 another strong print for payrolls and average hourly earnings would keep the fomc on course to eventually raise rates twice more this year a significant downside miss however would add support to the view that the fomc needs to hold off on further rate increases longer than the committee currently anticipates previous 312 000 wells fargo 155 000 consensus 160 000 ism manufacturing friday the ism index tumbled 5 2 points in december but the drop left the index well within expansion territory at 54 1 the two year low puts the ism more in line with hard data on the factory sector which had been pointing to softer factory sector performance for some months now with global growth slowing and continued uncertainty surrounding trade the manufacturing environment has deteriorated over the past year but we expect the ism index will be little changed in january the markit and regional pmis released thus far for january were on balance little changed from their december readings the ism will take on increased importance given hard data on factory orders is not being published due to the shutdown another significant miss to the downside would suggest that the global environment is weighing more heavily on growth and support a more cautious policy stance by the fomc previous 54 1 wells fargo 54 0 consensus 54 3 global review economic growth cooling off in europe china the chinese economy grew 6 4 in q4 2018 and 6 6 for the year the slowest pace since 1990 as the country continues to battle structural and trade related economic challenges the european central bank ecb left monetary policy unchanged at its meeting this week but acknowledged that the downside risks to growth are growing the bank of japan boj also left monetary policy unchanged while upgrading its growth forecasts and downgrading its inflation forecasts once again reaching and sustaining the 2 inflation target seems a ways off economic growth cooling off in europe china chinese gdp for q4 2018 kicked off the international data this week the print was largely in line with consensus real gdp growth was 6 4 year over year down from 6 5 in q3 see chart on front page for the year the chinese economy grew 6 6 the slowest pace since 1990 chinese economic growth was slowing well before the trade dispute with the united states that accelerated in 2018 workingage population growth has slowed significantly investment spending growth has been on a secular decline for years top chart and the rapid pace of technological adaption has abated as is customary for emerging markets at this point in their development the escalation of trade tensions and the enactment of several rounds of tariffs has likely contributed to a sharper slowdown chinese policymakers have done their best to combat this slowdown via monetary and fiscal stimulus but without a clean resolution to the trade situation a more marked slowdown is likely in store in 2019 at present our forecast for real gdp growth in china in 2019 is 6 2 in europe the european central bank ecb left monetary policy unchanged against a backdrop of economic growth that has weakened considerably over the past few quarters real gdp growth in q4 2018 appears to have been just as weak as it was in q3 see the global outlook section and the topic of the week and the first couple data points for q1 have not been much better the flash purchasing manager indices for january was weaker and are now teetering on the edge between expansion and contraction middle chart amid these signs the ecb acknowledged that the economic risks in the eurozone are tilted to the downside forward guidance from the ecb had already signaled that rates would be on hold through at least the summer so for now the central bank seems content to monitor the data for additional signs of sustained weakness the bank of japan boj also met this past week and made no major changes to its still extraordinarily easy monetary policy regime the central bank s median growth projection actually ticked up modestly for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 but its inflation forecasts came down for those two years a phenomenon that has become all too familiar for boj policymakers once again reaching and sustaining the 2 inflation target seems a ways off developments in overseas economies and the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in october 2019 were two of the primary risks to economic activity identified by the boj one encouraging development in the japanese economy has been the robust pickup in the employment population ratio since the start of 2013 the employment population ratio for all persons aged 15 64 has risen more than 6 percentage points bottom chart this has been especially true for females the female employment rate for the same age cohort has risen more than 8 percentage points over the same period for a country that has very well documented demographic challenges a larger segment of the population working is a welcome development at least as it relates to things like fiscal sustainability and faster aggregate economic growth global outlook chinese pmis wednesday saturday both the official and caixin purchasing manager indices for china are released next week and will offer an initial look at economic activity in china to start the year as was discussed in the international review economic growth continued to slow in china in q4 and the official manufacturing pmi was 49 4 in december its first close below 50 since july 2016 in that report the new orders component also slid below 50 and new export orders continued to fall declining to 46 6 the privately produced caixin manufacturing pmi did not fare much better also falling below 50 to 49 7 the lowest reading since may 2017 some stabilization in the pmis would be encouraging though the approaching chinese new year could cause some near term noise in the data a continued decline however would signal the downside risks are rising for china ahead of the key march 1 trade deadline with the united states previous 49 4 consensus 49 3 manufacturing mexico gdp wednesday real gdp growth surprised to the upside in mexico in q3 rising 2 5 year 0ver year roughly the same pace as the previous two quarters the fourth quarter in mexico was a volatile one with a depreciating peso a decelerating economy according to the central bank s projections and two rate hikes from monetary policymakers lower oil prices will likely do little to help spur the investment needed to revitalize mexican oil production and the stagnation in u s vehicle sales represents another challenge to the mexican economy the trade uncertainty from nafta renegotiation has receded somewhat now that the usmca has been signed but the congresses of the countries must still approve the deal with the u s government currently experiencing a historically long shutdown the prospects for passage have probably not improved of late we look for real gdp growth of 2 3 in mexico in 2019 as fiscal stimulus provides a boost before growth cools to 1 9 in 2020 previous 2 5 consensus 2 0 year over year eurozone gdp thursday real gdp growth in the eurozone clearly slowed in q3 2018 but some of the slowdown was likely due to temporary factors such as a one off decline in auto purchases related to some regulatory changes since then however the data have continued to show signs of weakness as mentioned in the global review the pmis have continued to soften and industrial production in november posted the sharpest year over year decline since 2012 with economic growth in q4 likely slowing further from the 1 6 year over year pace registered in q3 any further deterioration as q1 2019 data start to become available would be an ominous sign the first eurozone cpi print of 2019 is also released next friday though gdp growth has weakened core inflation has held steady hovering within 0 1 percentage point of 1 0 every month since may with growth weakening any sign that core inflation is slowing would be yet another hurdle to the first rate hike from the ecb previous 0 2 consensus 0 2 quarter over quarter not annualized point of view interest rate watch look to the ism for clues on the fed the financial markets are still priced as if the fed has completed raising interest rates for this cycle and currently expect the next fed move to be a cut in short term rates early next year official pronouncements by fed officials and the most recent dot plot of expectations for the federal funds rate for the next few years remain consistent with two more hikes this year before the fed shifts directions amid slower growth and the upcoming presidential election in 2020 that remains our forecast as well with hikes penciled in for june and december next week s fomc meeting will probably not provide a definitive answer as to whether or not the fed is finished hiking rates this cycle it will likely reinforce the notion that it has become more patient and data dependent in setting policy than simply striving to return interest rates to a neutral level with data more scarce amid the government shutdown the fed will scrutinize what data is still being reported for important clues on what is being missed momentum has clearly slowed in recent weeks and many forecasters have scaled back their expectations for first quarter real gdp growth the loss of momentum is most evident in the factory sector and was clearly picked up by the ism manufacturing survey which plummeted 5 2 points in december to 54 1 marking its largest one month drop since may 2011 most regional manufacturing indices also weakened that month data for january will be reported on friday and will likely show a modest drop data from regional fed surveys were mixed this past month the fed has a long history of closely scrutinizing the ism manufacturing survey while the factory sector accounts for a fairly small proportion of gdp it still provides the bulk of the cyclical impulse to the broader economy the fed has rarely raised the federal funds rate when the ism index is declining sharply and has typically halted tightening cycles once the index fell below the key 50 break even level another big drop in the ism would likely cause the fed to take a longer pause and if the index falls definitively below 50 it will likely remain on hold until the factory sector rebounds in a meaningful and sustainable way credit market insights a watchful eye on consumer credit since the fomc s last policy meeting in december market implied probabilities of a rate hike this year have tumbled this happened alongside a sharp sell off in the stock market in december and heighted fears that a recession was on the horizon even with a more recent dovish tone from the fomc worries of a downturn have not completely subsided as the partial government shutdown has stretched into its fifth week and continues to cloud analysts visibility of economic developments after hiking rates 100 bps in 2018 it is widely expected that the fomc will leave its policy rate unchanged at its meeting next week see the u s outlook section for more detail since the fomc began raising rates in late 2015 the cost of carrying consumer debt has steadily increased interest rates on credit cards are now at their highest rate since 2000 with only minimal increases in income growth over this cycle could the increased cost of debt become a concern among households total household debt as a percent of gdp remains relatively low while the household financial obligations ratio remains near lows not seen since the 1980s this should allow households to withstand increased borrowing costs elevated saving rates should also add cushion to consumer finances but with our assumption that the fomc will eventually resume its gradual pace of tightening with two more rate hikes this year the cost of debt will likely continue to rise and could pressure consumers topic of the week is the eurozone economy close to recession the recent slowdown in eurozone economic growth has sparked fears that the bloc may be approaching or already in a recession forecasting recessions is a notoriously difficult task and even defining what marks a recession is not always straightforward in a recent special report we identify a couple simple rules of thumb that may allow readers to monitor the economic data for signs of an imminent recession in the eurozone while some recent indicator readings are worrying we do not believe the data at present suggest a eurozone recession is either imminent or inevitable in our view gdp growth would need to range between 0 1 to 0 2 or slower per quarter for three or more quarters and the composite pmi would have to remain at or below the 51 0 level for several months before we would become seriously concerned that the eurozone is either imminently approaching or in economic recession the historical results of using this approach are illustrated in the table to the right what then are the implications for the current episode like ecb president draghi we do not yet believe these important economic indicators are signaling an approaching eurozone recession gdp growth has averaged 0 33 per quarter over the past three quarters a pace that has been consistent with the eurozone avoiding recession in the past q3 2004 to q1 2005 and q2 2001 to q1 2002 the january pmi however dipped just below 51 to 50 7 though this was admittedly the preliminary flash estimate pulling it all together it is clear to us that the eurozone economy has slowed materially over the past year the data do not yet indicate to us that a recession is inevitable or imminent but both the level readings and the directional trends suggest heightened monitoring of the data is warranted if q4 2018 real gdp growth is especially weak next week a q1 2019 rebound will become even more important to stave off a recession and keep the ecb on track to tighten rather than ease as its next move
open this photo in gallery an economic slowdown disinflation and switch to a consumer and service based economy in china clearly benefits canada as we import cheaper products and export added value ones such as technology china stringer network daniel lacalle is an economist whose books include life in the financial markets the energy world is flat and escape from the central bank trap he is currently working on his next book freedom or equality the key to prosperity through social capitalism in recent months analysts and market commentators have voiced concerns about a slowdown in the chinese economy the general view is that growth significantly below the current level of 6 per cent to 6 5 per cent would be bad for the global economy posing the risk of modest deflation or even becoming a drag on economies around the world legitimate concerns it s important to note though that the slowdown in china has nothing to do with the trade war headlines it was a reality before trade negotiations with the trump administration became so aggressive china s economic growth pattern is changing rapidly and for the better the country s highly indebted model of growth at any cost and its dependence on commodity imports were ultimately unsustainable the world does not need another financial crisis triggered by excessive debt it is not an emerging economy any more and as such we should not expect the gross domestic product gdp increases of the past years the new economy is more consumer and service based as opposed to one based on heavily industrialized capital and commodities such an economic model driven by dynamic and innovative companies not by state owned inefficient enterprises cannot offset in gdp terms the massive infrastructure and debt fuelled investments of the past decade china now faces three challenges excessive total debt estimated at 270 per cent of gdp overcapacity and significant financial imbalances in a large group of state owned enterprises that generate returns below the cost of capital addressing those issues and incentivizing the technology and services sectors means a less energy intensive gdp a lower rate of growth and a gradual lengthy transition to a more open economy that ends its capital controls a lower growth rate means more sustainable development as china s energy intensity is expected to halve in the next 20 years that is good news for the world for its resources and for the climate it also means lower inflation for the rest of the world china exports disinflation to other countries in two ways by selling cheaper products and because all the capacity installed around the world to supply the allegedly endless needs of china starts to become unnecessary these two factors have been quite evident in the past three years as we saw the effects of the 2008 chinese stimulus which created larger imbalances and excess capacity there is also a monetary factor involved the significant imbalances built into the chinese economy throughout the past two decades exacerbated by that misguided stimulus may require a significant devaluation of the yuan beijing understands that the outcome of excess capacity and debt traditionally ends with a financial crisis and a rise in unemployment in order to avoid this painful outcome it can rebalance the economy by devaluing the yuan and allowing the currency to float of course this would also have negative effects but it may be perceived as easier than taking hard measures to reduce leverage however imbalances of such magnitude are not addressed solely with monetary policy as we have seen since the financial crisis low interest rates liquidity injections and beggar thy neighbour currency wars have only increased global debt to all time highs devaluation is rarely a tool for improvement or an easy way to address competitiveness challenges it just perpetuates the inefficiencies of the economy as it transfers wealth from the savers and productive sectors to the less productive and more indebted parts of the economy in effect a subsidy for the unproductive at the expense of responsible citizens in the case of china it is not a competitive devaluation that is required but a free floating currency china cannot aspire to be a global leader with a widely used currency and also maintain capital controls china has the second largest economy in the world but the yuan is used in less than 5 per cent of global transactions according to the bank of international settlements that is why china needs to let its currency achieve a market value relative to its other trading currencies that is closer to reality otherwise its economy s dependence on the u s dollar and risky commodity backed loans will create a bigger problem none of these issues was new before the trade war but if anything the tension between the united states and china has highlighted the severity of these problems and has driven beijing to boost its promotion of innovation and debt control and speed up the transition phase to the new economy how does this benefit canada one of the things that often infuriates me when i analyze the canadian economy is reading so many reports that categorize canada as a commodity driven economy dependent on chinese growth along with australia our country seems to be incorrectly perceived solely as a commodity proxy canada imports much more from china than its exports to the asian giant an economic slowdown disinflation and switch to a consumer and service based economy in china clearly benefits canada as we import cheaper products and export added value ones such as technology china s growth slowdown will not spell the end to its need for oil and natural gas it will just moderate its requirements additionally it will need cleaner energy this is a particularly positive turn for the canadian natural gas sector and its liquefied natural gas segment it is also a fabulous opportunity for renewables and infrastructure developers which can compete with china through technology value and service canadian technology and expertise in developing non conventional sources of energy are highly likely to be in demand in the new china co operation will be key china will need a strong partner that supports its transition to a modern thriving economy for canada the chinese market simply cannot be ignored as a platform for growth in services technology infrastructure and manufactured goods the new china is likely to demand much higher quality goods and services strong brands and superb customer experiences even in a slower growth economy we cannot underestimate the opportunities presented by a thriving chinese middle class what are the biggest challenges the depreciation of the yuan disinflationary pressures and slower growth should not be an issue if canadian companies do not fall into the trap of requiring high inflation and extremely high growth rates to sustain their business with china working capital kills more companies than any other risk and the energy industry in canada learned quickly and painfully how to adapt to a lower for longer oil price environment oil and gas producers managed to survive and deliver halving their break even oil price when most analysts believed the industry would not survive that same principle should be applied to the opportunities in the new china the only businesses that should be worried about the chinese slowdown are those that are too leveraged to adapt to a normalization of china s growth pattern sectors that adapt to a changing world and see that china s future is brighter without its massive imbalances will be the winners china slowing down its growth can easily mean canada accelerating its own it just requires a different perspective less excess more value
according to public opinion polls 20 years after its introduction the euro is highly popular with 64 of eurozone citizens supporting the common currency this offers hope that if the eurozone s leaders can learn from past mistakes the monetary union will survive and even thrive in the future cambridge since its introduction two decades ago the euro has faced serious challenges so far it has survived intact yet on the common currency s 20th anniversary it is worth identifying problems that have been encountered and one hopes to learn from past mistakes a first critical problem was inherent in the application of a common currency to a large and varied set of countries they did not meet the criteria for an optimum currency area as american economists pointed out in particular the members lacked cyclical synchronization it is much harder to go without monetary independence if your economy s needs are not aligned with those of the other countries in the union in 2004 2006 for example ireland needed a tighter monetary policy than the european central bank was prepared to set given a housing bubble and economic overheating but it had ceded the authority to revalue its currency or raise interest rates likewise in 2009 2013 when ireland needed an easier monetary policy than the ecb s given a steep recession it was unable to devalue its currency print money or lower its interest rate a second mistake was that some peripheral eurozone countries maintained large current account deficits during the euro s first decade at the time these countries large net capital inflows were viewed as a sign of efficiency improving financial integration in retrospect the imbalances attributable in part to a rise in the periphery s unit labor costs relative to germany s were less benign many countries most notably greece also maintained large budget deficits and high debt levels they confirmed longstanding fears among wealthier members especially germany that they would end up being forced to bail out their profligate partners for which the expectation of being rescued amounted to a perverse incentive to their credit the architects of europe s monetary union recognized moral hazard as a central vulnerability and tried to address it by requiring that countries cap their budget deficits at 3 of gdp and including a no bail out clause in the maastricht treaty but the fiscal rules proved un enforceable virtually all eurozone members including germany soon breached the 3 deficit ceiling and though governments repeatedly claimed that fiscal targets would be achieved in the future those expectations were based on overly optimistic growth forecasts subscribe to ps digital subscribe to ps digital access every new ps commentary our entire on point suite of subscriber exclusive content including longer reads insider interviews big picture big question and say more and the full ps archive subscribe now it did not help that with the creation of the eurozone highly indebted periphery governments were suddenly able to borrow at virtually the same interest rates as germany even within the united states indebted states like illinois must pay an interest rate premium relative to other states the eurozone s failure to shift more fiscal authority to the supra national level was repeated in the area of banking regulation european economists had warned that pan eurozone banking regulation is essential to the common currency s long term sustainability only to be ignored to be fair these problems cannot really be called mistakes by eurozone leaders as any attempt to address them would have faced overwhelming political opposition in other ways however the eurozone s leaders really did shoot themselves in the foot for example the ecb mistakenly raised interest rates in july 2008 and again twice in 2011 despite the global recession moreover when the greek crisis erupted at the beginning of 2010 european leaders did not respond effectively instead they delayed sending greece to the international monetary fund and writing down greek debt even though the debt to gdp ratio was clearly on an unsustainable path even with stringent fiscal austerity in fact the push for austerity after 2009 backfired spectacularly as it caused incomes in periphery countries to fall far more than the european commission the ecb and the imf had anticipated even leaving aside the economic cost of the recession and the political cost of the resulting populist anger fiscal austerity did not achieve its goal of putting countries like greece onto sustainable debt paths on the contrary the fall in gdp was larger than any fall in debt causing debt to gdp ratios to rise even faster the implementation of fiscal austerity during a time of crisis together with the high spending of the eurozone s early years constitutes pro cyclical fiscal policy indeed greek fiscal policy is among the world s most pro cyclical that does not put the eurozone on a strong footing to weather future crises this is not to suggest that the euro has not had its successes for starters the transition from 11 individual currencies to the euro went very smoothly the european currency crises of 1992 and 1993 as well as more recent chaotic demonetizations elsewhere show that a successful transition was far from guaranteed a second early success was that by virtually all measures of international use the euro instantly became the world s second global reserve currency moreover the desire to be admitted to the club led to favorable reforms in many aspiring member countries particularly the central and eastern european countries that later joined the european union more recent entries on the success side of the ledger include the progress of some periphery countries particularly spain reducing their previously uncompetitive unit labor costs ecb president mario draghi deserves top marks for balancing germany s demand for fiscal discipline and the mediterranean need for accommodation his july 2012 declaration that the ecb would do whatever it takes to preserve the euro calmed markets a vital turning point in the crisis perhaps most important public opinion polls indicate that in recent years the euro has achieved strong popular support with 64 of citizens supporting the common currency in november 2018 this offers hope that if the eurozone s leaders can learn from past mistakes the monetary union will survive and even thrive in the future
dollar ended last week as the weakest one after deep selloff before weekly close a whole lot of events are scheduled ahead to keep the greenback busy those include fomc rate decision us china trade talk non farm payrolls also the partial government shutdown has finally ended temporarily and we ll have more economic data for gauging the economy of the us australian dollar ended as the second weakest but it has already pared back much losses after friday s rebound yen followed as the third weakest sterling ended as the strongest one and maintained strengthen towards the end it s boosted by receding chance of no deal brexit the debate and vote on amendments in the commons on tuesday will likely provide a more concrete path forward regarding brexit new zealand dollar was the second strongest after solid cpi lowered chance of an rbnz cut euro was surprisingly resilient and survived a batch of weak data as well as dovish ecb the common currency will face tests from gdp and cpi this week fomc trade war nfp and reopened government to keep dollar busy dollar performed not too badly for most part of the week until it suffered heavy selloff on friday the wsj reported fed is considering to stop shrinking it s massive balance sheet earlier that is the eventual size of the portfolio of treasury securities could be larger than originally expected this is seen as move in response to the adverse stock market condition back in december some policy makers might want to take the balance sheet reduction off autopilot this is definitely a topic fed chair jerome powell would be scrutinized in the post fomc meeting press conference on wednesday besides fomc meeting there are full of events in the us this week trump finally gave up the demand for the border wall temporarily on friday he agreed to a deal without funding for the wall that ended the 35 day historic government shutdown the deal was then quickly passed by senate and house without opposition now the congress will have up till february 15 to debate on border security a whole lot of economic data which missed schedule release day will likely come up gradually this week and more than that january non farm payrolls and ism manufacturing will be featured the highly anticipated meeting between us trade representative robert lighthizer and chinese vice premier liu he will take place on january 30 31 in washington ahead of that there will be vice ministerial meetings on monday and tuesday comments from the us side has been rather conflicting on the one hand commerce secretary wilbur ross said the two countries are miles and miles away on a trade deal but white house economic adviser larry kudlow said trump is optimistic but one thing for sure there is so far no news regarding how chines is going to handle the biggest concerns of the us including intellectual property threat forced technology transfer and opening up market access let s see if there will be any real progress in the negations dollar index to extend correction from 97 71 through 95 02 dollar index s sharp decline on friday is rather near term bearish it suggests failure to sustain above 55 day ema and the rebound from 95 02 has completed at 96 67 already corrective decline from 97 71 might now be ready to resume for 95 02 and below but after all downside should be contained by 93 81 94 09 support zone 38 2 retracement of 88 25 to 97 71 at 94 09 to bring rebound meanwhile even in case of recovery risk will now stay on the downside as long as 96 67 holds dow s not that strong close was rather disappointing while dow jumped to as high as 24860 15 but closed way off this high at 24737 20 the close is indeed rather disappointing considering the fed balance sheet rumor as well as news on ending government shut down for now further rise is still in favor as long as 24244 31 support holds however it looks like even in case of rally dow will start to feel heave in 24932 09 25820 34 resistance zone 61 8 and 78 6 retracement of 26951 81 to 21664 59 euro and dax survived dovish ecb and weak economic data euro survived some very weak economic data as well as dovish ecb last week it ended higher against all major currencies except sterling and new zealand dollar adding to that german dax and french cac ended the week higher extending recent rebound it seems that investors are seeing the worst in eurozone is behind ecb president mario draghi noted in the post meeting press conference that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside this is the first time since april 2017 that the central bank admitted that risks are to the downside over the past 21 months ecb had been describing risks as broadly balanced while suggesting the balance is moving to the downside the uncertainties ecb has identified are geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility meanwhile eurozone pmi composite dropped to 50 7 a 66 month low both manufacturing and services were close to stagnation at 50 5 and 50 8 they were at 50 month and 65 month low respectively german zew economic sentiment improved to 15 but stayed well below long term average of 22 4 zew current situation dropped sharply to 27 5 down from 45 3 german ifo business climate dropped to 99 1 lowest since february 2016 looking ahead q4 gdp in eurozone will be released and is expected to slow to 0 2 qoq eurozone cpi will also be featured and is expected to slow 0 2 to 1 4 yoy in january we ll see if euro could maintain its resilience along side the strength of euro german dax was also strong last week in particular rebound from 10279 20 resumed on friday by gapping higher 55 day ema is considered firmly taken out which is bullish adding to that there was bullish convergence condition in daily macd it s still early to confirm reversal of the down trend from 13596 89 but for now there is prospect of further near term rebound to 11726 62 support turned resistance which is also close to medium term channel resistance sterling strong as campaign for no deal brexit gathers momentum sterling ended as overwhelmingly the strongest as the campaign to rule out no deal brexit gathered momentum the house of commons will hold another day of brexit debate on tuesday january 29 given that prime minister theresa may s plan b is so very much like the original plan a it s not really the focal points of the debate instead attentions and debates will be on the next steps as put forward as amendments to the brexit deal one of the most high profile amendments was put forward by labour mp yvette copper which has cross party support in short if may couldn t get a deal approved by the parliament by february 26 the parliament will be give a vote on postponement of article 50 by nine months to avoid a no deal brexit the chance of getting this amendment through jumped after labour finance chief said the party will highly likely support it also other amendments including putting an expiry date to the irish backstop holding a second referendum ruling out no deal brexit with other means we ll have a much better idea on what s next after tuesday and if a no deal brexit is pretty much ruled out sterling could be give another boost position trading our buy usd chf at 0 9920 order was not filled last week as it rose to 0 9990 and then dropped to 0 9922 before closing at 0 9931 the entry was just missed dollar will likely be under some mild pressure this week at least initially as also reflected in dollar index outlook mentioned above but swiss franc is unlikely to benefit much from it firstly rebound in european stocks as seen with dax above is set to extend secondly strength or at least resilience in emerging market currencies for example in usd zar and usd try will limit franc rally too and technically we maintain the view that corrective fall from 1 0128 has completed at 0 9716 after drawing support from medium term trend line on bullish convergence condition in 4 hour macd hence rise from 0 9716 should resume after completing the retreat from 0 9990 and such rise is likely resuming whole up trend from 0 9186 hence we ll continue to try to buy usd chf but at a lower entry we ll buy usd chf at 0 9880 around 38 2 retracement of 0 9716 to 0 9990 at 0 9885 stop will be placed at 0 9810 below 61 8 retracement at 0 9821 target is placed at 1 0300 as we expect the upside to extend to take on 1 0342 resistance 2017 high gbp jpy weekly outlook gbp jpy s rebound from 131 51 extended to as high as 144 84 last week and there is no sign of topping yet initial bias remains on the upside this week for trendline resistance at around 147 35 we d expect strong resistance from there to limit upside at first attempt on the downside below 143 39 minor support will turn intraday bias neutral first and bring consolidations but further rise will remain in favor as long as 139 43 resistance turned support holds in the bigger picture the strong rebound from 131 51 suggests that medium term fall from 156 59 2018 high has completed already the corrective structure of such decline is turn argues that it s the second leg of the corrective pattern from 122 36 2016 low and this pattern is starting the third leg on the upside decisive break of 149 38 will pave the way to 156 59 resistance and above in the longer term picture the rise from 122 36 2016 low to 156 59 2018 high doesn t display a clear impulsive structure thus we re treating price actions from 122 36 as a corrective pattern in case of an extension strong resistance is likely to be seen at 50 retracement of 195 86 2015 high to 122 36 at 159 11 to limit upside on the downside break of 131 51 support will bring 122 26 low back into focus
a synchronized global economic slowdown is under way and any escalation in the us china trade war would trigger a sharper downturn according to reuters polls of hundreds of economists from around the world that is a major shift in sentiment from just a year ago when economists were optimistic about a significant global upturn but an escalation in trade tensions and tightening financial conditions have hurt activity in most economies and dragged china s growth last year to the weakest in 28 years reuters surveys over the past two years have repeatedly highlighted trade protectionism as one of the prominent downside risks for the global economy in the latest reuters polls of more than 500 economists taken this month growth this year was cut for 33 of 46 economies the respondents were asked about and left unchanged for 10 predictions for only three smaller economies were marginally upgraded the outlook for inflation this year was trimmed for most economies too with lower lows and lower highs over half of nearly 270 economists who answered an additional question said a further escalation in the us china trade war will likely trigger an even sharper global economic slowdown this year with a march 1 deadline set by the white house for an agreement or risk of an escalation of tariffs on another 200 billion worth of chinese goods both us president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping are still far apart on key structural elements critical for a deal those concerns coincide with a growing sense of unease among market experts polled by reuters who have consistently lowered their forecasts for various asset prices over the past few months from stock indexes to bond yields to oil irrespective of the truce between presidents trump and xi at their december meeting trade frictions are likely to weigh on activity in 2019 noted janet henry global chief economist at hsbc further tariff increases have been postponed but there has been no mention of the existing tariffs being lifted and the possibility of us tariffs being imposed on autos is still on the table despite a 90 day truce reached in early december and trump saying trade talks with china are going well concerns over the conflict have continued don t tell me anyone is really buying the drivel that a great deal is imminent between the us and china on trade we are in the early stages of a new cold war noted jan lambregts global head of financial markets at rabobank the global economy is forecast to expand 3 5 percent this year the second straight cut to the 2019 outlook after it was downgraded in the previous survey for the first time since polling began for that period in july 2017 in the last poll it was 3 6 percent that 3 5 percent lines up with the international monetary fund s growth outlook released ahead of the world economic forum in davos which highlighted the challenges policymakers face as they tackle the risk of a serious slowdown major central banks too have changed tack on their monetary policy path as they wind down crisis era measures while still facing an array of daunting risks despite predicting two rate hikes this year in line with the federal reserve s own dot plots economists now expect the us central bank to take rates higher in the second quarter instead of the first with a significant minority forecasting either one hike or none a sharp slowdown in euro zone economic growth became more prominent after europe s top economy germany barely skirted a recession in the second half of last year that has increased the prospect for policy normalization to be delayed global growth looks set to fall to its weakest pace since the financial crisis as slowdowns in the euro zone and china continue and the us soon joins the mix said andrew kenningham chief euro zone economist at capital economics us monetary policy tightening is pretty much over and the ecb seems set to miss the boat altogether in this cycle indeed it won t be long before policy loosening comes back on the agenda but it is not just developed economies growth in emerging markets were also forecast to take a hit this year and in an extraordinary u turn in policy the reserve bank of india was forecast to cut interest rates by mid year compared to a rate hike predicted just a month ago markets are rightly still alert to the potential for a bigger growth hit from the trade frictions but fears regarding the inflation outlook have eased back since early october added hsbc s henry the broader question is when considering how to respond to another economic downswing is which countries can increase leverage even as others are forced to retrench
what are the prospects for the coming year and beyond one could start by referring back to the global growth trajectory since the global financial crisis in 2008 a decline in gdp growth of 1 73 per cent was in fact recorded as a result of the crisis following which and naturally gdp growth rebounded by 4 31 per cent in 2010 to then hover between the 2 5 to 3 2 per cent mark source world bank this means that the recently revised gdp growth figures by the international monetary fund imf earlier this week to around 3 5 per cent in 2019 and 3 6 per cent in 2020 still makes both figures among the highest when compared to the post crisis highs the forecasted figures mentioned above for 2019 and 2020 are only modestly lower than what had been forecasted in last october s world economic outlook however back in october it is worth noting that such figures had already been revised lower it would be interesting to understand what has caused a change in global growth expectations once again perhaps you may have heard of the ongoing trade war between the us and china sarcasm this was highlighted in the imf s report published earlier this week as one of the main factors contributing negatively to the global growth expectations over the years to come the increases in tariffs enacted earlier in 2018 by both the us and china have had their contributing part and will continue to have as negotiations evolve moreover the report also makes reference to germany s introduction of new automobile fuel emission standards as well as concerns revolving italy s sovereign and financial risks which in turn impaired domestic demand one other contributing factor to these downward revisions was also the result of a general weakening financial market sentiment throughout the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as a deeper than previously projected contraction in turkey other substantial risks which could further increase any potential downside revisions to the global growth forecasts include a no deal brexit scenario and a slower growth in china than currently being forecasted recent gdp figures show that china has registered its slowest annual growth in almost 30 years nevertheless it is worth highlighting the fact that today s share of global gdp by china is also way larger than it used to be some 30 years ago making reference to one particular economic metric purchasing power parity ppp which in theory is the most comparable and fair across different countries china became the world s largest economy back in 2013 the ppp is a metric whereby the necessary adjustments are taken into account such as to adjust currencies in different countries in a manner where a basket of goods and services in the respective countries is worth the same apart from recording some 10 fold increase in gdp per person ppp adjusted since 1990 statistics also show that since the financial crisis of 2008 china accounted for approximately 45 per cent of the world s growth in gdp source the economist shifting back to what lies ahead and why forecasted gdp growth had to be revised downwards once again much of the headwind revolves around concerns in developed countries rather than emerging ones namely the imf highlighted significant downward revisions within the euro area as a result of production difficulties in germany the auto sector and lower external demand as well as italy s financial risks and the connections between the two as jamie dimon ceo of jp morgan chase highlighted earlier this week if brexit and trade between the us and china go south and the shutdown goes on for longer that will obviously only lead to further potential downward corrections over the months to come it is interesting to assess what the us government shutdown means and how this is not could affecting us growth since 1976 following the introduction of the congressional budget and impoundment control act which established the federal budget process the government has shutdown a total of 21 times half of such shutdowns lasted a weekend only however some of the remaining half lasted for quite a few days with data by the congressional research service indicating seven of which lasted for over 10 days the record for the longest shutdown in us history was broken on january 12 having reached the 22 day mark with such record lost by the clinton administration back in 1995 1996 21 days today s share of global gdp by china is way larger ironically enough the us federal reserve which is in need of fresh data in order to keep its policy decisions in sync with the us economy is being impacted directly as a result of the shutdown why any data relating to economic growth consumer spending jobs and inflation is all being halted as a result of departments responsible for the collection of such data being closed for instance the commerce department the unit that produces gdp figures with q4 data due at end of month has been closed for over a month likewise data relating to personal income and spending due on january 31 is likely to be delayed such data is one of the fed s preferred gauge for inflation indicating how far off prices are form the central bank s target of two per cent a recent article in the financial times also indicated how such a shutdown is actually beginning to hit economic growth economists are forecasting that quarterly growth could be impaired between 0 5 to one per cent should the shutdown last any longer although it would also be likely to witness a bounce back as the government reopens estimates by white house economists also suggest that the impact of some 380 000 federal workers who are not working could curb the us gdp growth by 0 08 percentage point each week the shutdown carries on similarly lost work by federal contractors could shave off some further 0 05 percentage point at the time of writing senators were supposed to vote on thursday on bills from both parties such as to bring the government shutdown to an end although it was still unclear whether either measure can pass what is certain is that the longer it lasts other than directly impairing economic growth the more will it directly impact consumer economic sentiment and potentially lead to global rating agencies such as s p and fitch having to re evaluate the country s credit rating the 10 year treasury yield has since the early dip of around 2 60 per cent at beginning of the month bounced higher to around 2 73 per cent which could have potentially justified the relatively stable if not stronger us dollar since then however as the us deadlock stretches any further markets will perhaps need to reassess the situation and take action on their dollar positions let us hope for light at the end of the tunnel not to give any reason for markets to reverse the positive direction they have embarked on since the beginning of 2019 concluding although it is easier said than done whatever lies ahead my word of advice is to always sit tight

if there is one useful conclusion that economists and investors can draw from the crazy year that has just ended indeed from the whole crazy decade since the global financial crisis of 2008 it is this as they say in hollywood nobody knows anything in the film industry the richest and most experienced studios and producers spend vast amounts of time and money on audience research but still have no idea if their latest creations will turn out to be hits or flops so why be surprised if the same is true of financial markets or for that matter of commodity prices policymaking and corporate performance why be shocked if the world s richest company admits as apple did after christmas that it has no idea how many iphones it will sell in china or if the world s best informed energy traders predict a global supply shortage that will boost oil prices above 100 just when a supply glut sends the market tumbling to 50 or if the us president doesn t know if he hates or loves global trade or if stock markets predict a global economic boom when bond markets predict recession and then both reverse suddenly contradicting each other in the opposite direction at this time last year economic expectations were almost universally optimistic every region of the world appeared to be simultaneously booming for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis central bankers were confident that they could safely start to withdraw their extraordinary monetary stimulus and stock market investors were almost unanimously bullish yet 2018 turned into the worst year for investors since the financial crisis forcing central bankers to begin backing away from their plans to normalize monetary policy economists to downgrade their growth forecasts and many businesses to prepare for recession in 2019 or 2020 what went wrong economic data were only slightly weaker than expected in the second half of 2018 the world bank for example has reduced its estimates of global growth in 2018 and 2019 by just 0 1 percentage points to 3 and 2 9 respectively since its june outlook the main cause for concern has been the behaviour of financial markets many economists saw the simultaneous plunge in long term interest rates and equity prices in december as an indicator of recession either investors know something awful that is not yet evident in the statistics or declining market sentiment would become a self fulfilling prophecy by causing businesses or consumers to cut back but before concluding that financial markets can always predict or shape the future we should recall that economic and policy changes usually move financial expectations not vice versa so what events apart from market volatility would cause a recession or severe global slowdown a popular answer is simply the passage of time the global economic expansion that began in 2009 has already lasted almost ten years if a us recession does not occur by 2020 the country will have experienced the longest uninterrupted expansion in its history there is nothing in economic theory or historical experience to suggest that expansions die of old age or that recessions happen spontaneously but expansions do become more vulnerable to diseases of old age high interest rates rising energy prices accelerating inflation or banking crises that are triggered when unsustainably high property prices suddenly collapse and if none of these economic mishaps occurs eventually political leaders can become recklessly overconfident leading to wars trade conflicts or gross budgetary mismanagement several of these problems began to appear in 2018 rising interest rates in the us fiscal tightening in italy and much of europe an escalating tariff war between the us and china and higher energy prices around the world it is not surprising therefore that the world economy slowed in 2018 instead of accelerating as most economists including me expected but many of the forces that caused last year s slowdown are now reversing oil prices have fallen us bond yields are back to almost where they started in 2018 trade conflicts appear to be subsiding and china is easing macroeconomic policy at least to some extent and will probably move to outright stimulus if its economy weakens much further the policy changes and political events just described were clearly the main drivers of last year s market shocks for example january s stock market correction and volatility surge were clearly caused by fears of us overheating and rising bond yields once the overheating concerns subsided bond repricing turned out to be very limited equities everywhere rebounded and the dollar remained very weak dollar weakness and global equity strength reversed abruptly in may when markets were hit by a perfect storm of the three political shocks that i had considered most likely soaring oil prices in anticipation of iran sanctions the us china tariff war and the formation of a left right populist government in italy in october with political risks receding emerging markets started to outperform stock markets stabilized elsewhere even in europe the oil price returned to what looked like a stable pre sanctions range of 60 65 and the strengthening of the dollar ended in short markets seemed to move broadly in line with the changing political and macroeconomic fundamentals until everything suddenly went haywire in early december for the next three weeks until december 24 the s p 500 collapsed by 16 for no apparent reason brent oil plunged from 61 to 50 the dollar again strengthened and yields on ten year us bonds fell from 3 to 2 7 if all of the main fundamentals suggest that economic growth in 2019 could end up as strong or even stronger than in 2018 why did equity prices and bond yields suddenly collapse last month could it be that investors are so confused by political chaos that they have given up trying to anticipate what could happen next if so then markets instead of being predictive become increasingly reactive simply extrapolating recent events in a world where nobody knows anything investors may be no better than hollywood moguls at predicting the future project syndicate
by kevin yao beijing reuters china will take steps to spur growth amid a trade war with the united states but there is limited room for aggressive stimulus in an economy already laden with massive debts and a property market prone to credit driven spikes policy insiders said china s deepening economic slowdown has fanned market expectations of a big spending binge especially if the bruising tariff war with washington escalates intensifying pressure on chinese jobs and threatening social stability such a move plans for which have repeatedly been denied by china s top leaders would come at a price however similar moves in the past have quickly juiced growth rates but also buried the world s no 2 economy under a mountain of debt the room for a strong stimulus is not big and there are very big risks because that will rely on a flood of cash and increased leverage in the economy said a policy insider declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter during the 2008 09 global financial crisis beijing rolled out a 4 trillion yuan 591 billion spending package to fight a downturn that cost 20 million jobs in a matters of months quickly reviving growth but also prompting a credit explosion the obsession of china s leaders with stability led to policy easing in 2012 and 2015 a year marked by a stock market crash a slide in the yuan and sharp capital outflows that further pushed up debt levels and inflated home prices authorities have taken a raft of pro growth measures in the past year in the form of cuts to the levels of cash banks must hold as reserves to spur lending tax cuts and efforts to accelerate infrastructure spending still growth in the world s second largest economy weakened to a 28 year low of 6 6 percent in 2018 and is expected to slow further to 6 3 percent this year sources have told reuters that beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6 6 5 percent this year from around 6 5 percent in 2018 some chinese factories have felt the pinch from higher u s tariffs but there are few signs of a sharp rise in unemployment due to a more resilient services sector and a shrinking pool of workers as a result of the country s demographic changes we should be vigilant about employment pressure but it s too early to talk about serious problems said a second policy insider debt risks the current slowdown was caused by china s deleveraging drive in early 2016 which focused on state firms and local governments before broadening to the financial sector a year later a crackdown on shadow lending pushed up borrowing costs and made it harder for small firms to get funds as the trade war increases headwinds beijing s policy focus has been shifted to supporting growth from reining in debt risks although top leaders remain worried about long term systemic risks that could derail the country s economic ascent president xi jinping said this week that china must be on guard against black swan risks meaning unforeseen events that have extreme consequences while fending off so called grey rhino events obvious threats that go ignored data from the bank for international settlements bis showed that china s debt to gross domestic product gdp ratio climbed to 253 percent at the end of june 2018 from 231 percent at end 2015 although the pace of increases is slowing fitch could cut china s a credit rating or stable outlook if beijing reverts to the kind of debt fueled stimulus programs it has used in the past the firm s top sovereign analyst said earlier this month further reductions in banks reserve requirement ratios rrr are expected in coming quarters but the central bank will not rush into cutting benchmark interest rates more aggressive easing could pressure the yuan aggravate high debt levels and even stoke property speculation given that elevated home prices have put strains on consumers if there is too much liquidity we should worry whether it may flow into unintended areas rather than the real economy said a policy adviser no quick boost to growth china is likely to lean more on fiscal pump priming to support the economy this year as the central government has been struggling to channel more credit into small and private firms that are vital for growth and jobs policy insiders said in december top leaders pledged to step up counter cyclical support for the economy and said fiscal policy would be more forceful and effective and monetary policy would be prudent with appropriate tightness and looseness details on the fiscal stimulus are expected to be unveiled during the annual parliamentary meeting in march analysts expect china to deliver tax and fee cuts of 2 trillion yuan in 2019 versus last year s 1 3 trillion yuan and let local governments issue 2 trillion yuan in off budget special bonds to fund key projects up from 1 35 trillion yuan but the economy may not get a quick boost as the raft of policy measures may take time to kick in and china s high debt levels and falling investment returns could slow down spending stimulus won t be very strong and its impact won t be big said one of the policy insiders the manufacturing sector faces all round oversupply while infrastructure investment is saturated in many places projects that have been launched won t make money new tax cuts including lowering the valued added tax vat for firms could give hard pressed small and private firms a shot in the arm and force the government to tighten its belt the finance ministry has pledged a 5 percent cut in general government spending 1 6 7639 renminbi this story was

as putin famously put it the breakup of the soviet union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the century it did indeed seem as though the breakup of the ussr left the united states the last man standing and thus the sole hegemon of the world as expressed by its foreign policy it believed at that point it could do what it wanted and what it wanted was to ensure that in the future no power whether regional or international would ever arise to challenge it again it believed that it at last had what it had desired for so long a world under its complete control from that point on the nations of the world would conform to its central values democracy in the political realm and free markets in the economic realm thus the delusion was propagated that political equality without economic equality would actually make people equal and that free market economics would improve rather than degrade the conditions of existence of the peoples of world if anyone has any doubt that after the fall of the soviet union the goal of american foreign policy was to destroy any and all challenges to its power and that the ideological justification for doing so would be the propagation of democracy and free markets that doubt will be quickly eliminated by even a cursory reading of which is just an extended elaboration of what is called wolfowitz doctrine and so it is that any nation no matter how large or how small will not be allowed to defy let alone challenge the control of the united states if it does so it will find itself in the crosshairs of america s powerful weapons these weapons are of a two fold nature on the one hand they are economic and ideological on the other they are weapons in the truest sense of the word technologically advanced and precise lethal weapons of mass destruction such as have been routinely aimed at various nations of the world they kill quickly the economic weapons operate more like pythons the impulse of the python is to entwine and constrict it encircles and crushes its victims until they are dead still and ready to be consumed the muscles used to crush unfortunate peoples are sanctions which financially isolate the country from the rest of the world and lead to hyperinflation most recently president trump has also flexed his muscles with tariffs like obama before him trump has relied on a time honored tool for asserting america s hegemony the international emergency economic powers act enacted in 1977 the ieepa gives the president the authority to act in response to any foreign threat to the national security foreign policy or economy of the united states this is the act legitimizes sanctions against venezuela russia iran north korea and other nations what all these countries have in common is a failure to kow tow to american hegemony venezuela has long endured america s pythonic efforts to crush it it has neither submitted nor caved in under the crushing pressure of american economic weapons the sanctions congress imposed on venezuela in 2014 were justified as a defense of the human and civil rights of the people stating that under the leadership of president chavez and now president maduro the accumulation of power in the executive branch and the erosion of human rights guarantees have enabled the government to intimidate censor and prosecute its critics in addition hypocritically and illogically it points to the poverty of the people as a reason for the imposition of the sanctions knowing full well that the sanctions would only make them more impoverished the fact of the matter is that the reasons the sanctions had been imposed was because for a long time the leaders of venezuela had resisted capitalist domination when oil prices collapsed in the 1980s inflation rose to 84 in 1989 the people rioted for three days against government plans urged by the imf to privatize assets cut food and fuel subsidies and the amount spent on health and education then president perez who had implemented the policies demanded by the imf characterized them as a neutron bomb that killed people but left buildings standing the political structures and parties of the venezuelan bourgeoisie could not contain the people and a socialist revolution led by hugo chavez ensued he was a fierce foe of capitalism and loyal friend of the leftist block of latin american countries that sought to curb u s influence in the region he would nationalize key industries establish social welfare programs improve health and education services for the people in a most audacious move in 2005 chavez began a program to provide reduced priced heating oil for the impoverished people in the united states i remember being both shocked and pleased when i saw ads on american tv sponsored by the chavez government in which poor people expressed their gratitude to venezuela for providing them fuel to heat their homes little wonder that in 2002 the bourgeoisie and some members of the military attempted a coup which involved the kidnapping of chavez as cia records prove the u s government and media supported the attempted overthrow before the putsch took place there had been street protests led by leopoldo lópez the coup was defeated by the venezuelan people themselves who demanded chavez s return and restored him to power in 48 hours one should remember the two coup attempts that occurred in russia the first against brezhnev that yeltsin with the aid of the u s helped curtail and the second by communists to return to power yeltsin simply turned the tanks loose on them just as the venezuelan military remained loyal to maduro in the face of another attempted coup led by the united states most recently so too had they remained loyal to chavez and so it was impossible to use force against the people that was the difference between the outcomes in russia and in venezuela for years after the death of chavez maduro faced the chaos that was the result of the pythonization of his nation in response he has created a new currency the sovereign bolivar the value of which is pegged to the price of one barrel of petroleum the national oil company pdvsa will thus transfer a huge oil field in the orinoco belt to the venezuelan central bank oil will thus take the place of gold as the support for venezuela s currency if the mafias dollarize prices the government of venezuela will petroize them maduro argued venezuelans took to the streets of caracas in a show of support for the new economic reforms that took effect as part of the government s economic recovery plan however one should never forget that should the python fail to subdue its prey the cobra will be called in on august 6 2018 drones armed with explosives detonated while maduro was delivering a speech being broadcast live on television those who attempted to assassinate maduro had no qualms about doing so openly in russia a similar process had been implemented in the late 1980s under brezhnev and yeltsin their economic advisers principally chubias and gadar under the direct guidance of cia operatives and with the help of u s government and ngo financial support were implementing shock therapy in russia the rapid transformation of a communist economy into a capitalist one resulted the impoverishment of the people a steep devaluation of the rouble and rise of a greedy capitalist class who sought not only economic but political control over the nation the man who stopped them was no socialist but was rather a fierce nationalist who would not allow his country to be ground into the dirt by foreign powers vladimir putin the defensive python measures he would undertake to protect his country such as the repatriation of crimea would cause the python to be released on russia on march 6 2014 the president obama issued e o 13660 pursuant to inter alia the ieep and imposed sanctions on russia the imposition of sanctions against persons responsible for or complicit in certain activities with respect to ukraine against officials of the government of the russian federation against persons operating in the arms or related materiel sector of the russian federation and against individuals and entities operating in the crimea region of ukraine on certain entities operating in specified sectors of the russian federation economy also prohibited was the importation or exportation of goods services or technology to or from the crimea region of ukraine as well as new investment in the crimea region of ukraine by a united states person wherever located on august 2 2017 president trump signed into law the countering america s adversaries through sanctions act public law 115 44 caatsa which among other things imposed new sanctions on iran russia and north korea the countering america s adversaries through sanctions act caatsa was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support strong input from industry and think tanks and cooperation from european allies russia s response in the years after the first major sanctions were imposed has been to commit to fiscal restraint and focus on rebuilding its international reserves russia has slowly but steadily been divesting itself of the dollar and increasing its reserves of gold russian energy minister aleksandr novak recently noted that a growing number of countries are interested in replacing the dollar as a medium in global oil trades and other transactions thus the kremlin has said it is interested in trading with ankara using the russian ruble and the turkish lira india has also vowed to pay for iranian oil in rupees like russia china too has been building up its gold reserves moreover china has also been taking steps to challenge the greenback s dominance with the launch of an oil futures contract backed by chinese currency the petro yuan there are two questions regarding the way of the python the first regards its victims will they be able to free themselves from its crushing grip by delinking from the dollar or building solid supports oil or gold for its currencies the second is whether the python will squeeze so tight that it will crush itself there is the distinct possibility that the sanctions could destabilize the energy and financial markets sanctions have already had a small but negative financial impact on eu countries that have done business with russia sanctions also target some of the world s largest banks and energy companies such as sberbank and gazprom which does not bode well for the world economy gazprom supplies energy to a large part of europe what is going to happen if those energy supplies are disrupted western companies would be unable to use russian railways to transport their products every company in which russia is a minority stake holder would suffer from sanctions meanwhile american companies have had to dismantle joint ventures and divest from hundreds of energy projects across the globe and dump billions of dollars invested in russian projects so it is today that the united states unable to bring about a coup and unable to bring maduro and his people to heel seems ready to abandon the way of the python as it threatens the sovereign nation of venezuela with military intervention in doing so they face the united front of those nations which like venezuela have been feeling or will soon feel as in the case of the people s republic of china the cobra like economic muscles of the u s cuba the russian federation the people s republic of china among so many others it is interesting to note that the overwhelming majority of the countries who have come forward to confront the united states for its treatment of venezuela either are or have been communist socialist countries i say this lest the united states in its wolfowitz world view think that it really has defeated communism or that socialist ideals do not still move the hearts and minds of the people or that america truly does have absolute control over the world if so america

three concerns hanging over the davos elite this week the global elite descended private jets to their version of winter ski camp the lifestyles of the rich and powerful version the world economic forum s wef five day annual networking extravaganza kicked off in the upscale ski resort town of davos switzerland every year the powers that be join the wef select a theme uniting some 3000 participants ranging from public office holders to private company executives to the few organizations that truly do help fix the world that they mess up this year s theme is globalization 4 0 or the digital revolution the idea being the potential tech take over of jobs and what wealthier countries are doing to lesser developed ones in the process while the topic might be focused on the future the present is just as troubling if not more so than the future such is the disconnect between real people and corporations that s what the estimated 600 000 swiss franc membership to be a part of the wef constellation gets you as a ceo at the davos table government leaders like german chancellor angela merkel brazil s president jair bolsonaro and chinese vice president wang qishan are in attendance this week business leaders like microsoft co founder bill gates and jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon will also take part in the festivities yet even though the various leaders will likely promote their achievements what s lurking behind the pristine snowcapped alps is a dark foreboding of a less secure world nearly every major forecast from around the world is projecting an economic slowdown as one bloomberg article reports companies are the most bearish since 2016 as economic data falls short of expectations and political risks mount amid an international trade war u s government shutdown and brexit the list of non attendees includes u s president donald trump uk prime minister theresa may and french president emmanuel macron they are too busy dealing with complex political problems in their own government institutions and domestic home fronts to make the trek below is a breakdown of the three flashpoints that the davos crowd should be watching in 2019 economic growth will slow signs of slowing global economic growth are increasing we re seeing that in both smaller emerging market countries and larger more complex ones weaker than anticipated data from the u s china japan and europe are stoking worries about the worldwide outlook for 2019 many mainstream outlets are beginning to understand the turmoil ahead goldman sachs my old firm is predicting an economic slowdown in the u s and the international monetary fund imf has revised downward its 2019 u s growth prediction to 2 5 from 2 7 from 2018 it believes that the u s will be negatively impacted by the economic slowdowns of american trade partners and that the 2020 slowdown could be even sharper as a result the imf also points to pressure from ongoing trade tensions between the u s and china and growing dysfunction between the u s and other major trading partners such as europe because the world s economies have become increasingly interdependent problems in one economy can have widespread consequences we learned this once before the collapse of u s based investment bank lehman brothers triggered a greater international banking crisis in 2008 that sort of connectivity has only grown the reality is that we may now face even greater threats than forecast so far which could lead to another financial or credit crisis it is likely that china could be ground zero for a global economic slowdown recent data out of china indicates that much global gdp and trade activity that should normally be in the first quarter q1 of 2019 was pulled forward into q4 2018 to beat the tariff increase it s likely that the same phenomenon could happen in the u s if this trend does snowball you should expect to see rapidly deteriorating economic numbers arriving in the months ahead debt burdens will worsen no matter how you slice it public corporate and individual debt levels around the world are at historical extremes household debt figures from the new york federal reserve noted that u s household debt which includes mortgage debt auto debt and credit card debt was hovering at around 13 5 trillion that debt has risen for 17 straight quarters what is different this time is that current levels are higher than just before the 2008 financial crisis hit in addition global debt reached 247 trillion in the first quarter of 2018 by mid year the global debt to gdp ratio had exceeded 318 that means every dollar of growth cost more than three dollars of debt to produce after a decade of low interest rates courtesy of the fed and other central banks the total value of non financial global debt both public and private rose by 60 to hit a record high of 182 trillion in addition the quality of that debt has continued to deteriorate that sets the scene for a riskier environment over on wall street they are already disguising debt by stuffing smaller riskier or leveraged loans into more complex securities it s the same disastrous formula that was applied in the 2008 subprime crisis now landmark institutions like moody s investors service and s p global are finally sounding the alarm on these leveraged loans and the collateralized loan obligations clos that wall street is creating from them clo issuance in the u s has risen by more than 60 since 2016 unfortunately it should come as no surprise that wall street is now proposing even looser standards on these risky securities the idea is that the biggest banks on wall street can actively repackage risky leveraged loans into dodgy securities while the music is still playing if rates do rise or economic growth deteriorates so will these loans and the clos that contain them potentially causing a new credit crisis this year if the music stops or investors no longer want to buy the clos that wall street is selling look out below corporate earnings will be lower with earnings season now underway we can expect a lot of gaming of results in contrast to earlier reports and projections what i learned from my time on wall street is that this is a standard dance that happens between financial analysts and corporations what you should know is that companies will always want to maximize share prices there are several ways to do that one way is for companies to buy their own shares which we saw happen in record numbers recently this process was aided by the savings from the trump corporate tax cuts as well as the artificial stimulus that was provided by the fed through its easy money strategy another way is to reduce earnings expectations or fake out the markets that way even if earnings do fall they look better than forecast which gives shares a pop in response however that pop can be followed by a fall because of the lower earnings the third way is to simply do well as a business in a slowing economic environment however that becomes harder to do plus it s even more difficult in today s environment of geopolitical uncertainty as a multitude of key elections take place around the world in the coming months these three concerns were central in conversation in davos expect global markets to be alert to the comments coming from the swiss mountain town severe dips and further volatility could be ahead if any gloomy rhetoric streams from the davos gathering how will the fed react ready to help is the answer this month yet another top federal reserve official noted that economic growth could be slowing down that would mean the fed should as powell indicated switch from its prior fixed plan of gradually raising interest rates to a more ad hoc approach indeed federal reserve bank of new york president john williams used chairman powell s new buzz phrase data dependence to indicate that the fed would be watching the economy more while he didn t say it explicitly it has become largely clear that the markets are determining fed policy based on my own analysis along with high level meetings in dc i see growing reasons to believe the fed will back off its hawkish policy stance as we continue to sound the alarm there are now a myriad of reasons including trade wars slowing global economic conditions and market volatility traders are now assigning only a 15 chance of another rate hike by june just three months ago those odds were 45 watch for even more market volatility with upward movements coming from increasingly dovish statements released by the fed and other central banks expect added downward outcomes from state of the global economy along with geo political pressures regards nomi prins

convenes its first monetary policy meeting of 2019 after hiking rates for a fifth time in as many quarters in december but while it has forecast two more hikes for 2019 the darkening global economic outlook convulsing stock markets and a record long government shutdown are clouding the policy picture now fed chairman jerome powell is preaching patience with regard to future rate increases and he s been joined by two other governors and all 12 fed regional bank presidents but what happens after such a pause interest rate futures markets currently assign a roughly 20 percent probability for a move above the current 2 25 2 50 percent range for the fed funds target rate at any 2019 meeting a year from now a rate cut is almost as probable as a rate hike most previous fed pauses are associated with the end of a cycle and followed by a change in policy direction yet the current tightening cycle and previous two easing phases have featured mid cycle pauses so how rare would a rate hike resumption be after this newest holding period in both the 2000 2003 and 2007 2009 cutting cycles the fed took at least one hiatus of six months or longer and resumed cuts later in the present one they ve managed extended pauses twice since this cycle s first december 2015 hike a full year lapsed between the first and second hike six months between hikes four and five graphic bring on the pause

kind of agreement even if u s commerce secretary wilbur ross said the two sides were miles and miles from resolving their trade issues he did after all admit there was a fair chance of a deal eventually so far there is little clarity on how bad it could get for china s and for the world economy and how much stimulus beijing may be happy to provide this time round china s obsession with

ago that s just as well greater focus though is on averting a no deal brexit a scenario in which the uk crashes out of the eu with no trade agreement that looks achievable the opposition and many ruling party members will likely back an amendment providing for a nine month extension to brexit should a deal not be agreed by feb 26 meanwhile warnings against no deal brexit are coming in thick

key macro strategy themes for 2019 overall global markets started the year with positive returns from most equity markets can this positive momentum continue our research team at scb securities stands by our optimistic view we offer four top of mind themes for 2019 affecting our investment decisions going forward 1 a synchronised slowdown in major economies from their peak will continue to generate volatility throughout 2019 developed markets are entering a late cycle especially the united states which is coming off a growth peak in the first half of 2018 as stimulus from the tax cut fades the european union will face a bumpy geopolitical path in several countries jittery coalitions in greece and italy yellow vest protesters in france weaker pro eu parties in germany and the brexit mess is likely to get worse before it gets better japan meanwhile will go through another round of fiscal drag from a bump up in the sales tax china s economic expansion will continue to slow hurting confidence and the earnings growth outlook implications risky assets will continue to be volatile driven by a difficult to predict news flow however equity markets are likely to provide a decent return on investment for those who can withstand short term volatility this is based on the market view that there is unlikely to be an outright recession in 2019 and that company earnings will continue to grow 2 monetary policy changes become more accommodative recent signals from the us federal reserve are clearly more dovish after an increase in its policy rate each quarter in 2018 it is beginning to signal a halt in increases and the market sees a more than 50 chance of no hikes at all in 2019 china s central bank has reversed its tightening stance and is beginning to lower interest rates inject more liquidity and lower the reserve requirement allowing banks to lend more in europe markets now see a greater chance that the first rate hikes in years will be postponed to 2020 from late 2019 implications the tightening liquidity trend is about to pause or even reverse the risk of over tightening monetary policy a common factor that pushed economies into recession in past cycles has been reduced this is good for risky assets especially emerging market equities the pause is also positive for yield plays such as property funds real estate investment trusts reits and infrastructure funds which also benefit from more fiscal stimulus via public investment 3 oil prices rebound it should not take much for the world oil price to recover from the recent low of us 45 a barrel a level considered below break even cost for most shale producers the us energy information administration revised down its excess supply forecast for 2019 in its most recent report on jan 15 and expects the price of west texas intermediate wti crude to rise back to around 60 up 30 from last year s bottom opec has just cut output by the most in two years down 751 000 barrels per day in december a good sign for the opec russia deal to cut 1 2 million bpd in the first half of this year the oil price bottom is already behind us implications higher oil prices are good for thai equities in the energy sector they also lend support to higher inflation which is a key driver for a steepening yield curve normally associated with improving bank profitability 4 thailand s domestic demand growth story will counter the global slowdown exports have already slowed along with regional peers hurt by the trade dispute between the us and china while we expect the situation to improve based on signals from both sides after mid january meetings the impact from the current tax on trade is likely to last for some time the key drivers for the thai economy will have to come from domestic demand which continued to accelerate through the second half of 2018 despite slower growth in headline gdp private investment will continue to expand in response to rising capacity utilisation foreign direct investment inflows will remain strong thanks to stimulus measures related to the eastern economic corridor infrastructure investment and some windfall from companies expanding or diversifying out of china due to the trade dispute with the us implications our key investment themes for early 2019 have been based on domestic demand stories such as the investment cycle private and public rising interest rates and improving household consumption overall as part of the late expansion cycle investors should expect higher volatility and possibly lower capital gains growth stocks are likely to underperform those with attractive valuations and strong yields in terms of portfolio management investors should increase exposure to reits and infrastructure funds keep some cash in the money market stand ready to buy on dips to benefit from increasing volatility add some gold for hedging purposes also add some oil exposure to benefit from the rebound

houthi held hodeida will yemen finally see a turn for the better in 2019 last month s peace talks in sweden raised hopes that the tide had finally turned in a nation battered by nearly four years of civil war and the ensuing famine with three quarters of the population dependent on humanitarian assistance but the truce and prisoner swaps promised in december have yet to materialise much of the pressure of late has been on the saudis and the western backed coalition they ve been leading in air strikes that continue to kill innocent civiliants but the united nations and its mediation teams have voiced exasperation with both sides france 24 s team went to the north to territory held by iran aligned houthi militias that have consolidated their grip on the capital sana a since the

around the strategic port city of hodeida a gateway to food and supplies for 70 of the country france 24 in yemen children pay ultimate price for conflictour reporters have been to the yemeni city of saada which is controlled by houthi rebels it has seen some of the worst battles since fighting broke out between the iran backed houthis and the saudi led coalition in 2014 for civilians particularly children life has become hell on earth some people may find the images in this report disturbing just back from yemen france 24 s reporter cyril payen speaks to us about the difficulties he and his

pass through the isolated red sea port city of hodeida which has been under siege for months yemen s government coalition and the houthi rebels agreed to a ceasefire in hodeida in mid december after a breakthrough at peace talks in sweden the agreement calls for the withdrawal and redeployment of rival forces from the city but the pull out has yet to be realised this port is the most vital location in yemen houthi official omar al jarbhouzi tells france 24 it is also the most attacked and the most destroyed the coalition uses it as a weapon to push its strategy the port is the gateway for 70 percent of yemen s food there are 20 million yemenis depending on supplies that should be arriving on these docks but aren t jarbhouzi said france 24 reports from yemen a daily struggle just to surviveyemen s port city hodeida has been under siege for months with the threat of being shot by a stray bullet and the constant bombardment just going out for food is incredibly dangerous for the people of the city france 24 s reporters bring you this exclusive report i m always a bit scared when i m in the streets says 20 year old abdullah whose family moved to hodeida from the south one year

ada overwhelmed families struggling to survive in war torn sanaa yemen s ancient capitalin the last of five reports from war ravaged yemen france 24 s reporters take us to the heart of the old city of sanaa the country s ancient capital which has been blighted by more than four years of war for more than 2 500 years the old city of sanaa has stood proud on the high plateau of northern yemen but as war has blighted the country swathes of the ancient city have now been pummelled into ruins when the war broke out even though i survived the bombings i lost everything my job my life says sami saleh al sayani a tour guide in yemen s old city at one point there was hope for yemen but the tourists are gone everything has collapsed sami leads us through the heart of the old city where families struggle just to survive amid the ruins of bombing raids we are not interested in politics we are not houthis residents say referring to the shiite militia that controls much of northern yemen including the capital city we are simple people of the old city we have lived here for generations why are we bombed in 2015 unesco placed the old city of sanaa on its list of endangered world heritage sites unesco rules are very clear in terms of world heritage protection to prevent a protected city from becoming a war zone otherwise it constitutes war crimes says amat alrazaaq jahaf at the sanaa heritage centre but five years have passed and i have never seen any un official come to witness these crimes france 24 s own cyril payen on his exclusive report on yemen b h k p starvation diplomacy and ruthless friends the yemen annual review 2018the sana a center editorial beyond the brinkyemen is no longer on the brink of catastrophe rather it has already been pushed into the abyss and therein continues to fall after four years of war yemen has suffered the destruction of its infrastructure economy social fabric and much more yemenis are a nation traumatized by human loss and starvation in the past year photos of malnourished children have become synonymous with yemen worldwide yet as much as it deserved the media attention the story of the world s worst humanitarian crisis at times concealed the fact that this is not a natural disaster that has befallen yemen it is an accumulation of political conflicts within the country exacerbated by reckless regional interference backed by the world s western powers aid organizations are now preparing for another year of humanitarian suffering the united nations has announced plans to raise funds amounting to us4 billion a third more than last year s appeal for roughly us 3 billion with saudi arabia and the united arab emirates funding about a third of the appeal however humanitarian organizations are reaching their capacity limits while the immense looting and confiscation of humanitarian supplies in which belligerent parties are engaged means aid itself is at times helping to finance the war instead of reaching those in need neither the coalition powers nor the western countries backing them should therefore content themselves with pouring aid into yemen yemen desperately needs political decisions to be made at a closer look developments last year demonstrated clearly that the crisis in yemen is political at its core and that s how it needs to be addressed it was new geopolitical dynamics that encouraged decisions to contain yemen s downward spiral toward the end of 2018 even if decisions came late unexpectedly and at times resulted from events that on face value had little relation to the yemen conflict at the epicenter of the conflict and its shifting dynamics were the city of hudaydah and the nearby ports the last access houthi forces have left to the red sea these ports are also the entry point for most of the basic commodities feeding a nation descending into mass famine for some two years the saudi led military coalition has been pushing for a military campaign to take hudaydah however international concern that cargo shipments would be interrupted and trigger a humanitarian catastrophe has been intense and the coalition was waiting for a green light from its main backers the united states and the united kingdom to pursue the offensive near the midpoint of 2018 washington gave what amounted to a yellow light according to a us government official who spoke with the sana a center at the time the strategic and military preparations for the campaign changed the calculations of various groups in the anti houthi coalition for instance the uae had for the past several years built proxy militias in areas the yemeni government is meant to control with these militias often challenging the government s authority and some seeking to partition the country in 2018 however unity among anti houthi ground forces was seen as paramount for the battle for hudaydah with uae prompting these disparate groups closed ranks and put differences aside for the military campaign symbolic of this were the visits to abu dhabi by yemeni president abdo rabbu mansour hadi and islah party leaders in 2018 through the latter half of 2018 the coalition s efforts to drive the houthis from hudaydah progressed slowly and effectively stalled at the southern edge of the city threatening to become a battle of attrition simultaneously international pressure was building on saudi arabia pressure that was then key to facilitating the un led peace consultations in sweden and the stockholm agreement that halted the battle for hudaydah it was however not the possible starvation of millions of yemenis that created the international momentum for peace consultations and a ceasefire rather it was the media spectacle around the murder of one man saudi journalist jamal khashoggi at his country s consulate in istanbul that provoked international outcry and prompted washington and london to force riyadh s hand many western leaders had been growing increasingly uncomfortable over reckless saudi foreign policy and were embarrassed by reports of war crimes in yemen committed by their ally including bombing buses full of school children and siege tactics that have helped push the country toward mass starvation however while western countries above all the us and the uk had enabled the saudi led military intervention in yemen they had no hand in khashoggi s murder which allowed for an opportunity to criticize riyadh while claiming the moral high ground the stockholm agreement endorsed by the un security council came about thanks to international pressure saudi influence over the yemeni government and the belligerent parties each wanting to avoid blame for the peace process failure at the same time both sides were hoping to gain an advantage the un special envoy for yemen martin griffiths secured the warring parties commitments not through compromise but by watering down the language in the deal to the point that what the parties actually committed to is widely up to their own discretion in the short time it has been since the talks it is apparent the parties are interpreting their commitments quite differently neither regarded the talks as a stepping stone to a greater accord but rather a localized accommodation president hadi technically still a transitional president who was meant to leave office in 2014 also knows his exit from power is almost assured if and when a peace deal is signed hadi s choice to send a delegation to sweden was however not his to make given that he is beholden to his saudi patrons indeed hadi has attempted to govern his country from riyadh since 2015 the armed houthi movement likewise attended the talks under duress their leadership is keenly aware that the greatest victory they could possibly achieve at this point is to survive the pummeling houthi forces have been sustaining on the battlefield has left them smarting and looking for a way to ease the pressure there is however little to no chance that the houthis will cede a military defeat to their opponents and while they have been militarily pressured in the territories they control they have acted increasingly paranoid and continued to craft their own police state persecuting minorities staging show trials and executions banning civil society groups and launching arrest campaigns to purge undesirables such as free thinking journalists human rights advocates and others institutionalizing the extortion of businesses workers and aid organizations conscripting children into combat roles and propagating religious zealotry upon the masses before the houthis took over there was more than 20 daily and weekly independent newspapers publishing from sana a today there are only houthi publications meanwhile the ongoing war also pushed them closer to tehran which is ironic given that saudi arabia and the uae launched their military intervention in yemen to prevent what they saw as iranian encroachment in their backyard thus the war has become increasingly complex as it has proceeded entrenching the clout of warlords and armed groups as it goes and advancing the country s fragmentation this trend is likely to continue in the absence of a broader settlement to end the conflict the details of what a political settlement would look like remain elusive but some of the parameters are clear b h about 19 million lack access to clean water in yemenabdu mohammed yousuf 23 years old one of al dumman village residents located in the north of bajil district of al hodeidah coastal province west of yemen rides a donkey cart for over 20 km daily to get drinking water for his family that consists of 9 members five of them are female and four are male the youngest of them is 3 years old ridding a local made donkey cart the black skin abdu yousuf transfers 12 gallons from his home to a water well located 20 km away of his home and back to his home daily under the heat of the burning sun among long ques the young abdu yousuf waits his turn to fill his gallons with drinking water from a well that was dug and equipped by a wealthy citizen i come here every four days to get safe drinking water abdu yousuf told the center of yemen humanitarian relief and development organization mona during a tour of the region sometimes i wait three hours until my turn comes says abdu yusuf the pumping of water into our house from the state water project has stopped because of the war that broke out and the lack of diesel said abdu yousuf over 15 thousands capita from al dumman and al habil villages benefit from the well that was provided by a wealthy citizen our situations were better before the war we suffer so much now that we go long distances to get water says young abdu yousuf the total of renewable water sources in yemen according to the un water statistics report 2010 is estimated at 3 4 billion cubic meters a year 900 million of which are covered by aquifers each year groundwater levels decrease from 1 7 m with scarcity of recharge due to drought seasons thus water consumption rates exceed natural recharge enormously the yemeni per capita water rate per year is 130 cubic meters while the international water rate per capita is 7500 cubic meters per year according to international organizations yemen is one of the most fragile countries in the world in terms of water security it is possible to take advantage of sea water and desalinate it but the cost is high for a relatively poor country such as yemen an officer in charge stands on the water well to organize long queues of donkey carts young men women line up each in front of his her vehicle until his her turn arrives some of them in school uniform the ninth grade school student ahmad haige 16 years old said he had to organize his time between school and bringing water home i have to skip school 2 days weekly so as to provide drinking water for my family said haige i don t study well i know says haige while smiling and rubbing his

struck a cholera treatment center run by médecins sans frontières doctors without borders msf in yemen the june air strike reportedly did not kill anyone but it destroyed a medical facility that was about to open its doors to cholera patients as ryan goodman explained in the days after the strike saudi arabia provided members of the u s congress an account of the strike that was misleading at best in an email obtained by just security the saudi embassy failed to accept responsibility for the strike and claimed that msf had made an error in not officially informing the coalition of the new treatment facility s location in fact msf asserted that it had notified the saudi coalition of the coordinates of the cholera treatment center twelvetimes the saudi led coalition recently reported its internal assessment of the incident an investigation required by international humanitarian law the report repeatedly attempts to shift the blame for the strike to msf the jiat asserts that after reviewing the satellite imagery it did not find any signs of distinction on the warehouse before the strike a claim contradicted as ryan goodman earlier noted by a researcher with the well respected investigative group bellingcat who found that geolocation and therefore satellite imagery of the cholera treatment center shows that the red crescent logos were even visible from space nonetheless the jiat at points cryptically appears to admit mistakes it states that it became clear that the mission was based on information from a source inside yemen and that it did not complete the necessary procedures used by the coalition forces if that is true if the coalition forces rushed to carry out the strike and therefore failed to complete the necessary procedures used by the coalition forces then this may be a clear incidence of an international humanitarian law violation the jiat however does not accept that responsibility in closing it recommends that coalition states provide voluntary assistance for physical damages to the warehouse emphasis added but if the strike was taken with insufficient precautions as the jiat seems to admit then the assistance would be mandatory not voluntary the recent jiat report on the june attack raises real questions however about the willingness of the coalition to ensure that its air strikes are in compliance with international humanitarian law and about the willingness of the coalition to carry out effective investigations of incidents when they do occur the failure of the coalition to properly vet a targeting location not only implicates the coalition forces in a possible violation of international humanitarian law it also implicates the u s in a possible violation as well common article 1 of the geneva conventions after all provides that states have an obligation not only to respect but to ensure respect of the conventions if the united states is supporting the coalition which it knows to be carrying out strikes that violate international humanitarian law the united states could be violating its own common article 1 obligation to ensure respect of international humanitarian law by oona hathaway comment there are many dozens of such cases b h k inside the largest known u s special forces ground raid in yemen targeting yemen frontlinefrontline s safa al ahmad goes to the site of the largest known u s special forces ground raid in yemen to investigate the escalation of the u s fight against al qaeda in targeting yemen a new documentary that airs jan 22 correspondent safa al ahmad returns to yemen amid an ongoing war to report on american ground raids and drone strikes that have targeted al qaeda she talks to yemeni witnesses and survivors about what they ve experienced eight year old mujahid has a dazzling smile he starts recounting his experience of a u s ground raid on his tiny village in yemen almost like it s a fairy tale one gone terribly wrong they came from far far away there were so many of them each one of them had someone else behind them when a villager asks him what happened to him he replies america mujahid says a block of cement from the roof fell on his back during the raid damaging his back and hearing his uncle was killed for several years the united states has considered the yemeni branch of al qaeda to be one of the most dangerous affiliates of the terrorist group under the trump administration the counter terrorism fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap has escalated despite an ongoing multi front war that has led to what the united nations has called the world s largest humanitarian crisis in targeting yemen frontline correspondent safa al ahmad travels to yemen to visit the sites of american ground raids and drone strikes and speak to witnesses and survivors like mujahid to understand the impact of that escalation on civilians the raid on mujahid s village which took place on may 23 2017 is the largest known u s special forces ground raid in the country the villagers say al ahmad is the first foreign journalist to visit the village since then the people who lived in the village described an apocalyptic scene al ahmad says they were so frightened about the amount of u s soldiers that were sent the helicopters the drones at the time the pentagon said seven terrorists were killed with no civilian casualties a u n investigation later found that five civilians were also killed including an 80 year old man the report said 50 u s soldiers took part in the raid and villagers could not have been aware that only one particular house was being targeted when they attacked the u s forces targeting yemen which airs on jan 22 examines how the u s counter terrorism operation against al qaeda in yemen through drone strikes and ground raids has added to the fear and confusion felt by yemeni civilians in a time of war unfortunately the film in full cannot be looked at in certain countries andwhat the dod says about its operations in yementhe department of defense provided a statement in response to written questions from frontline about u s military operations in yemen and its efforts to avoid civilian casualties on civilian casualtiesthe dod said it maintains a firm commitment to protecting civilians and takes numerous steps to mitigate harm to them including by applying policies and practices that are more protective of civilians than is required as a matter of law including the law of war for all forces pre deployment training includes instruction on the law of war the rules of engagement and policies related to the mitigation of civilian casualties the dod said in the conduct of operations u s forces employ a variety of measures to reduce civilian casualties from operational design to account for where civilians are located on the battlefield to steps taken to mitigate weapon effects on civilians who find themselves near potential targets such as enemy forces lessons we learn in the conduct of operations are used to improve our practices to reduce civilian casualties on the u s role in yemen the united states is committed to finding and striking aqap s terrorist network in yemen it said u s forces conducted multiple ground operations and more than 120 strikes in 2017 to remove key leaders and disrupt the ability of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula and isis yemen to use ungoverned spaces in yemen as a hub for terrorist recruiting training and base of operations to export terrorism worldwide u s forces the dod said are advising and assisting regional counterterrorism partners in the fight against aqap and isis in yemen u s forces have provided our partners with intelligence support airborne isr advice and assistance with operational planning maritime interdiction and security operations medical support and aerial refueling in their efforts to degrade and destroy aqap and isis y it is in our national security interests to pursue violent extremist organizations like aqap and isis y that have attacked u s forces and interests in the region and abroad in order to degrade their ability to conduct further attacks it is also in our interest to support our partners in the region as they pursue al qaeda in the arabian peninsula and isis in yemen as well comment lol b p yemen women war political marginalizationamong many political losses from yemen s national dialogue conference ndc and the houthis takeover of sana a in mid 2014 was the loss of women s political power at the time women secured thirty percent representation in the ndc and took part in the constitution drafting committee for the first time in yemen s history ensuring a thirty percent in any future committee formation yet today in the conflict resolution process yemeni women are almost without any political power at all yemeni women today face the same marginalization of other groups such as the youth and southern secessionist movement who are also absent from the negotiation table women however are doubly excluded as they face gender based marginalization for more than a decade yemen has been the lowest ranking country in the global gender index with a gender gap estimated today to be ninety percent or more nonetheless yemeni women s political activism has continued and received the support of the international community the un special envoy for yemen martin griffiths and his predecessors jamal ben omar and ismail ould cheikh ahmed have ensured women s political participation in peacebuilding processes through creative ways in order to apply over the four rounds of yemen peace talks in kuwait geneva and stockholm women have worked closely with griffiths team in a variety of advisory groups all these groups have compensated for the lack of women s political participation as the warring parties refuse to include sufficient female representation at the negotiation table says one female member speaking on condition of anonymity more however needs to be done says dr najat joma an professor of management and finance at sana a university and a member of the women s pact for peace and security group these groups are a good step but we need an effective women s political participation and both parties have to be pressured to include women in their delegations a creative way to do so suggested by ghanem is to induct women members in these peace talks a political will from the warring parties and the international community to address the political marginalization of women is key for increasing women s political representations in yemen s conflict resolution process meanwhile it is important that yemeni women from all sides of the political spectrum keep playing a central role within the available space by afrah nasser b e k p in damning report un panel details war economy in yemenby benefiting from questionable wartime revenue streams and outright corruption both the houthi rebels and the u s supported hadi government are inhibiting a transition to peace the latest un panel of experts report on yemen raises new red flags about potential threats to near term conflict resolution and stabilization in addition to questioning the cohesiveness of government and rebel forces it anecdotally details the rise of a robust mafia like war economy that creates disincentives for peace on both sides the panel s conclusions include a new particularly damning assessment of abdu rabu mansour hadi s government and its local affiliates while also reiterating extant concerns about the saudi led coalition and the houthi rebels the nearly 300 page document paints a bleak picture drawing particular attention to the lack of cohesiveness that makes it difficult for either hadi or the houthis to decisively win the war let alone effectively transition to peace after all if the disparate factions that make up either side lost the common enemy that binds them together they may well fracture into opposing forces creating a series of small civil wars across the country on one side the hadi government is unable to exert authority over the areas it claims to control its repeated non payment of salaries has contributed to troop discontent and it faces intense and often violent opposition by some southern forces on the other side houthi forces are a similarly loose collective linked together more by a set of common adversaries than common interests the panel suggests there are signs that the houthis are becoming less politically inclusive in their leadership ranks a fact that likely exacerbates the broader lack of cohesion indeed the panel notes that the houthis are facing slightly increasing levels of dissent from major tribes and at the street level recruitment has reportedly taken a hit due to a currency crisis that caused food prices to rise and the practice of offering low pay to hungry poor often illiterate young recruits is hardly a recipe for close knit forces war economy and corruptioncoupled with the lack of cohesiveness various destabilizing factors in yemen have led to the development of a significant war economy inevitably those who benefit from this economy are far less inclined to facilitate a transition to peace and they could act as spoilers if their interests are threatened these elements include many important stakeholders in the north and south some with roles in houthi or hadi governing structures for example to finance the war effort the houthis rely on rents and fees in sana that the government used to collect according to last year s panel report this revenue totaled at least 407 billion yemeni riyals 1 6 billion moreover they collect import taxes at hodeida and al salif ports and at a checkpoint in dhamar province through which nearly all of the country s imports pass even those originating from entry points not under houthi control the panel also notes that the houthis make significant sums by taxing oil donated by iran perhaps tens of millions of dollars per month the oil is imported through hodeida with falsified paperwork suggesting an origin in the united arab emirates or oman though the true origin is iran this allows vessels to avert detection by the coalition or un maritime monitors in addition to funding the houthi war effort the war economy has created ample opportunities for corruption on both sides of the conflict the hadi government and its local affiliates are particularly taken to task in this year s panel report the previous two reports used the word corruption only once but this new edition uses it over twenty times eight times in direct relation to the government two in relation to the houthis and at least nine in relation to both the panel assesses that corruption is contributing to the humanitarian crisis by artificially raising prices and impeding the import of commercial goods at the same time however the panel notes that the houthis are less reliant on iran supplying whole weapons systems suggesting that they are now assembling some systems locally and looking abroad only when they need high value components by elana delozier comment by an us think tank with close ties

freedoms said it monitored 103 assassinations in the city of aden from 2015 to 2018 according to a recent report titled the invisiblekiller the assassinations focused on security men mosque preachers and politicians and operations began 43 days after the restoration of the city of aden from the grip of the houthi militia and the control of the city by the uae forces the geneva based organization said its report on assassinations comes after these facts have been a mystery for some time until the edges of clues that may lead to the truth are revealed sam said that her report relied on the statistics methodology based on the monitoring and documentation of the assassinations during the period specified in the report where the report monitored 103 the facts of the assassination in the province of aden and worked to follow them through the media and to communicate with the families of the victims the concerned and the authorities of human rights and security in an effort to break the mystery of this disturbing crime which has pushed many political and religious leaders to migrate from the city of aden and seek a safe place that is not in the hands of assassinations the report s importance lies in the fact that it is the first qualitative and analytical report highlighting the wave of assassinations that hit the government s interim city of aden for legitimacy with security military and civilian figures for political aims after it was retrieved from houthi militias on july 17 2015 the city of aden and its surrounding areas have undergone the control of the uae forces as part of the arab coalition forces that are waging war in yemen with the aim of entrusting the legitimate government to regain control of the land and end the coup d état carried out by the houthi rebels according to the stated objectives of the coalition according to the report instead of the relative stability the city was supposed to see in preparation for the return of the legitimate government the opposite occurred the security situation deteriorated and the city of aden was ravaged by a wave of assassinations believed to be of a systematic and organized nature targeting certain segments of the military and security and civilians by systematic means which put a number of questions about how the assassinations were carried out and the dubious silence of the security services and forces in control of aden even for issuing a statement explaining what is going on in aden and the beneficiaries of these assassinations that targeted even the first man in the province maj gen jafar mohammed saad december 6 2015 according to sam the largest number of victims is security officers who numbered 42 spread over criminal investigation the political security apparatus the security of aden airport followed by the preachers and imams and the victims 23 including 12 imam and preachers belonging to the salafist current and 4 belonging to the islah party and one preacher belonged to the islamist oriented al nahdha movement the military came fourth with eight people followed by leaders and members of the resistance with seven people in addition to a variety of 14 people including activists athletes professors judges and prosecutors sam confirmed in her report that the wave of assassinations began immediately after the war and then continued b k p trump s yemen problemon yemen the trump administration has tied the worst humanitarian disaster in the world to stopping the spread of iranian influence the crisis in yemen was not the focus of pompeo s cairo speech on january 10 where he mentioned iran at least two dozen times including the promise to expel every last iranian boot from syria pompeo did express support for un efforts to achieve peace in war torn yemen but announced no special us diplomatic initiative toward that end trump has made clear his own focus on iran in his rare statements on yemen the country of iran an official white house release explained is responsible for a bloody proxy war against saudi arabia in yemen on the other hand saudi arabia would gladly withdraw from yemen if the iranians would agree to leave iran certainly supports the houthis in yemen but there is no need to exaggerate its support the house now with a democratic majority is poised to push the measure again likely to be taken up relatively soon after the federal government shutdown ends trump will most likely veto any measure to end us support for the saudi war in yemen that passes both chambers given the numbers a successful veto override is very much in question such an outcome would be an embarrassment for the trump administration and a further impediment to its larger approach to the region the administration s much touted middle east security alliance mesa the closest thing to a trump doctrine first emerged during the president s first visit overseas to saudi arabia saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman mbs presented trump with an arab islamic american conference to showcase his ability to bring arab and islamic countries together behind what he considered to be mutual national security interests mesa sometimes referred to as the arab nato springs from the notion jointly held by saudi arabia and the trump administration that iran is responsible for much of the trouble in the middle east and that it must be countered by land sea and air yemen has thus become a footnote in this grand design and a pawn for regional rivalries the conflict in yemen remains a stubborn one at least as far as a military resolution is concerned in the final analysis the trump administration by giving mbs a pass on khashoggi s murder and refusing to press saudi arabia on the killing of civilians in yemen is giving saudis the impression that they could continue indefinitely with their attempts to defeat the houthis with us support the mesa idea unrealistic though it may be is further encouragement for the arab coalition to seek victory on the battlefield rather than a diplomatic solution in addition to ruining yemen nothing about this war is in the united states national security interests the longer the war goes on the stronger the houthis relationship with iran gets the further widespread is the al qaeda presence and to boot the russians are getting to fill another void left by the united states by inserting themselves into the peacemaking process with their increased contacts with the south of yemen an area with which the soviet union once had a very special relationship when south yemen had a marxist government the only hope for ending the yemen war lies with enough congressional pressure to force the administration s hand to use its military assistance to saudi arabia as leverage actually cutting off all yemen war related help in order to open the way for serious multilateral diplomacy and bring about a solution by nabeel khoury am wichtigsten seuchen most important epidemics b h swine flu now spreading in yemen as health system crumbles under saudi attackflu cases that could otherwise be treated are leaving patients in critical condition and facing death yemen s health officials estimate that 80 percent of those with h1n1 risk death owing to the lack of medication available and yemen s devastated health infrastructure mohammed a father of three died last friday overcome by the symptoms of the swine flu virus two days after being treated in al azal s intensive care unit issam al harazi data officer for epidemiological surveillance at yemen s ministry of health told mintpress news that al rajwai died as a result of a viral infection of his respiratory system likely caused by the h1n1 swine flu virus which affected the cells of his nasal mucosa throat and lungs and then moved to the rest of his body the spokesman for the ministry of health and population in sana a yousef al hathari told mintpress that there have been a total 418 suspected h1n1 cases in and around the province of sana a and in northern yemen over the past two months alone and 86 people have died from the virus though al hathari suspects the number of deaths to be higher as many cases go unreported al hathari went on to say that this week health centers had received 46 cases of swine flu in the secretariat of the capital amran and ibb provinces and 11 deaths which means the virus is likely beginning its spread across the region in fact according to yemen s health ministry the virus is spreading rapidly in many of yemen s provinces al hathari explained that in winter the incidence of influenza is already high and the climate is conducive to the spread of the virus if the virus continues to spread among yemen s vulnerable population it could cause another major health disaster in a country already grappling with a cholera epidemic especially in the absence of vaccines and treatment exacerbated by the saudi led coalition s crippling blockade h1ni colloquially known as the swine flu is a subtype of the common influenza virus prevalent among pigs but transmission of the virus from animals to humans is rare and does not always lead to human infection however when it does develop in humans it carries a significantly higher risk of fatality than the common flu the death of mohammed al rajwai a public sector worker has sparked fear in sana a that the virus will spread especially considering the compromised state of yemen s health infrastructure owing to the ongoing war and the blockade that has been imposed by saudi led coalition we are living in an environment infested with all kinds of viruses thanks to the war said fahd assad a father of four whose sons are still recovering from cholera now i am afraid of swine influenza god help us assad lives in the district of dares

without exposure to many of the infections that frequent large cities but the war has forced people from across rural yemen to flee to sana a seeking shelter from the violence people from outer provinces are now directly connected and more liable than ever before to be exposed to the flu and other infectious diseases officials in sana a told mintpress news that the spread of the h1n1 virus poses a potential for disaster to the population to make matters worse yemen s hospitals suffer from a lack of life saving medicines as a result of the saudi coalition s imposed siege on the country flu cases that could otherwise be treated are leaving patients in critical condition and facing death yemen s health officials estimate that 80 percent of those with h1n1 risk death owing to the lack of medication available and yemen s devastated health infrastructure officials blame the countries of saudi led coalition for the influx of diseases and epidemics that have taken hold in yemen since the war began observers warn of a major health disaster in yemen if the epidemics continue unabated and say international health organizations have been slow to respond unlike mohammed al rajwai few patients admitted to local hospitals with suspected h1n1 cases wind up in intensive care in fact most people who contract the virus are unable to reach a hospital at all as so many have been destroyed in the war for example in the district of ahem a remote area in northern hajjah province the single hospital serving the entire region was leveled by saudi bombs more than three years of near constant airstrikes by saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have left yemen s roads impassable and have turned its hospitals and clinics to rubble while a ruinous blockade of yemen s ports has depleted the country s supplies of life saving medicine the hospitals that have not been destroyed barely function doctors have not been paid and power outages are frequent the u s backed saudi led coalition

yemenis livesthe h1n1 flu also known as swine flu is one of the most common epidemics and diseases of recent days among yemenis the collapse of the health system due to continued aggression and siege

capital sana a recorded the death of more than fifty people infected with the epidemic yemeni hospitals suffer from the lack of life saving medicines because of the siege these flu cases face death and their condition is very critical doctors say 80 percent of cases of h1n1 flu are at risk of dying because of the lack of medication they hold the countries of aggression responsible for diseases and epidemics that takes yemenis lives observers warn of a major health disaster if the epidemics continue to spread especially with the absence of vaccines and special medicines for treatment besides the us saudi aggression targeting of health facilities they criticize the role of health organizations that they have made only promises and a great slow pace of action and responsibility a h 11

ahmadin order to investigate the escalating u s fight against al qaeda in yemen and its impact on civilians al ahmad traveled to drone strike territory to talk to survivors and witnesses unlike the front lines of a conventional battle she says drone strikes are unpredictable making it difficult to calculate which risks to take as a journalist al ahmad also traveled to the sites of two u s ground raids including the navy seal raid that made headlines days after president donald trump was inaugurated one of the survivors of that raid was sheikh abdulillah al dhahab who had not been interviewed about what happened until he spoke to al ahmad al ahmad says she was drawn to this story because the dhahab family featured so heavily in the 2017 ground raid on the village of yakla some members of the family had ties to al qaeda while others joined the sides fighting al qaeda she spoke to frontline about how the family s complexities reflect the complexities of yemen about the dangers she faced and what she hopes viewers take away from the documentary saa i ve been obsessed with the dhahab family for a while and i ve been really interested in trying to find a way to tell their story it didn t end up in the film but tariq the head of the family the brother of abdulillah was the one who declared an islamic state in baydah province and pledged allegiance to al zawahiri and one of his brothers is the one who killed him it was such an epic family drama on an international scale i keep thinking about how to tell the complexities of yemen i thought this story of the family would be a really good way into this the yakla raid just accentuated the prominence of the story it s the most dangerous thing i ve ever done i think professionally i had to make peace with death that s the thing about drone strikes one of my biggest problems when i was interviewing people is that they were afraid to tell the truth not because they wanted to lie but just because they didn t know what would get them into trouble obviously i think yemen is an important story obviously i think if you re going to talk about people you should go talk to them it s just basic respect for other human beings b h k film jemen krieg von stellvertretern mathias tretschog im nuoviso talkmathias tretschog im studio talk mit norbert fleischer die derzeit größte humanitäre katastrophe der welt lässt dem

and analysis of the latest events in the country s four year old civil war which has sparked the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world this is the first update the present context for more than six months the primary focus for diplomats policy makers and analysts working on yemen has been the now frozen offensive on the red sea port city of hodeida recent political and military developments the yemeni government and the huthis have told un special envoy martin griffiths that they do not want to hold a second round of talks originally scheduled for the end of january until progress had been made on the hodeida agreement and griffiths agrees preparations for the next round are continuing with germany kuwait and switzerland mentioned as possible locations fresh momentum cannot come soon enough coalition officials particularly from the united arab emirates uae have warned that if the parties fail to make progress soon on redeployments from hodeida the coalition parties and their yemeni allies will return to hostilities while this could be a tactical move to maintain pressure on the huthis it could well turn into military action if a negative momentum builds for now however coalition officials remain committed to seeing the stockholm agreement implemented even as rival forces have traded accusations of hundreds of ceasefire breaches since the truce was announced on 18 december read more here developments outside of hodeida continue to arouse concern b p cultural poverty in the kingdom of oil why saudi arabia wants yemen deaddescription of research projectthis project focuses on a neglected aspect of the saudi led attack on yemen the dominant accounts have focused on factors related to geostrategy political parties historical animosities internationally tribally and domestically political economy and terrorism the task of this project is to look at the security or the lack of it of the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa in terms of cultural identity saudi society is relatively new the current ksa formerly being the region called hijaz which was made up of mainly nomadic bedouin tribes and one main urban center mecca wahhabism the official branch of islam of the ksa is considered extremist for its belief in an unquestionable obedience to the political ruler and violent jihadism zaydism the religious sect of islam associated with the hashemite clan making up 20 of yemen s population adheres to the notion of ijtihad independent reasoning the houthis against whom the saudis launched their attack on yemen in 2015 are hashemite they had defeated the saudis in the 2009 war begun by saudi arabia against the houthis under virtually the same political conditions as the current war the houthi threat to the ksa also relates to the houthis belief that the right to authority belongs only to hashemites which therefore gives them the right to be the sole authority culturally socially and politically in yemen rich in social cultural and material archaeologically and architecturally history and suffering from agricultural self neglect it stands in stark contrast to the ksa s oil and migrant worker based society what the former lacks in petro dollars the latter lacks in any distinct culture yemen has existed in different political forms for three thousand years the ksa is less than a hundred years old and its oil producing days are coming to a visible end is this why the state has pressured saudis to plot or be creative in genealogical relation to prominent arabian tribes the project s hypothesis is that saudi arabia is intimidated by yemen the poorest country in the arab world this is not limited to the political and the military but extends to social cultural and material and ancient history and to the practice of independent thinking when it comes to interpretation of the qura n research will seek to determine the viability of this idea by looking at the self perception of saudis and the perception of the ksa and yemen by arabs in general is it the case that if the ksa cannot have deep culture that yemen should not either and thus be targets of social and cultural genocide b p why yemen matters to saudi arabia and the westyemen is one of the most populous countries on the arabian peninsula with a population that is 35 percent shia saudi arabia has also been concerned by what it sees as iranian meddling in yemen saudi arabia has worried that the presence of iran in yemen could be risky for sunni order especially along part of its 1 800 kilometer border with yemen from the viewpoint of the saudi authorities such a wide border is seen as the main point of penetration for extremists and terrorists such as al qaeda into saudi arabia you only have to look at the list of detainees at guantanamo bay to know that yemen has been a fruitful recruiting ground for al qaeda in the west s view by controlling yemen through the houthis iran is aiming to increase its strategic and regional influence and is desirous for acceptance of its positions in syria and iraq which is not desirable to the arab western axis in their view the houthis are the iranian forces in yemen and iran is a geopolitical threat to the axis the importance of control over yemen for saudi arabia and the west is obvious instability along saudi s border with yemen seems a threat to the global political and economic order as determined by the west and the saudis k un development programme impacting safety and security in yemen by training 25 yemac staff in mine actionttthe united nations development programme began a mine action training programme for 25 staff from our national implementing partner the yemen executive mine action centre yemac the four week 20 day programme will help build the deminer s capacity in identifying and neutralizing various types of unexploded ordinances commonly found in yemen the training which will run through 14 february has been strategically created around the provision of extensive theoretical and practical modules on various topics including a international mine action standards b proper use of demining and explosive ordinance disposal equipment and c exercises within battle area clearance it has been made possible through the funding of our partners the kingdom of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates and implemented by the the danish demining group a part of the danish refugee council p hrw raises alarm over human rights abuses in egypt and saudi arabia in 2019restrictions on activists journalists and government officials are worsening in tandem with human rights abuses experts sayhuman rights watch says it has been forced to close half its offices in the middle east and north africa mena due to the security or political risks associated with its work in the region while the human rights abuses in those countries have only worsened at the mena section launch of the group s 2019 world report on tuesday hrw s regional experts lamented the fact that their organisation could not hold its annual event in any of the cities where it once had regional offices such as cairo tripoli and sanaa the middle east has become closed to civil society said hrw middle east and north africa director sarah leah whitson in her opening remarks at the event held at london s frontline club many countries in the region such as saudi arabia bahrain and morocco have imposed strict visa restrictions on hrw officials to bar them from entering whitson said this means people s stories and experiences aren t getting told she said b p exploring saudi emiratis disagreements on yementhere was an unwritten agreement between the two countries on the spheres of influence saudi arabia played a role in northern yemen and the uae supported southern groups however in the past three years there has been a great deal of discord between the two countries over the division of influence in yemen and the field defeats the launch of yemeni ballistic missiles towards the uae and saudi arabia have also brought a dispute between the two states when saudi backed exiled president abed rabbo mansour hadi of yemen told the saudi leadership of his desire to return to aden riyadh replied that the emirates were unable to comply with his request because it was not the right timing saudi arabia strongly supports president mansour hadi while the united arab emirates supports the southern transitional council stc which seeks for an independent south yemeni state following the uae objection the pro mansour hadi media and yemeni congregation for reform al islah once again accused the emirates of sabotaging the legal yemeni government emirate media for the first time since the meeting of crown prince of abu dhabi mohammad bin zayed mbz with chairman of the islah party mohammed al yadomi in december resumed wave of attack on yemen s al islah party an emirati state run newspaper akhbar al arab in a report on tuesday accused al islah party of managing the black market on classified information exchange which refers to the operation of the secret information exchange carried out with the help of the army and ansarullah forces according to arab sources al islah party has not functioned as desired by the uae because an important faction of the party is connected to qatar the root of the uae and saudi disagreements in yemenalthough the emirates has participated in the yemeni war in the form of an anti yemeni coalition with saudi arabia the field evidence suggests that the uae s ties to riyadh are not very large in the yemeni arena and even the uae is now reluctant to win saudi arabia because saudi arabia unlike its dealings with abu dhabi the pro uae elements have been marginalized and even fired by the cabinet in the undercover government of yemen the discord between the two countries is enormous but the close relationship between saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman mbs and the crown prince of abu dhabi mbz prevented the conflict escalation however the differences will come to the surface in due course of time the discord over the muslim brotherhoodthe muslim brotherhood and its role in southern yemen have always been one of the major areas of conflict between saudi arabia and the uae although riyadh has repeatedly tried to resolve this issue in a variety of ways the uae still considers the muslim brotherhood an obstacle in southern yemen the meeting between mbs and mbz with the muslim brotherhood authorities in december 2017 sparked speculation of potential dispute resolution between the yemeni muslim brotherhood and abu dhabi though emirati s media stance soon removed the speculation dispute over the breakup of yementhe disintegration of yemen is the second issue between riyadh and abu dhabi the economic importance of southern yemen for the uae has led the country to pursue the division of the region and to do so abu dhabi fully supports the southern transitional council headed by aidarus al zoubaidi in fact in the yemeni crisis first and foremost the uae seeks to stabilize southern yemen to keep the flow of free trade in the strait of bab al mandab and the surrounding area of aden thus abu dhabi will prefer the breakup of yemen if the stc gets to have the upper hand by mohammad ghaderi b k p film carla ortiz war live we have few days to help yemenies to understand

beijing reuters china will take steps to spur growth amid a trade war with the united states but there is limited room for aggressive stimulus in an economy already laden with massive debts and a property market prone to credit driven spikes policy insiders said china s deepening economic slowdown has fanned market expectations of a big spending binge especially if the bruising tariff war with washington escalates intensifying pressure on chinese jobs threatening social stability such a move plans for which have repeatedly been denied by china s top leaders would come at a price however similar moves in the past have quickly juiced growth rates but also buried the world s no 2 economy under a mountain of debt the room for a strong stimulus is not big and there are very big risks because that will rely on a flood of cash and increased leverage in the economy said a policy insider declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter during the 2008 09 global financial crisis beijing rolled out a 4 trillion yuan spending package to fight a downturn that cost 20 million jobs in a matters of months quickly reviving growth but also prompting a credit explosion the obsession of china s leaders with stability led to policy easing in 2012 and 2015 a year marked by a stock market crash a slide in the yuan and sharp capital outflows that further pushed up debt levels and inflated home prices authorities have taken a raft of pro growth measures in the past year in the form of cuts to the levels of cash banks must hold as reserves to spur lending tax cuts and efforts to accelerate infrastructure spending still growth in the world s second largest economy weakened to a 28 year low of 6 6 percent in 2018 and is expected to slow further to 6 3 percent this year sources have told reuters that beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6 6 5 percent this year from around 6 5 percent in 2018 some chinese factories have felt the pinch from higher us tariffs but there are few signs of a sharp rise in unemployment due to a more resilient services sector and a shrinking pool of workers as a result of the country s demographic changes we should be vigilant about employment pressure but it s too early to talk about serious problems said a second policy insider the current slowdown was caused by china s deleveraging drive in early 2016 which focused on state firms and local governments before broadening to the financial sector a year later a crackdown on shadow lending pushed up borrowing costs and made it harder for small firms to get funds as the trade war increases headwinds beijing s policy focus has been shifted to supporting growth from reining in debt risks although top leaders remain worried about long term systemic risks that could derail the country s economic ascent president xi jinping said this week that china must be on guard against black swan risks meaning unforeseen events that have extreme consequences while fending off so called grey rhino events obvious threats that go ignored data from the bank for international settlements bis showed that china s debt to gross domestic product gdp ratio climbed to 253 percent at the end of june 2018 from 231 percent at end 2015 although the pace of increases is slowing fitch could cut china s a credit rating or stable outlook if beijing reverts to the kind of debt fueled stimulus programs it has used in the past the firm s top sovereign analyst said earlier this month further reductions in banks reserve requirement ratios rrr are expected in coming quarters but the central bank will not rush into cutting benchmark interest rates more aggressive easing could pressure the yuan aggravate high debt levels and even stoke property speculation given that elevated home prices have put strains on consumers if there is too much liquidity we should worry whether it may flow into unintended areas rather than the real economy said a policy adviser no quick boost to growth china is likely to lean more on fiscal pump priming to support the economy this year as the central government has been struggling to channel more credit into small and private firms that are vital for growth and jobs policy insiders said in december top leaders pledged to step up counter cyclical support for the economy and said fiscal policy would be more forceful and effective and monetary policy would be prudent with appropriate tightness and looseness details on the fiscal stimulus are expected to be unveiled during the annual parliamentary meeting in march analysts expect china to deliver tax and fee cuts of 2 trillion yuan in 2019 versus last year s 1 3 trillion yuan and let local governments issue 2 trillion yuan in off budget special bonds to fund key projects up from 1 35 trillion yuan but the economy may not get a quick boost as the raft of policy measures may take time to kick in and china s high debt levels and falling investment returns could slow down spending stimulus won t be very strong and its impact won t be big said one of the policy insiders the manufacturing sector faces all round oversupply while infrastructure investment is saturated in many places projects that have been launched won t make money new tax cuts including lowering the valued added tax vat for firms could give hard pressed small and private firms a shot in the arm and force the government to tighten its belt the finance ministry has pledged a 5 percent cut in general government spending
haarp the high frequency active auroral research program was initiated as an ionospheric research program established in 1993 in gakona alaska and operated by the university of alaska fairbanks it was and is funded by the u s air force the u s navy the university of alaska fairbanks and the defense advanced research projects agency darpa its alleged purpose was to analyze the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance haarp is a high power high frequency transmitter used for study of the ionosphere that is the official version haarp was supposed to be shut down in may 2014 but then it was decided that the facility would be transferred to the university of alaska in reality this sophisticated research project owned by the military and most probably with cia hands in it is continuing in some secret location working on ionospheric enhancement technologies to be used to influence weather patterns in fact to weaponize weather the first known occasion when the us air force used high power high frequency transmitters was to influence the intensity and duration of the monsoon during the vietnam war in the 1960s the idea was to render the transition of the vietcong from north to south vietnam on their jungle paths more difficult or impossible through extended heavy rains to what extent this attempt was successful is not known however since then research has evolved and it is now possible to influence weather patterns throughout the world in other words to create droughts floods storm hurricanes wherever such weather phenomena are convenient for the purposes of empire and its vassals talk about man made climate change imagine the amount of money that can be generated by such unsuspicious weather modifications let alone the amount of human suffering famine despair chaos economic collapse eventually entire segments of populations can be wiped out and all will be attributed to climate change which are claimed to be man made due to our civilization s excessive co2 emissions man made indeed extensive and prolonged changes in weather patterns can have devastating economic impacts the pampas stretching over some 750 000 km2 is one of south america s most fertile region covering argentina s norther tier from the atlantic to the andes and also all of uruguay and part of southern brazil the area was struck in 2017 2018 by one of the harshest droughts in the last 10 years severely curtailing argentina s main staple wheat corn soybean and beef argentina is the world s third largest exporter of soybean and corn argentina was counting on record agricultural yields that would contribute significantly to the expected 3 5 gdp growth in 2018 instead 2018 agricultural exports are expected to be reduced by some us 3 5 billion this is expected to result in a cut of gdp growth by at least 1 to 1 5 not counting agriculture related industries that will suffer losses many of which may have to close and thereby also increasing unemployment and human misery the neoliberal mauricio macri who came to power in december 2015 as an implant by washington has already devastated the country by drastic austerity programs combined with severe tariff increases for public and social services i e transportation electricity fuel water supply as well as health and education the country is in shambles with an unemployment rate officially hovering around 10 but in reality it is more like 20 to 25 the poverty rate increased under macri s dictatorship to about 35 from about 15 in november 2015 before macri came to power strikes and social protests abound there is not one week without social unrest which drives the country further into the ground like the yellow vests in france who want to oust president macron argentinians want to get rid of macri in comes the imf which has recently published a devastating report about argentina s state of the economy it predicts a grim scenario with rising interest rates on argentina s mostly dollar denominated debt triggering local money production and a predicted inflation of 40 a continuous loss of purchasing power hurting especially the poor and average income earners prompting more social unrest a vicious downward spiral in june 2018 the imf invited by macri to the rescue followed its usual recipe of more debt and more austerity the scenario looks pretty similar to what happened in 2010 2011 and forward in greece just on a much larger scale at least by a factor of 5 over a 3 year period in argentina the imf agreed to a standby credit of us 50 billion the largest in the imf s history with a tranche of us 15 billion to be drawn immediately however in september 2018 the peso crashed under the burden of debt and inflation and argentina faced insolvency no problem the imf came to the rescue with an additional us 13 4 billion bringing the total for 2018 to us 28 3 billion greece s first bailout tranche in 2010 which was 20 billion us 22 6 billion at today s exchange rate that the imf repeats greek mistake in argentina is of course a joke this is not a mistake this is calculated greed administered to the people of argentina usurpation at its worst argentina is a much larger and richer country much more almost infinitely more can be extracted from her economy than from greece s and argentina has been primed by a complacent president put in place by those financial oligarchs intent to milk argentina to the bones would it therefore be surprising if the argentine economic disaster and consequently the imf rescue action was helped a bit by climate change à la haarp
via outline remember the subprime mortgage mess 1 2 trillion in risky corporate debt is flashing similar warning signs indebted borrowers increasingly take out high interest adjustable rate loans that are packaged into securities and sold to investors eager for a better rate of return everything s fine while the economy is growing but when it slows those borrowers could default causing problems to cascade through the financial system if this all sounds like the subprime housing market in the boom years before the 2008 financial crisis you re right and that s what increasingly has regulators lawmakers ratings agencies and some market watchers worried los angeles times this time however the borrowers in this credit bubble aren t homeowners taking out mortgages they re hundreds of u s companies with weaker credit ratings many of them well known like uber and burger king taking out so called leveraged loans those loosely regulated loans often are used to fund corporate deal making but those deals known as leveraged buyouts can go bad because of the large debt load as happened with the demise last year of toys r us combined there is about 1 15 trillion in outstanding u s leveraged loans a record that is double the level five years ago and those loans increasingly are being made with less protection for lenders and investors any fair minded look at the leveraged loan market should cause significant alarm by anybody concerned about financial stability and the inevitable upcoming economic downturn said dennis kelleher president of better markets a group that advocates stricter financial regulation you put all these pieces together it s a witches brew the risks aren t nearly as widespread as they were during the housing bubble when the percentage of all mortgages that were subprime jumped to about 20 leveraged loans while growing rapidly account for less than 5 of the more than 42 trillion u s fixed income debt market which also includes corporate and municipal bonds still the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of the currency the bank of england the international monetary fund and the bank for international settlements a consortium of 60 central banks all have raised concerns recently about the growth of the leveraged loan market and the potential risks to the financial system in an economic slowdown former federal reserve chairwoman janet l yellen went public this fall with her worries about what she called a huge deterioration in the standards for those loans which make it easier for indebted companies to take on more debt if we have a downturn in the economy there are a lot of firms that will go bankrupt i think because of this debt she told the financial times it would probably worsen a downturn and presumed democratic presidential candidate sen elizabeth warren d mass is pressing u s regulators for answers about oversight of the market i am concerned that the large leveraged lending market exhibits many of the characteristics of the pre 2008 subprime mortgage market she wrote in a november letter to key regulatory agencies even jamie dimon chief executive of jpmorgan chase co who last week dismissed concerns that the leveraged loan market represented a potential systemic risk warned that there could be problems for some lenders outside the conventional banking system someone s going to get hurt there dimon said on a tuesday earnings call referring to leveraged loan losses if a recession hits toys r us loaded up on leveraged loan debt when it was purchased in a leveraged buyout in 2005 by private equity firms bain capital and kkr co and real estate investment trust vornado realty trust the debt burden led the toy retailer to file for bankruptcy protection in 2017 after it was unable to refinance the debt burger king used a 6 75 billion leveraged loan to help fund its 2014 purchase of tim horton s the canadian coffee and doughnut chain and uber last year raised 1 5 billion in its second leveraged loan issuance following a 1 15 billion one in 2017 according to the wall street journal leveraged loans in and of themselves aren t bad they are simply a credit instrument employed with companies that already have a lot of debt and those firms are fairly common about two thirds of u s companies have enough debt that independent credit raters have them categorized as a higher risk to repay than companies with so called investment grade ratings which makes them off limits to many institutional investors because those companies with non investment grade ratings are highly leveraged the chances are greater that they won t pay back a loan for that reason the interest rate needs to be higher to offset that risk the higher interest rate makes the loans desirable to investors seeking a greater return on their money the fed s benchmark federal funds rate is now at a range between 2 25 and 2 5 the yield on 10 year treasury bills is about 2 8 but yields on leveraged loans can be higher than 10 if an investor buys into the riskiest and most speculative segment of the market safer leveraged loans can still pay several points higher than a treasury bill in those ways leveraged loans are similar to the junk bonds that became popular in the 1980s and fueled corporate deals but there s an important difference we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us junk bonds those rated below investment grade by ratings companies are securities that are traded under the oversight of the securities and exchange commission leveraged loans are basically private transactions between lenders and borrowers so they are not regulated by the sec however bank regulators do keep tabs on the underwriting standards and outstanding loan totals of banks to make sure if loans go sour they won t have to step in and rescue the institutions which is what happened during the financial crisis and they are starting to raise flags in its semiannual risk report issued last month the office of the comptroller of the currency which regulates national banks said it remains attentive to the heightened risks in the corporate bond and loan markets and in particular the leveraged lending market and in its financial stability report in november the fed said that although default rates for leveraged loans remained low credit standards for new leveraged loans appear to have deteriorated over the past six months the share of newly issued large loans to companies with high ratios of debt to adjusted earnings has increased in recent quarters and now exceeds previous peak levels observed in 2007 and 2014 when underwriting quality was notably poor the fed report said you have the leveraged loan market growing at a very rapid clip at the same time the standards are dropping he said the leveraged loan market is flashing red warning lights all over the place those are warren s concerns as well she said in her november letter that federal regulators appointed by president trump appear to have backed off guidance issued in 2013 by obama appointed regulators urging banks to use tougher underwriting standards for leveraged loans federal reserve chairman jerome h powell has expressed less concern saying in september that the direct risk to banks from leveraged loans is limited because of restrictions on their lending now in place that market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis he said but it s also true that excessive risk taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy if there s overheating and that kind of thing in those markets so we monitor that carefully however there is a concern that with regulated banks offering fewer such loans there is less oversight of the leveraged lending market in general the share of leveraged loans offered by large banks has declined from about 80 in 2010 to about 54 this year while the share of those loans offered by small banks and nonbanks has increased to about 46 this year among the lenders outside the banking system making leveraged loans are private equity firms hedge funds and insurance companies lenders package these loans into securities called collateralized loan obligations that are sold to investors freeing them up to make more loans what s more these loans increasingly are being offered with fewer restrictions on repayment making them more attractive than junk bonds as a source of corporate financing because the loan market got so attractive we ended up seeing a lot more companies going to the loan market said christina padgett head of leveraged finance research at ratings firm moody s investors service companies can borrow a bunch of money relatively affordably do what they want to do with relatively little constraints and still service their debt further fueling the growth in leveraged loans were the near zero interest rates put in place by federal reserve officials during and after the great recession to try to spur economic growth the effect of those low rates rippled through the financial system they lowered the cost of borrowing to make it more attractive to companies seeking to make acquisitions or refinance their debt even if they had to take out a leveraged loan the low rates set by the fed also made owning a piece of a leveraged loan a more attractive investment that paid a higher return than other debt instruments it also came with the promise of adjusting up when the fed began lifting its own benchmark rate investors are desperate for yield we ve seen this show before so they re not demanding a lot in terms of investor protections said sheila bair who headed the federal deposit insurance corp during the financial crisis you lower interest rates on safe assets these are the incentives you get concerns also have been raised about a ruling last year by a three judge panel of the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia that removed a regulatory restriction on collateralized loan obligations the 2010 dodd frank financial reforms sought to reduce the sale of risky investments by requiring firms that package loans into securities to retain a 5 stake in the investment the loan syndications and trading assn a leveraged lending industry group filed suit arguing the requirement could limit funding the group notes that leveraged loans make up a small percentage of the u s fixed income debt market and the overall default rates on leveraged loans are low just 1 6 late last year and forecast by fitch ratings to fall to 1 5 at the end of this year fed monetary policy makers estimated in december that they would enact two more small hikes in their key interest rate this year although powell said recently that they would be patient and flexible as they monitor the economy higher rates would put more pressure on the leveraged loan market but a sharp economic downturn could lead the fed to lower rates which would ease the pressure when you re this late in the business cycle you have pretty much already lent to every creditworthy borrower kelleher said the real question is how much lending do you want to give to marginal non creditworthy borrowers
gold prices eye fed rate decision and us china trade talks next gold forecast talking points gold price outlook for next week is neutral as uncertainty surrounding the fed and us china trade deal leaves risks balanced usd may turn higher if fed walks back its recent dovish position or markets witness further deterioration of the eurozone s economy any resolution or positive development over the trade war could bolster sentiment but may also push usdcnh lower if the offshore yuan rallies gold was able to recover over the last 5 days of trading after incurring losses in the prior week the gains in gold this week came from friday s nearly 1 5 percent surge in the commodity likely attributable to weakness in the us dollar looking for a technical perspective on gold check out the weekly gold technical forecast spot gold price chart 5 minute time frame january 21 2019 to january 25 2019 gold could have been pushed higher with help from chatter at the 2019 world economic forum held in davos switzerland at the conference some global leaders painted a dim picture about future prospects as several geopolitical threats steer investors towards anti risk assets looking ahead to next week markets will closely turn their attention to the federal reserve s first fomc meeting of the year for insight over the central bank s monetary policy decisions if chairman jerome powell echoes the dovish tone fed officials have been communicating since their last policy meeting gold could perform nicely as a lower interest rate environment typically bodes well for the zero yielding asset this effect could be amplified if inflation heats up and starts overshooting expectations additionally china s trade team will be making a visit to the white house as officials aim to make progress over the ongoing sino american trade war any positive development is likely to help boost market sentiment and send risk assets like stocks higher however if the us and china move closer to an agreement the offshore yuan could appreciate against the dollar which generally benefits gold consequently the outcomes from the fed s meeting and us china trade war talks are likely to dictate which direction the price of gold moves next also worth noting is the anticipated release of key indicators that were previously delayed due to the us government shutdown after president trump announced a bipartisan stopgap funding bill agreement to reopen the government through february 15 today a slew of economic indicators look to shed light on america s fundamental backdrop as other countries around the world report disappointing data be sure to check out the dailyfx economic calendar for a full list of upcoming data releases and event risk written by rich dvorak junior analyst for dailyfx follow on twitter richdvorakfx check out our education center for more information on currency forecasts and trading guides other weekly fundamental forecast australian dollar forecast australian dollar may look past cpi report for the fed and us data british pound forecast positive backdrop bullish outlook us dollar forecast us dollar torn between domestic strength global headwinds
the u s backed a coup in venezuela that has failed and president trump was the architect of it this is a farce surrounding an intrigue contained within a tragedy what has happened in venezuela is tragic nicolas maduro is a comical figure straight out of central casting for a south american leader of a junta but it has been the u s s designs on venezuela s oil and gas reserves the largest proven in the world as of 2017 that is the real story behind this week s events for anyone still harboring doubts as to who trump truly is venezuela should end them trump s energy dominance policy is at the core of his foreign policy and he will do whatever it takes to secure that policy and deliver a long standing order to the u s and european oligarchy to gain control over venezuela energy dominance as alistair crooke succinctly put it last year at strategic culture the us were energy dominance to succeed simply would control the tap to the economic development or its lack thereof for rivals china and asia and the us could squeeze russia s revenues in this way too in short the us could put a tourniquet on china s and russia s economic development plans is this why jcpoa was revoked by president trump here then is the squaring of that circle more us power yet less empire trump s us aims for domination not through the globalists permanent infrastructure of the us defence umbrella but through the smart leveraging of the us dollar and financial clearing monopoly by ring fencing and holding tight us technology and by dominating the energy market which in turn represents the on off valve to economic growth for us rivals in this way trump can bring the troops home and yet america keeps its hegemony military conflict becomes a last resort most of trump s supporters refuse to admit this is the plan they still want to believe that national security advisor john bolton and secretary of state mike pompeo were thrust upon him by the nefarious deep state and that trump is a trapped hero in a cage yearning to breathe free and maga if we just support him a little more nonsense legacy of ashes the h tim weiner best price 2 13 buy new 8 95 as of 06 40 utc details trump has been very clear about this policy for years we take over these places kill the bad people and pay for it all by stealing their natural resources in this case oil it is trump s 17th century view on trade writ large since this is a 17th century colonial mindset an independent venezuela even if it is run by an incompetent bus driver is something that cannot be allowed to stand anyone that refuses to trade that oil on u s controlled exchanges exchanges controlled by goldman sachs or in u s dollars is to be taken over and a puppet government installed c f iraq libya but only after your production is removed from the market so that we can sell ours this is geopolitics 101 folks nothing new under the sun does everyone not remember trump s cutting venezuela from the global monetary system through sanctions last year the socialism bogey the worst of the country s hyper inflation occurred after this sadly it was cheered on by libertarians and conservatives more interested in proving socialism is bad than seeing the bigger picture of how it was fomented by immoral u s policy under trump s guidance because no one f cks with the orange jesus man whoa maduro s attempts to rebuild venezuela s monetary system outside of the control of the u s s dominance of financial markets are a blueprint for resisting energy dominance whether maduro s petro cryptocurrency and sovereign bolivar succeed are irrelevant what s important is that he has gained the backing of both china and russia in support of the scheme they are all along with iran committed to an alternate path to trump s energy dominance they have to be because the u s will not stop locking down the world financial system around oil until stopped practically and trump has to continue on the path he s on if he believes in america s inherent greatness which he does and quash them with everything in his power so now he is taking on the weakest link venezuela a country softened up by chavez s idiocy and maduro s incompetence but it took the u s leaning on them through ruinous sanctions to destroy what was left and ensure the collapse of its oil industry so ours can thrive then we blame the venezuelan people for resisting our edicts and electing the wrong man the official cia manua melton h keith best price 4 20 buy new 9 99 as of 12 00 utc details this is the john bolton blueprint for

spectre of socialism is all it takes especially now with the democrats and the media championing our own female che alexandria ocasio cortez as the bogeyfem if that fails and it looks like it has then threaten to invade on humanitarian grounds the only way this works with a u s population weary of two straight decades of war is for things to get so bad our intervention makes us look like the savior of a blighted people the good guy blueprint guess what this is the exact groundwork bolton is laying for iran squeeze them until they pop and then back a coup by the mujahadeen al khaq mek who like guaidó have absolutely zero support within iran and would be the exact antithesis of what the iranian people would want in other words shah 2 0 and are both some flavor of communist just like maduro but don t tell the magapedes this it ll make them cry this is why we refused to work with venezuela and sanctioned them instead maybe the reason maduro wouldn t work with us is because he knew what the ultimate plan was but the real tragedy here is that trump has now embraced interventionist foreign policy completely he s like arnold s character in james cameron s true lies when his impossibly how wife finds out who he truly is she asks him have you ever killed anyone and he quips like a little boy yeah but they were all bad this is how he s selling this betrayal of his base and maga

industry to maintain the fiction that we can outproduce the russians on a price per barrel basis venezuela with a currency which trades outside the swift system can and will produce oil at far lower prices than u s frackers in the permian basin can and it can drive domestic wealth generation again the last part is what he s selling to the maga crowd bringing the troops home but trump said this morning he doesn t rule out military intervention in venezuela to oust maduro from power what happened to no regime change and bringing the military empire to an end oj as long as all of the above works he will be able to substitute the troops overseas for control of the flow of energy except where the bad guys need to be killed of course the failure is complete look around you do you really

central banks may be about to face one of their biggest challenges yet global economic growth is slowing but they have struggled to build up their policy arsenals since the last crisis to effectively deal with another one the us china trade war worries about britain s imminent departure from the european union a potential recession in italy and unrest in south america all pose risks for the global economy while the us federal reserve embarked on its current tightening cycle back in december 2015 the european central bank bank of england and bank of japan still have interest rates at or near rock bottom policymakers want to start raising borrowing costs so they have more room to manoeuvre if there is another downturn but they risk fanning the slowdown hundreds of economists polled by reuters this month think is already underway central banks are also facing increasing pressure from governments to keep policy loose bringing their independence into question us president donald trump has taken a swipe at the fed italy has put pressure on the ecb to extend its asset purchases and indian prime minister narendra modi has made it clear to the reserve bank of india that he wants stimulative monetary policy ahead of national elections in may with the global economy likely to slow over the coming quarters it seems more likely that central banks will continue to come under fire from populist leaders said neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics but most central banks target inflation not growth tighter policy usually strengthens currencies while reducing consumer and business spending which should keep inflation lower but it also risks curtailing what is pretty scant growth in many countries the bank of japan has been targeting inflation of 2 percent for years without success it is not expected to start normalizing its extremely loose monetary policy until 2020 or later ecb president mario draghi may also have to wait a long time before policy is tightened he acknowledged on thursday that growth in the euro zone was likely to be weaker than previously expected although the bank stuck to its guidance that it intends to raise interest rates later this year for the first time in a decade it is now expected to wait until the fourth quarter to raise its deposit rate however later than thought a month ago only 36 of 65 economists polled by reuters this month were confident the ecb would be able to raise rates before the next downturn the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties draghi told a news conference citing trade and geopolitical threats emerging market volatility and brexit britain is due to leave the european union in a little over two months but there is still huge uncertainty about what relationship the two sides will have come brexit day on march 29 published in daily times january 27th 2019

last month fpl closed on the purchase of the city of vero beach s municipal electric system we look forward to extending fpl s value proposition to vero beach s approximately 35 000 customers while also generating significant long term savings for fpl s existing customers the benefit to both new and existing customers is reflective of fpl s collaborative efforts with city local and regional leaders as well as other state authorities to find the best outcome for all stakeholders earlier this month we were pleased to close on the purchase of gulf power and excited to welcome our new colleagues to the nextera energy family we ve now successfully completed all three transactions with southern company that we announced in the middle of last year the acquisitions are an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand nextera energy s regulated business mix through the addition of attractive electric and natural gas franchises by executing on the same long term strategy that we ve deployed at fpl we expect the acquisitions to benefit customers shareholders and the florida economy the energy resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2018 the renewables origination success was particularly strong as the team added approximately 6 500 megawatts including storage and repowering to our backlog over the past year this represents the most successful origination year in our history and is nearly twice as many megawatts as we originated in 2017 our prior record year our ongoing renewable origination success results from operating in what we believe to be the best renewables development environment in our history and our ability to leverage energy resources competitive advantages these competitive advantages include our best in class development skills strong customer relationships purchasing power best in class construction expertise resource assessment capabilities strong access to and cost of capital advantages and the ability to combine wind solar and battery storage into integrated nearly firm low cost products during the year we were pleased to receive the irs started construction guidance on the solar itc which we believe positions us well for substantial solar and storage growth well into the next decade in 2018 more than 40 of the solar projects that were added to our backlog included a battery storage component highlighting the beginning of the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution with continued technology improvements and cost declines we expect that without incentives wind is going to be a 0 02 to 0 025 per kilowatt hour product and solar is going to be a 0 025 to 0 03 per kilowatt hour product early in the next decade combining these extremely low costs with a 0 05 to 0 75 ph adder for a four hour storage system will create a nearly firm renewable generation resource that is cheaper than the operating cost of coal nuclear and less fuel efficient oil and gas fired generation units we continue to believe that this will be massively disruptive to the nation s generation fleet and creates significant opportunities for renewables growth well into the next decade consistent with our focus on growing our rate regulated and long term contracted business operations during the fourth quarter nextera energy transmission announced an agreement to acquire trans bay cable a 53 mile high voltage direct current underwater transmission cable system with utility rates set by ferc which provides approximately 40 of san francisco s daily electric power needs subject to regulatory approvals the approximately 1 billion acquisition including the assumption of debt is expected to close later this year and to be immediately accretive to earnings the proposed acquisition combined with the midcontinent independent system operator selection of nextera energy transmission to develop the approximately 20 miles single circuit 500 kv hartburg sabine junction transmission line in east texas furthers our goal of creating america s leading competitive transmission company in addition to successfully growing our regulated operations both organically and through acquisitions during 2018 we further strengthened energy resources existing portfolio during the year in december the connecticut department of energy and environmental protection selected approximately 20 of the seabrook nuclear plants generation and 80 megawatts of new solar projects which are not yet included in our backlog for long term contracts by operating one of the top performing nuclear plants in the nation energy resources expects to provide significant amounts of carbon free energy at prices generally in line with current forward curves while generating attractive shareholder returns as a result seabrook s contract pricing is expected to be roughly 50 lower than the cost of offshore wind generating significant savings for connecticut customers over the eight year contract term the seabrook award complements energy resources exited the merchant business which we began back in 2011 and essentially completed in 2016 with the sale of our forney lamar and marcus hook natural gas generation assets excluding seabrook the remaining merchant generation assets contribute less than 1 of nextera energy s consolidated adjusted ebitda going forward we expect this contribution to decline as the focus remains on regulated and long term contracted opportunities in renewables natural gas pipelines and regulated transmission as always we will continue to opportunistically evaluate recycling capital through sales of non strategic assets in our portfolio including the remaining fossil generation assets to fund the additional growth of the long term contracted businesses as a result of increasing the expected adjusted earnings contribution from rate regulated businesses to roughly 70 and the steps that we ve taken to further derisk the energy resources portfolio s p announced earlier this month that they reside revised their assessment of nextera energy s business risk profile upward from strong to excellent as a result of this improvement s p reduced nextera energy s ffo to debt downgrade threshold from 23 to 21 this follows moody s announcements last year that with the expansion of the company s regulated operations to roughly 70 following the gulf power transaction nextera energy s cfo pre working capital to debt downgrade threshold would be reduced from 20 to 18 at these revised rating agency thresholds and following some utilization of balance sheet capacity for the trans bay transmission acquisition we now expect to maintain billion to 6 billion of excess balance sheet capacity through to 2021 while we have multiple alternatives for utilization we expect to use approximately 2 billion of this capacity in the near term to support additional regulated capital investments at fbl consistent with the significant incremental smart investment opportunities that exist at fpl last week we announced fpl s groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan to install more than 30 million solar panels by 2013 resulting in an incremental 10 000 megawatts of solar projects versus what is in operation at fpl today we will give further details on these and other potential investments which are mostly expected to help maintain our long term adjusted eps compound annual growth rate beyond 2021 at our investor conference which we plan to hold on june 20th in new york city following the strong results from 2018 i continue to believe that we have one of the best organic opportunity sets in execution track records in the industry i remain as enthusiastic as ever about our long term prospects and based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses i will be disappointed if we were not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6 to 8 compound annual growth rate range through 2021 plus the expected yield accretion from the florida transactions while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings let me now turn to nep which also had a terrific year of execution in 2018 as john will describe later in the call nep successfully delivered on its growth objectives for adjusted ebitda cafd and lp distributions during the year we recycled the proceeds from the sale of nep s canadian portfolio into a higher yielding us portfolio that benefits from a more favorable tax position as a result of this accretive transaction nep extended its expectations for 12 to 15 per year dpu growth by one additional year to 2023 the 1 4 gigawatt renewable portfolio that was acquired from energy resources further enhanced the diversity of nep s existing portfolio and was financed through a combination of the canadian asset sale proceeds and a 750 million convertible equity portfolio financing with blackrock the financing demonstrates nep s ability to excess to access additional low cost sources of capital to finance its growth and with the right to convert a minimum of 70 of the portfolio financing into nep units issued at no discount the transaction further reduces nep s equity needs going forward nep grew the lp distribution by 15 year over year and delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 4 in 2018 which is on the heels of a total unitholder return of over 75 the year prior nep outperformed both the s p 500 and the other yield curves by 7 on average and its total unitholder return was more than 15 higher than the alerian mlp index i continue to believe that the combination of nep s growth visibility along with its flexibility to finance that growth offer unitholders an attractive invest offer unitholders an attractive investor value proposition for these reasons nep is well positioned to continue executing on its growth objectives and delivering strong performance going forward before turning the call over to john i d like to announce some important organizational changes armando pimentel president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources and president and a member of the board of directors of nextera energy partners will retire from each of these positions on march 1 of this year as part of a planned leadership succession process that began when armando shared his plans with me more than a year ago john ketchum currently executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy will replace armando as president and chief executive officer at nextera energy resources as part of john s new responsibilities he will continue to serve as a member of the board of directors of nep and will be appointed president of nextera energy partners rebecca kujawa currently vice president of business management in nextera energy resources will succeed john as executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy rebecca will also become a member of the board of directors of nep each of these changes will become effective on march 1 of this year armando has been an enormous contributor to nextera energy s success during his more than 10 years with the company helping to build an industry leading business during his tenure as ceo of energy resources his leadership his commercial judgment his financial discipline have all guided energy resources through a period of truly unprecedented growth and financial success armando s contribution set the company on a path to become what it is today the world s leading renewable energy company he s been a great friend colleague and a truly valued counselor to me personally and it s an understatement to say i ll miss him but i am also excited for armando and what will come next for him and his family in retirement with regard to john s promotion i ve had the chance to work closely with john for more than 16 years as he has successfully progressed through a variety of different roles in our company we re fortunate to have a person of his capability vision and experience he s an exceptional leader who s emerged as one of the premier cfos in our sector and i have tremendous faith that john is the ideal successor to lead the energy resources team into the future due to his strong financial acumen knowledge of the sector and passion for building a world leading energy company likewise rebecca has distinguished herself as a well rounded executive with a proven track record of execution outstanding finance and commercial skills and an unparalleled understanding of nextera energy of the nextera energy enterprise she s been instrumental in helping armando lead energy resources and develop our strategy for nep over the last several years and here in her innovative analytical and strategic mindset will serve us well in her new role i m very happy to have rebecca as our new chief financial officer i ll now turn the call call over to armando who d like to make some personal remarks armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc thank you jim first i want to thank jim for providing me the opportunity to lead energy resources for the 7 5 years and i want to thank those of you on the phone today who i ve had the privilege of meeting and interacting with since i began at nextera energy in 2008 i thank you for the interactive dialog and the opportunity to continue to tell our story and today there is no doubt that energy resources is not only the largest developer operator and owner of renewable energy in the world but also it s most profitable and innovative and as i tell our employees and customers i believe we are just getting started i strongly believe that the renewable energy opportunity is actually just beginning the combination of energy storage with wind and solar is a revolution which will expand the opportunities for renewables and is very exciting and profoundly comfortable in the continued success of energy resources nextera energy partners and nextera energy i want to thank all of our employees at nextera energy for providing me the opportunity to work alongside them i have learned and laughed much over the years and will miss the innovative fast paced environment in which we work i have no concrete plans as of now but i am excited about pursuing new adventures and honing old skills at the very least retirement will allow me to pursue one of my great passions fishing thanks again to all of you who have helped guide me and our company successfully over the years our company is in terrific shape and i congratulate and applaud john and rebecca on their new roles well deserved i will now turn the call over to john john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you armando and jim let s now turn to the detailed results beginning with fpl for the fourth quarter of 2018 fpl reported net income of 407 million or 0 85 per share up 0 01 per share compared to fpl s adjusted earnings in the prior year period for the full year 2018 fpl reported net income of 2 2 billion or 4 55 per share an increase of 0 46 per share versus fpl s adjusted earnings in 2017 regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 12 4 for 2018 and was a principal driver of fpl s adjusted net income growth of 12 5 for the full year fpl s capital expenditures were approximately 1 5 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly 5 1 billion fpl s reported roe for regulatory purposes was 11 6 for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9 6 to 11 6 under our current rate agreement during the fourth quarter we restored an additional 240 million of reserve amortization leaving fpl with a year end 2018 balance of 541 million we continue to expect that fpl will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years creating further customer benefits by potentially avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and perhaps 2022 before moving on let me now take a moment to update you on some of our key capital initiatives at fpl during 2018 fpl completed construction on schedule and on budget for the first eight 74 5 megawatt solar energy centers developed under the solar base rate adjustment or sobra mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement in 2018 we also deployed the first two projects under fpl s 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program pairing battery systems with existing solar projects and highlighting fpl s innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of its clean energy solutions for customers the next 300 megawatts of solar projects being built under the sobra mechanism remain on budget and on track to begin providing cost effective energy to fpl customers in early 2019 to support the significant solar expansion that fpl is leading across florida we have secured sites that could potentially support more than 7 gigawatts of future projects beyond solar construction on the approximately 1750 megawatt okeechobee clean energy center remains on budget and on schedule to enter service in the middle of this year additionally the roughly 1200 megawatt dania beach clean energy center received siting board approval during the quarter to support its projected commercial operation date in 2022 we continue to expect that fpl s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate in regulatory capital employed net of accumulated deferred income taxes of approximately 9 from the start of the settlement agreement in january 2017 through at least december 2021 while further enhancing our customer value proposition the economy in florida remains healthy the current unemployment rate of 3 3 remains below the national average and at the lowest levels in a decade florida s consumer confidence level remains near 10 year highs the real estate sector also continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at healthy levels and the case shiller index for south florida home prices up 4 8 from the prior year fpl s fourth quarter retail sales increased 4 from the prior year comparable period we estimate that weather related usage per customer contributed approximately 0 6 to this amount on a weather normalized basis fourth quarter sales increased 3 4 with positive contributions from both weather normalized usage per customer and ongoing customer growth including the addition of vero beach s customers for 2018 we estimate that fpl s retail sales on a weather normalized basis increased by 2 6 continued customer growth and an estimated 1 7 increase in weather normalized usage per customer both contributed favorably while we are encouraged by the growth and underlying usage in 2018 which was a consistent benefit during all four quarters as we have often discussed this measure can be volatile and we are not yet ready to draw any firm conclusions about long term trends we will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and we ll update you on future calls let me now turn to energy resources which reported fourth quarter 2018 gaap earnings of 263 million or 0 55 per share adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were 317 million or 0 66 per share for the full year energy resources reported gaap earnings of 4 66 billion or 9 75 per share and adjusted earnings of 1 46 billion or 3 05 per share in the fourth quarter energy resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share increased by 0 18 from the prior year comparable period positive contributions from new investments customer supply and trading our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines and the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate all supported the strong year over year growth these favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our existing generation assets as a result of particularly poor fleetwide wind resource which was the lowest fourth quarter on record over the last 30 years and higher interest in corporate expenses due to growth in the business energy resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased 0 45 or approximately 17 versus 2017 for the full year contributions from the new investments declined by 0 04 per share due in part to the expected smaller than usual 2017 renewable bill for 2019 and beyond we expect meaningful growth from new investments as we continue to execute on our renewables development backlog increased ptc volume from approximately 1600 megawatts of repowered wind projects that were commissioned in 2017 helped to increase contributions from existing generation assets by 0 10 per share contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines increased by 0 17 per share year over year as expected the reduction of corporate federal income tax rate was accretive to energy resources increasing adjusted eps by 0 45 compared to 2017 all other impacts reduced results by 0 23 per share primarily as a result of higher interest and corporate expenses driven largely by increased development activity to support the favorable renewables development environment additional details are shown on the accompanying slide in 2018 energy resources continued to advance its position as a leading developer and operator of wind solar and battery storage projects commissioning nearly 2700 megawatts of new renewable projects in the us including an additional 900 megawatts of repowered wind since the last call we have added 1791 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog including 680 megawatts of wind 797 megawatts of solar and 215 megawatts of battery storage all of which will be paired with new solar projects included in the solar megawatts we added to backlog this quarter is a 150 megawatt solar build own transfer project with a 10 year o m agreement that will allow the customer to leverage energy resources best in class operating skills while providing meaningful ongoing revenue through the contract term during the quarter energy resources signed an additional 99 megawatts of wind repowering and successfully commissioned approximately 600 megawatts of repowering projects for 2017 and 2018 this brings the total repowering projects placed in service to roughly 2500 megawatts near the top end of the previously outlined range for this period we continue to expect to be in the upper half of the 2 5 billion to 3 billion in total capital deployment for repowering for 2017 through 2020 following the record origination year in 2018 and with nearly two years remaining in the development period we are now within the previously outlined 2017 to 2020 ranges for us wind solar and wind repowering for the post 2020 period our backlog is already nearly 2000 megawatts placing us well ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage the accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands beyond renewables we completed a construction of approximately 175 miles of the mountain valley pipeline during 2018 as planned mvp is continuing with its scaled back construction efforts for the winter while we continue to target our previously announced full in service date for the pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2019 and a revised overall project cost estimate of 44 6 billion we also continue to work through the project s outstanding legal challenges and to closely monitor developments related to the atlantic coast pipeline and the current government shutdown as the outcome of any one of these issues could impact mvp s project schedule and cost estimate we also continue to evaluate mitigation alternatives to address potential adverse outcomes should they arise mvp s expected annual contribution to nextera energy s ongoing adjusted eps is approximately 0 07 to 0 09 we do not expect any material adjusted earnings impacts nor any change in nextera energy s financial expectations as a result of the ongoing challenges we ll provide further updates as those proceedings evolve turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy for the fourth quarter of 2018 gaap net income attributable to the nextera energy was 422 million or 0 88per share nextera energy s 2018 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were 718 million or 1 49 per share respectively for the full year 2018 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 6 64 billion or 13 08 per share adjusted earnings were 3 67 billion or 7 70 or per share reflecting growth of 15 off our 2017 adjusted eps including approximately 0 45 benefit from lower federal income taxes for the corporate and other segment adjusted earnings for the full year increased 0 09 per share compared to 2017 primarily due to lower interest and certain favorable tax items we continue to expect nextera energy s adjusted eps compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6 to 8 through 2021 off our 2018 adjusted eps of 7 70 plus accretion of 0 15 and 0 20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the florida acquisitions for 2019 we continue to expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of 8 to 8 50 from 2018 to 2021 we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we are closely following the recent developments with pacific gas and electric projects directly affected by the potential pg e bankruptcy have an expected annual adjusted eps contribution of roughly 0 13 to 0 15 for nextera energy regardless of the outcome of pg e s anticipated bankruptcy proceedings we expect to achieve nextera energy s adjusted eps expectations that i just outlined and we ll be disappointed if we are not able to deliver growth at or near the top of our 6 to 8 compound annual growth rate range off our 2018 base of 7 70 plus the expected deal accretion from the florida transactions we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12 to 14 per year through at least 2020 off a 2017 base of dividends per share of 3 93 as always our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions let me now turn to nep which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2018 yesterday the nep board declared a quarterly distribution of 46 50 per common unit or 1 86 per unit on an annualized basis up 15 from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2018 for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda and cafd increased to 18 and 36 respectively primarily as a result of portfolio growth in addition to meeting neps growth objectives with the acquisition from energy resources during 2018 we were also pleased to announce the execution of a long term contract that enables an expansion investment in the texas pipelines the opportunity which is subject to regulatory approvals is expected to be in service during the fourth quarter of 2020 demonstrates the organic growth potential of nep s underlying portfolio beyond the attractive low cost convertible portfolio equity financing of blackrock nep took additional steps to further enhance its financial financing flexibility during 2018 in the fourth quarter nep entered into an additional 1 billion interest rate hedge agreement to help mitigate interest rate volatility on future debt issuances nep s hedge agreement has a fixed rate of approximately 3 95 and can be flexibly utilized at any date until december 11th 2028 the swap is incremental to the 5 billion hedge agreement that we announced last year providing significant protection against interest rate risk and npe executes on it s long term growth plan as nep executes on its long term growth plan additionally during 2018 we successfully raised approximately 85 million through the sale of roughly 1 8 million ph common units under nep s atm program going forward we will continue to flexibly seek opportunities to use the atm program depending on market conditions and other considerations now let s look at the detailed results fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 165 million and cash available for distribution was 44 million a decrease of 35 million and 33 million from the prior year comparable quarter respectively the decline was primarily driven by the sale of the canadian portfolio earlier in the year with those assets not replaced until the late december closing on the 1 4 gigawatt acquisition from energy resources for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda and cafd were 881 million and 339 million up 18 and 36 respectively primarily driven by growth of the underlying portfolio existing projects benefited from increased contributions from texas pipelines versus the prior year for adjusted ebitda this benefit was offset by the year over year reduction in the pre tax value of nep s tax credits as a result of the decline in the federal income tax rate this change has no income no impact on cafd cash available for distribution from existing projects also benefited from reduced debt service which was roughly offset by higher corporate level interest expense as a reminder these results include the impact of idr fees which we treat as an operating expense additional details are shown on the accompanying slide for nep absent any impact from a pg e bankruptcy filing our december 31 2018 run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda of 1 billion to 1 15 billion and cafd of 360 million to 400 million are unchanged reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the portfolio with which we ended the year our previously announced december 31 2019 run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda of 1 2 billion to 1 375 billion and cafd of 410 million to 480 million are also unchanged our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense from an updated base of our fourth quarter 2018 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of a 1 86 we continue to see 12 to 15 per year growth in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023 we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2019 distribution that is payable in february 2020 to be in a range of 2 08 to 2 14 per common unit nep expects to be able to manage through the impacts of the anticipated pg e bankruptcy and to achieve the growth expectations that i just outlined as we have previously disclosed the 420 megawatts of projects that are contracted with pg e represent 15 to 18 of nep s expected year end 2018 run rate cash available for distribution as a result of the pg e board of directors authorizing the commencement of a bankruptcy filing we believe an event of default has likely occurred under the genesis financing the administrative agent for the desert sunlight 300 financing has notified and said an event of default has occurred under those agreements which we dispute and they are currently withholding the january distribution for any financing where an event of default is determined to have occurred cash distributions can be restricted and other remedies could be exercised including acceleration of the debt additionally due to provisions in the financings an event of default under the desert sunlight 300 financing can prevent distributions from desert sunlight 250 which is contracted with sce we expect the combination of desert sunlight 250 and the pg e projects to contribute roughly 18 of nep s year end 2019 run rate cafd as we execute on nep s growth strategy we expect this to further decline over time and that the pg e projects and desert sunlight 250 will not represent a significant percentage of nep s 2023 cash available for distribution for projects where cash distributions are restricted we expect that over time these funds will go toward paying down the principal on existing financings which would potentially result in more distributable cash flows to nep in the future in each of these projects we are reviewing our alternatives and we ll pursue all options to protect our interests including vigorously defending our contracts and working with key stakeholders of each financing even in a worst case scenario where we receive no further contributions from projects that are contracted with pg e or desert sunlight 250 we continue to expect that nep will achieve its annual 12 to 15 growth and distributions per unit through 2023 without the need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest other than modest at the market issuances we are pleased with nep s strong performance in 2018 and believe it continues to provide a best in class investor value proposition with the flexibility to grow in three ways acquiring assets from energy resources organically or acquiring assets from other third parties nep has clear visibility to support its growth going forward following a new record renewables origination year by energy resources and the continued strength of the best renewables development environment in our history nep s growth visibility further improved in 2018 additionally nep s cost to capital and access to capital advantages further improved over the past year providing flexibility to finance its growth over the long term when nep s growth potential and financing flexibility are combined with its favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights we believe nep is well positioned to meet its financial expectations and we look forward to delivering on nep s strategic and growth initiatives in 2019 and beyond that concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions questions and answers operator speaker o operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and we ll go first to stephen byrd of morgan stanley stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst hi good morning armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc hi good morning stephen stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst armando congratulations on your retirement and john and rebecca congratulations on your new role all very well deserved armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc thank you stephen stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst i wanted to just talk as you can imagine about california for a minute if all of the project debt essentially withheld cash to the arguably to the extent that they were would be permitted i wanted to make sure i was clear how much cafd would be restricted you mentioned 18 related to several projects but i wanted to check if every single piece of debt relating to pg e sort of exercised their cash cash trap right what amount of cafd would be impacted john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so again it would comprise roughly 18 of our run rate cafd for 2019 we have included a page in our investor materials that details page 41 page 41 that details the cafd from each of these projects totals about 90 million stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst understood john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer so let s go back though to what i just said which is that first of all even if all of that cash is trapped we expect to be able to meet our financial expectations 12 to 15 growth in distributions per unit through 2023 we expect we will not have a need to issue common equity until 2020 at the earliest so our financial expectations are not impacted by any means while the second the impact of pg e and sce cash flows is going to diminish over time so by the time we get to the end of the period of our financial expectations the cash flows from these projects is not going to be significant a significant contributor to the overall cafd and then i think you have to take a look too stephen at the at what is happening in california i mean obviously we are not going to sit on our heels we re going to pursue all avenues with our note holders to try to to try to free up that cash and we ll work vigorously to do that as i said in the prepared remarks stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst that all makes sense and john in terms of any exposure to other california utilities i m thinking of the edison international and sempra just wanted to check both at nep and nextera would you mind just speaking briefly to your other california exposure armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah so on our on our other california exposure with sce i mean right now we don t have any because there s none of those financings are in default other than the sce contract that i mentioned which is about 250 megawatts on desert sunlight because that s part of a portfolio financing but again the impacts of that are included in the numbers that i gave you earlier so the 250 impact is included in the 0 13 to 0 15 at nextera energy it is also included in the roughly 18 of total cafd for 2019 stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst okay but do you have any cafd exposure not in default but does where are the offtaker is a subsidiary of either edison international or sempra armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc no zero stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst okay armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc at nep at nep stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst okay great just wanted to check armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc zero stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst at nep okay and at nextera is that significant or is it relatively small armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc it s relatively small i mean the contributions that we would have from sce contracts are roughly 0 08 and that includes the desert sunlight 250 so without without it it s about 0 06 so small stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst understood sorry for all the questions on california maybe just one last one you filed at burke to sort of secure your legal rights under the contracts would you mind just to kind of briefly talk in through your legal arguments around ensuring that you protect your rights under your contracts armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah i mean the bottom line is we think a majority those contracts have inaudible provisions and that these contracts are in the public interest and that the federal power act pre empts what the bankruptcy court can do and if and they forecast the final say on assumption or rejection stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst that s very good that s all i have thank you very much operator we will now go to our next question and that will come from steve fleishman of wolfe research steve fleishman wolfe research analyst yeah good morning so just first on the nep plan i assume your embedded in there you re assuming that you can continue to get financing other than equity i assume including some of the like private financings converts and such that you ve gotten in the past how do you feel about the ability to get those with this california uncertainty john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer first of all on the finances like the blackrock financing still feel good about our ability to be able to execute against those types of financings and again we also have a lot of debt capacity at npe that we can always fall back on as well steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay and then just separate question off topic could you update your interest thoughts and interest in santee cooper james l robo chairman and chief executive officer yeah thanks steve this is jim we we did put a proposal in to acquire santee cooper i think i ve been very clear that we have been interested in pursuing santee cooper over the last 18 months or so and we did put a proposal in to to acquire it and we look forward to the next steps of the process that the committee is going to be going through steve fleishman wolfe research analyst do you have any idea when you ll get an answer james l robo chairman and chief executive officer i think this is a process that ultimately has to if the legislature decides to sell santee cooper it s going to have to actually pass a law to do so essentially and the legislative session ends at the end of may or june in that time period so it s going to play out over the next several months is the bottom line steve steve fleishman wolfe research analyst armando best to you thank you armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc thanks steve operator and now we will go to julien dumoulin smith of bank of america merrill lynch julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning congrats armando can you hear me armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah thanks julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst good well just one quick clarification on the ferc strategy under nep and then i ll move away from it but just if there is indeed some kind of stay how does that impact the technical default and the possibility of distribution so i want to clarify that or cash and pg e for that matter armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah from a ferc standpoint if there were a ferc well first of all if ferc were to grant the relief that we re seeking by the end of the week i mean i think it just would grant ferc the final say in what happens to the contract so i don t think it really has any impact on the status of the existing finances julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it okay fair enough excellent and then i just want to turn back to fpl real quickly specifically on the last call you talked about having shall we say adequate reserve amortization you also talk about usage trends et cetera and the ability to potentially avoid base rate increases in 21 and 22 where does that stand now how if at all is that impacted by some of the latest events just curious on how you re positioning fpl into the longer term here armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah i don t think it s impacted by any of the current events we feel very good very good about our position in front of the opc if that julian was what you were referring to as other events we ve ended the year julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst or maybe being more specific were you expecting to pen something more formal about further rates there armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc well here s where we are right now we have 540 million of surplus and in the year we have we believe and expect to have enough surplus to potentially stay out of a rate case for 21 and 22 we will make those strategic rate case decisions later but we have a lot of flexibility and that flexibility is very good for florida customers because the longer we are able to stay out the longer period of time that that bills stay where they are and they don t see a bill impact from another rate case james l robo chairman and chief executive officer hey julien this is jim i think you can expect us to give you all some more thoughts on that front in the june investor conference julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent and then maybe jim this is a quick question to your direction but as you think kind of conceptually especially given the commitments from the last analyst day around midstream potentially some of the latest developments you ve already alluded to around renewables especially some of the rpf expansions that might be coming in the next six months prior to the june analyst day could you give us a little bit of your latest thought process around your future investment prospects just a little bit more holistically james l robo chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure i mean when you look at our capital investment plans i think they are over 12 billion this year when you look at what we re doing at fpl gulf and energy resources combined something in that range we are as of as of the year before last we don t have the details yet on last year we were the fourth largest investor of capital in the united states in any industry only at t verizon and amazon invested more in this country than we did in terms of capital investment and we are going to continue to do what we have done for more than a decade which is invest smart capital at fpl to improve the value proposition for customers and we re going to we re very excited about and we ll have more to say about what we re doing at gulf in our june meeting but we ve hit the ground running very excited about what we re doing in terms of what investment prospects there are on the gulf front and we re moving aggressively forward on that pretty much on day one and at energy resources it is the best renewable environment that we ve ever seen and we are going to continue to invest in renewables going forward and as we see pipeline opportunities contract and pipeline opportunities we ll continue to invest in those as well so i don t think you should expect a big change in our thinking in june i think you ll just see us frankly roll forward our vision for the amount of investment and the amount of customer improvement that we re going to bring to our customers as well as the amount of what we re gonna do in terms of earnings going forward julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst i ll leave it there thank you very much john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thanks julien operator we will now go to greg gordon of evercore isi greg gordon evercore isi analyst congratulations to all three of you goes without saying you re all terrific at your jobs and armando someone asked me to ask you if you could get circle back with people and tell us where you like to fish that would be good now that you re going to have multiple speakers armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc that s coming greg gordon evercore isi analyst a couple of questions can you just go back over what you said about the levelized cost of energy for battery with storage and what i m particularly interested other than just a restatement of that is what delivery year you see that crossover happening on sort of a large enough scale to tip this sort of disruptive transition that you re you re talking about armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yes so what we covered in jim s remarks we ll start with the wind so wind we are expecting to be right around 20 25 a megawatt hour i d kind of put that wraps and ptc helping there this is a no incentive look so call it when those incentives expire more toward the middle of the decade that 2024 time frame so 20 25 megawatt for wind and we think batteries are going to be about a 0 05 to 0 075 adder and so that s how we were able to i m sorry per megawatt that s how we re able to get to the ranges that jim provided for wind so just take the 20 plus the 20 25 add on 0 05 to 0 075 ph for battery storage for solar don t forget we have the solar itc at 30 through the end of 2023 and so when those itcs go away and they don t ever go away right they go from 30 to 10 we are expecting that we solar given how quickly panel costs are coming down balance of plant costs are coming down solar is a product we re going to be selling in the 25 megawatt hour to 30 megawatt hour range and then the same adders for batteries is how you get to the math that were in were in jim s remarks and those are the expectations we have and solar pricing isn t really all that far off from what we re doing today so that s not much of a leap of faith greg gordon evercore isi analyst yeah that makes sense i appreciate it and last question you didn t mention it explicitly anywhere in your comments but the balance sheet capacity of 5 billion to 7 billion i mean your credit metrics and the position on the balance sheet seems unchanged from last quarter so i would assume that you still feel like that balance sheet capacity is in place john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah gordon greg one of the things that we ve said there is that we had 5 billion to 7 billion right we bought trans bay there was a 1 billion so we took that down call it 4 billion to 6 billion and we re earmarking probably another 2 billion of capex opportunities for fpl we ll update what where exactly that will be used at our june conference but certainly some of that money is going to go toward the 30 by 30 initiative that we already announced earlier last week greg gordon evercore isi analyst got you great update thank you guys operator we now will go to michael lapides of goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys obviously armando congrats on your announcement and to the rest of the team to john and rebecca as well great to see people move around and getting new opportunities one question about florida ballot initiative that is being pushed right now can you just talk about what is actually in that ballot initiative what it would mean if it were to garner the votes and what s the process from here john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah i m going to turn that question over to eric eric silagy president and chief executive officer florida power light company hi michael how are you doing today michael lapides goldman sachs analyst great eric thanks for taking this eric silagy president and chief executive officer florida power light company yeah no problem the ballot initiative it s been famous about helping florida customers it s not about their law when you look at it it s really about furthering the business interests of a few folks including a retail electric provider that s located and based out gainesville that markets power currently outside of florida this is group they tried on successfully to get this proposal in front of voters through the constitution revision commission and also through the inaudible where they tried two legislation in tallahassee their efforts have been unsuccessful in the past because frankly florida s regulated electricity market works really well it s our when you look at the state the power prices are among the lowest in the nation with electricity that s among the cleanest and most reliable in the country as an example florida power light offers our customers bills that more than 30 lower than the national average lower than bills in 45 states and as john said earlier we re just recognized third time in four years as the most reliable electric provider in the country which as you can appreciate in a state like this is important when our customers need us most particularly during times of storms and hurricanes so plain and simply it s a proposal that just it actually will lead to increases in electric rates across the state reduce reliability particularly during periods of storms hurricanes things of that nature and i think it s going to compromise the clean energy goals that have been announced including the one we just did on fpl s 30 by 30 initiative as the unregulated power producers would they d have no restrictions on the type of generation that they would build also i think it s important to understand on these type of things that consumer projections are removed you no longer have florida public service commission role in determining what rates are they would no longer be viewed as being just and reasonable if that s the standard it would go out the window and that s going to impact reliability as well the ability of customers this language would actually prohibit customers from being able to buy power from the existing utilities so florida power light customers would not be able to continue to be customers of florida power light there s some other areas too that i think is receiving a lot of focus on including the fact that franchise fees which we collect and pay to municipalities across the state would be eliminated and that is significant amount of revenue that would no longer be available to pay for things like first responders firefighters police hospital employees these municipalities that everybody counts on even you look at now attorney generals and a number of other states have called for the end of deregulation due to all of the consumer complaints and the deceptive trade practices so there s a lot of reasons why these proposals have failed across the country since frankly the early 2000s you look at including even recently in nevada where it failed there s when you look at other states that looked at this a lot of them backed away particularly after the california crisis there and when enron moved in to california to take advantage of their so called market based model which was ultimately the catalyst for that crisis and helped contribute to the state having some of the highest power prices in the country so i don t think it s by accident that there hasn t been a state of fast deregulation since the california power crisis which occurred now nearly 20 years ago so there s a number of hurdles to answer your question they have to be cleared for this proposal to go forward to be placed on the ballot we re going to be very actively engaged we re going to be educating floridians on the true motives of the special interest groups and we re going to also spend a lot of time educating folks on the significant negative impacts that this failed idea would have on the state and on their pocketbooks michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you eric i appreciate that i have one other for either jim john or armando when you re and this is more longer term when you re watching what s happening in california with pg e with edison international or so inaudible and put california in the context of being the nation s largest renewable market and with the most aggressive renewable target how do you think this impacts the broader u s development over renewables if one of the largest markets is going through some turmoil and how do you think about that kind of longer term armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc so it s great question michael i think one of the first thing i d say is california has some very aggressive renewable targets and some very aggressive climate change goals the turmoil around the credit of the most important counterparties in the state is to say the least is not conducive to continued capital investment to continue to further those goals and so i think it s a from an energy policy standpoint in the state of california it s going to be very important for the state to recognize that and to recognize that there s been significant capital investment by companies from around the world to make that happen and to the extent to that that investment is somehow diminished by these credit issues i think that s going to have a real impact on their market going forward and i think the state understands that and it s one of the elements of the things that they re grappling with now as they deal with the fallout from the tragic fires as well as some of the other issues that they ve been facing so the good news from a market standpoint is california was obviously the biggest market in the country 10 years ago in the renewable business it isn t anymore it s an important market but it s no longer the most important market in the country and with the cost declines in renewables nearly every state in the country is in the we have an opportunity to do business i mean we have my last count we have development going on in 48 states right now we don t have operating projects in 48 states but we have development going on in 48 states so while i think it s very important for the state to address these issues from a climate change standpoint going forward i think the renewable market is going to be robust going forward because it is just gotten so big and the cost declines have expanded the market to such a dramatic fashion operator and with that we ll go now to jonathan arnold of deutsche bank jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my question armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc hey good morning jonathan jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst quick question on this is as i think about you talked about managing through the situation at nep in context of the growth rate so as we think about things you might do that would fall under that header you mentioned pushing to have the cash released and i guess you could drop down other assets more quickly you could let the dividend drift down in the range and still be within 12 to 15 ph is there anything else that i m missing and which of those kind of alternatives would you either be planning to use or not use armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah i think i d go first of all back to the prior one of the prior questions about are there other attractive financing vehicles available one yes we think there are but two even if we had the finance additional drops to meet our financial expectations with existing debt capacity that we have we can do that we re fine and so really the way i would answer that question is that obviously we ll vigorously try to negotiate something with the holders that would allow us to and the doe don t forget the doe is in all of is in these projects that would allow us to free up the cash we can t do that we have debt capacity plenty of debt capacity at nep energy resources is coming off the best development year in its history we have very clear visibility to growth prospects going forward and there are many levers in the vehicle so we are comfortable in our ability to manage through even a worst case scenario which would be where the cash is trapped until a final call is made on the contract jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay but john just you ve i think to be clear you ve said in some of them the cash is trapped just by virtue of pg e saying that it may file is that correct and yeah just curious john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah multiple speakers get into the technicalities but one of the financings has a provision that basically just says if there s corporate action taken in furtherance of a bankruptcy which our lawyers view the filing of the 8 k to be that that would constitute potentially constitute an event of default jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst so that was just on one of them john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer that s on the genesis financing jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay and then what would john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer it s on some of it s on some of the other nee financings but the nee financings are small it s a series of four or five projects that don t have any meaningful contribution to earnings at nee jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst so there would be a sort of a judgment as to what would definitively constitute that not occurring presumably john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah i mean it doesn t happen then i think it s back to business as usual armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc jonathan let me just add just let me add something i mean obviously i think it s appropriate for the focus on the pg e assets and the cash flows but we still have at both at nextera energy resources and the nextera energy partners we still have a lot of projects that are not pg e southern california edison projects that have significant cash flows and there are still many parties that are interested in attractive financings attractive for us and presumably for them that we re talking to and it s not necessarily about what s the risk of pg e in southern california edison it s about hey what other assets are available for us to be able to enter into those types of financing so i think while it s appropriate to have some focus on what s going on with pg e we got to remember that nextera energy resources has had its we had 6600 megawatts of origination this year which is a record year and that s twice the amount we had last year which was a record year and i got to tell you we feel at least internally very comfortable as john said that even if these pg e cash flows are tied up in these debt financings that we can meet our current expectations and one of the reasons that we feel that way is because we re talking to the market and two origination is going very well in energy resources jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst great that s helpful perspective thank you armando and then could i just one other thing inaudible with the gulf and florida acquisitions having closed sooner i think than maybe you thought is there but you re not talking of any accretion in 19 that would just sort of help us understand the bump in 20 what s driving that and why nothing this year armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc so jonathan obviously we got it done a little earlier than we thought but we also always assume that we d have some cost to achieve this year to get there so we re being conservative as we always are and we feel very good about our plans at gulf and you can bet i m pushing the team very hard to get things done even faster than we ve laid out and so i m really optimistic about the future for gulf in this company and our ability to bring real value to their customers and real value to shareholders so very excited about it we ll have more to talk about it in june but remember we don t have any cost to achieve in any of these numbers in 19 jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay thank you very much operator and with that ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today s conference we want to thank you again for attending today s presentation duration 76 minutes call participants matthew roskot director of investor relations james l robo chairman and chief executive officer armando pimentel

with another one advertisement the u s china trade war worries about britain s imminent departure from the european union a potential recession in italy and unrest in south america all pose risks for the global economy while the u s federal reserve embarked on its current tightening cycle back in december 2015 the european central bank bank of england and bank of japan still have interest rates at or near rock bottom policymakers want to start raising borrowing costs so they have more room to manoeuvre if there is another downturn but they risk fanning the slowdown hundreds of economists polled by reuters this month think is already underway central banks are also facing increasing pressure from governments to keep policy loose bringing their independence into question advertisement u s president donald trump has taken a swipe at the fed italy has put pressure on the ecb to extend its asset purchases and indian prime minister narendra modi has made it clear to the reserve bank of india that he wants stimulative monetary policy ahead of national elections in may advertisement with the global economy likely to slow over the coming quarters it seems more likely that central banks will continue to come under fire from populist leaders said neil shearing group chief economist at ing but most central banks target inflation not growth tighter policy usually strengthens currencies while reducing consumer and business spending which should keep inflation lower but it also risks curtailing what is pretty scant growth in many countries advertisement the bank of japan has been targeting inflation of 2 percent for years without success it is not expected to start normalizing its extremely loose monetary policy until 2020 or later ecb president mario draghi may also have to wait a long time before policy is tightened he acknowledged on thursday that growth in the euro zone was likely to be weaker than previously expected although the bank stuck to its guidance that it intends to raise interest rates later this year for the first time in a decade advertisement it is now expected to wait until the fourth quarter to raise its deposit rate however later than thought a month ago only 36 of 65 economists polled by reuters this month were confident the ecb would be able to raise rates before the next downturn the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties draghi told a news conference citing trade and geopolitical threats emerging market volatility and brexit advertisement britain is due to leave the european union in a little over two months but there is still huge uncertainty about what relationship the two sides will have come brexit day on march 29 bank rate in the uk has been

predicted the u s central bank would either hike rates only once or keep the fed funds rate unchanged at 2 25 2 50 percent in 2019 u s monetary policy tightening is pretty much over and the ecb seems set to miss the boat altogether in this cycle said andrew kenningham chief euro zone economist at capital economics advertisement a further escalation in the trade war president trump is waging on

measure with that i will turn the call over to john jim robo chairman and chief executive officer thanks matt and good morning everyone as john will detail later in the call 2018 was a terrific year for both nextera energy and nextera energy partners by successfully executing on our plans at both fpl and energy resources nextera energy was able to achieve our target 2018 adjusted eps of 7 70 an increase of approximately 15 over our 2017 results dating back to 2005 we ve now delivered compound annual growth and adjusted eps of over 8 5 which is the highest among all top 10 power companies who have achieved an average compound annual growth of roughly 3 over the same period we delivered a total shareholder return of over 14 in 2018 outperforming the s p 500 by nearly 19 and the s p 500 utilities index by more than 10 since 2005 we have outperformed 86 of the s p 500 and 100 of the other companies in the s p 500 utilities index while continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a 1 3 5 7 and 10 year basis we re once again honored to be named for the 12th time in 13 years no 1 in the electric and gas utilities industry on fortune s list of what world s most admired companies and to be among the top 25 of fortune s 2018 change the world lists during 2018 fpl successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan including the continuation of one of the largest solar expansion server in the u s and achieved its oem efficiency target to further improve its best in class customer value proposition as a result of continued smart investments to benefit our customers fpl s typical residential bill is more than 30 below the national average the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the state of florida and nearly 10 below the level it was in 2006 in addition to low bills fpl delivered its best ever service reliability performance in 2018 and was recognized for the third time in four years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation throughout the year we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities across the country and recovery from natural disasters and we remain grateful for the support that others have given us over the years after a nearly 10 year processes last month fpl closed on the purchase of city of vero beach s municipal electric system we look forward to extending fpl s value proposition to vero beach s approximately 35 000 customers while also generating significant long term savings for fpl s existing customers the benefit to both new and existing customers is reflective of fpl s collaborative efforts with city local and regional leaders as well as other state authorities to find the best outcome for all stakeholders earlier this morning month we were pleased to close on the purchase of gulf power and excited to welcome our new colleagues to the nextera energy family we ve now successfully completed all three transactions with southern company that we announced in the middle of last year the acquisitions are an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand nextera energy s regulated business mix through the addition of attractive electric and natural gas franchises by executing on the same long term strategy that we ve deployed at fpl we expect the acquisitions to benefit customers shareholders and the florida economy the energy resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2018 the renewables origination success was particularly strong as the team added approximately 6 500 megawatts including storage and repowering to our backlog over the past year this represents the most successful origination year in our history and is nearly twice as many megawatts as we originated in 2017 our prior record year our ongoing renewable origination success results from operating from what we believe to be the best renewables development environment in our history in our ability to leverage energy resources competitive advantages these competitive advantages include our best in class development skills strong customer relationships purchasing power best in class construction expertise resources capabilities strong access to and cost of capital advantages and the ability to combine wind solar and battery storage into integrated newly form low cost products during the year we were pleased to receive the irs target construction guidance on the solar itc which we believe positions us well for substantial solar and storage growth well into the next decade in 2018 more than 40 of the solar projects that were added to our backlog included a battery storage complement highlighting the beginning of the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution with continued technology improvements and cost declines we expect that without incentives wind is going to be a 0 02 to 0 025 per kilowatt per hour product and solar is going to be 0 025 to 0 03 per kilowatt hour product early in the next decade combining these extremely low cost with one half to three quarter cent adder for a four hour storage system will create a nearly renewable generation resource that is cheaper than the operating cost of coal nuclear and less fuel efficient oil and gas fired generation units we continue to believe that this will be massively disruptive to the nations generation fleet and create significant opportunities for renewable growth well into the next decade consistent with our focus on growing our rate regulated and long term contracted business operations during the fourth quarter nextera energy transmission announced an agreement to acquire trans bay cable a 53 mile high voltage direct current underwater transmission cable system with utility rate set by ferc which provides approximately 40 of san francisco s daily electric power needs subject to regulatory approvals approximately 1 billion acquisition including the assumption of debt is expected to close later this year and to be immediately accretive to earnings the proposed acquisition combined with the mid continent independent system operator selection of nextera energy transmission to develop the approximately 20 mile single circuit 500 kv hartburg sabine junction transmission line is east texas it furthers our goal of creating america s leading competitive transmission company in addition to successfully growing our regulated operations both organically and through acquisitions through 2018 we further strengthened energy resources existing portfolio during the year in december the connecticut department of energy and environmental protection selected approximately 20 of the seabrook nuclear plants generation and 80 megawatts of new solar projects which are not yet included in our backlog for long term contracts by operating one of the top performing nuclear plants in the nation energy resources expects to provide significant amounts of carbon free energy at prices generally in line with current curves while generating attractive shareholder returns as a result seabrook s contract pricing is expected to be roughly 50 lower than the cost of offshore wind generating significant savings for connecticut customers over the 8 year contract term the seabrook award compliments energy resources exited the merchant business which we began back in 2011 and essentially completed in 2016 with the sale of our forney lamar and marcus hook natural gas generation assets excluding seabrook the remaining merchant generation assets contribute less than 1 of nextera energy s consolidated adjusted ebitda going forward we expect this contribution to decline as the focus remains on regulated and long term contracted opportunities in renewables natural gas pipelines and regulated transmission as always we will continue to opportunistically evaluate recycling capital through sales of nonstrategic assets in our portfolio including the remaining fossil generation assets fund additional growth of long term contracted businesses as a result of increasing the expected adjusted earnings contribution from rate regulated businesses to roughly 70 and the steps that we have taken to further de risk the energy resources portfolio s p announced earlier this month that they have revised their assessment of nextera energy s business risk profile upward from strong to excellent as a result of this improvement s p reduced nextera energy s ffo to debt downgrade threshold from 23 to 21 this follows moody s announcement last year that with the expansion of the company s regulated operations to roughly 70 following the gulf power transaction nextera energy s cfo pre working capital to downgrade threshold would be reduced from 20 to 18 at these revised rating agency thresholds and following some utilization of balance sheet capacity for the trans bay transmission acquisition we now expect to maintain 4 billion to 46 billion of excess balance sheet capacity through 2021 while we have multiple alternatives for utilization we expect to use approximately 2 billion of this capacity in the near term to support additional regulated capital investments at fpl consistent with a significant incremental smart investment opportunities that exist at fpl last week we announced fpl s groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan to install more than 30 million solar panels by 2030 resulting in an incremental 10 000 megawatts of solar projects versus what is in operation in fpl today we will give further details on these and other potential investments which were mostly expected to help maintain our long term adjusted eps compound annual growth rate beyond 2021 at our investor conference which we plan to hold on june 20 in new york city following the strong results from 2018 i continue to believe that we have one of the best organic opportunity sets in execution track records in the industry i remain as enthusiastic as ever about our long term prospects and based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses i will be disappointed if we were not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6 to 8 compound annual growth range through 22021 plus the expected deal accretion from the florida transactions while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings let me now turn to nep which also had a terrific year of execution in 2018 as john will describe later in the call nep successfully delivered on its growth objectives for adjusted ebitda cafd and lp distributions during the year we recycled the proceeds from the sale of nep s canadian portfolio into a higher yielding u s portfolio that benefits from a more favorable tax position as a result of this accretive transaction nep extended its expectations for 12 to 15 per year dpu growth by one additional year to 2023 the 1 4 gigawatt renewable portfolio that was acquired from energy resources further enhanced the diversity of nep s existing portfolio and was financed through a combination of the canadian asset sale proceeds and a 750 million convertible equity portfolio financing with blackrock the financing demonstrates nep s ability to access additional low cost sources of capital to finance its growth and with the right to convert a minimum of 70 of the portfolio financing into nep units issued at no discount the transaction further reduces nep s equity needs going forward nep grew the lp distribution by 50 year over year and delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 4 in 2018 which is on the heels of a total unitholder return of over 75 the year prior nep outperformed both the s p 500 and the other yield curves by 7 on average and its total unitholder return was more than 15 higher than the illyrian nep index i continue to believe that a combination of nep s growth visibility along with its flexibility to finance that growth offers unitholders an attractive offer unitholders an attractive investor value proposition for these reasons nep is well positioned to continue executing on its growth objectives and delivering strong performance going forward before turning the call over to john i d like to announce some important organizational changes armando pimentel president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources and president and a member of board of directors of nextera energy partners will retire from each of its positions on march 1 of this year as part of planned leadership success process that

personal remarks armando pimentel president and chief executive officer thank you jim first i want to thank jim for providing me the opportunity to lead energy resources for the last 7 5 years and i want to thank those of you on the phone today who i ve had the privilege of meeting and interacting with since i began at nextera energy 2008 i thank you for the interactive dialogue and the opportunity to continue to tell our story and today there is no doubt that energy resources not only the largest developer operator and owner of renewable energy in the world but also its most profitable and innovative and as i tell our employees and customers i believe we re just getting started i strongly believe that the renewable energy opportunity is actually just beginning the combination of energy storage with wind and solar is a revolution which will expand opportunities for renewables and is very exciting i m profoundly comfortable in the continued success of energy resources nextera energy partners and nextera energy i want to thank all of our employees at nextera energy for providing me the opportunity to work alongside them i have learned and much over the years and will miss the innovative fast pace environment in which we work i have no concrete plans as of now but i m excited by pursuing new adventures and honing old skills at the very least retirement will allow me to pursue one of my great passions fishing thanks again to all of the few that have helped guide me and our company successfully over the years our company is in terrific shape and i congratulate and applaud john and rebecca on their new roles well deserved i will now turn the call over to john john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you armando and jim let s now turn to the detailed results beginning with fpl for the fourth quarter of 2018 fpl reported net income of 407 million or 0 85 per share up 0 01 per share compared to fpl s adjusted earnings in the prior year period for the full year 2018 fpl reported net income of 2 2 billion or 4 55 per share an increase of 0 46 per share versus fpl s adjusted earnings in 2017 regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 12 4 for 2018 and was a principal driver of fpl s adjusted net income growth of 12 5 for the full year fpl s capital expenditures were approximately 1 5 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly 5 1 billion fpl s reported roe for regulatory purposes was 11 6 for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9 6 to 11 6 under our current rate agreement during the fourth quarter we restored an additional 240 million of reserve amortization leaving fpl with a year end 2018 balance of 541 million we continue to expect that fpl will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years creating further customer benefits by potentially avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and perhaps 2022 before moving on let me now take a moment to update you on some of our key capital initiatives at fpl during 2018 fpl completed construction on schedule and on budget for the first eight 74 5 megawatt solar energy centers developed under the solar base rate adjustment or sbra mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement in 2018 we also deployed the first two projects under fpl s 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program pairing battery systems with existing solar project and highlighting fpl s innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of its clean energy solutions for customers the next 300 megawatts of solar projects being built under the silver mechanism remain on budget and on track to begin providing cost effective energy to fpl customers in early 2019 to support the significance solar expansion that fpl is leading across florida we have secured sites that could potentially support more than 7 gigawatts of future projects beyond solar construction on the approximately 1 750 megawatt okeechobee clean energy center remains on budget and on schedule to inner service in the middle of this year additionally the roughly 1 200 megawatt dania beach clean energy center received siting board approval during the quarter to support its projected commercial operation date in 2022 we continue to expect that fpl s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed net of accumulative deferred income taxes of approximately 9 from the start of a settlement agreement in january 2017 through at least december 2021 while further enhancing our customer value proposition the economy in florida remains healthy the current unemployment rate of 3 3 remains below the national average and at the lowest levels in a decade florida s consumer confidence level remains near 10 year highs the real estate sector also continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at healthy levels and the case shiller index for south florida home prices up 4 8 from the prior year fpl s fourth quarter retail sales increased 4 from the prior year comparable period we estimate that weather related usage per customer contributed approximately 0 6 to this amount on a weather normalized basis fourth quarter sales increased 3 4 with positive contributions from both weather normalized usage per customer and ongoing customer growth including the addition of vero beach s customers for 2018 we estimate that fpl s retail sales on a weather normalized basis increased by 2 6 continued customer growth and an estimated 1 7 increase in weather normalized usage per customer both contributed favorably while we are encouraged by the growth in underlying usage in 2018 which was a consistent benefit during all four quarters as we have often discussed this measure can be volatile and we are not yet ready to draw any firm conclusions about long term trends we ll continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and will update you on future calls let me now turn to energy resources which reported fourth quarter 2018 gaap earnings of 263 million or 0 55 per share adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were 317 million or 0 66 per share for the full year energy resources reported gaap earnings of 4 66 billion or 0 0975 per share and adjusted earnings of 1 46 billion or 3 05 per share in the fourth quarter energy resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share increased by 0 18 from the prior year comparable period positive contributions from new investments customer supply and trading our gas infrastructure business including pipelines and the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate all supported the strong year over year growth these favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our existing generation assets as a result of particularly poor fleet wide wind resource which was the lowest fourth quarter on record over the last 30 years and higher interest in corporate expenses due to growth in the business energy resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased 0 45 or approximately 17 versus 2017 for the full year contributions from the new investments declined by 0 04 per share due in part to the expected smaller than usual 2017 renewable build in 2019 and beyond we expect meaningful growth from new investments as we continue to execute on our renewables development backlog increased ptc volume from the approximately 1 600 megawatts of repowered wind projects that were commissioned in 2017 helped increased contribution from existing generation assets by 0 10 per share contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines increased by 0 17 per share year over year as expected the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate was accretive to energy resources increasing adjusted eps by 0 45 compared to 2017 all other impacts reduced results by 0 23 per share primarily as a result of higher interest and corporate expenses driven largely by increased development activity to support the favorable renewables development environment additional details are shown on the accompanying slide in 2018 energy resources continue to advance its position as a leading developer and operator of wind solar and battery storage projects commissioning nearly 2 700 megawatts of renewable projects in the u s including an additional 900 megawatts of repowered wind since the last call we have added 1 791 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog including 680 megawatts of wind 797 megawatts of solar and 215 megawatts of battery storage all of which will be paired with new solar projects included in the solar megawatts we added to backlog this quarter is 150 megawatt solar build owned transfer project with a 10 year loan agreement that will allow the customer to leverage energy resources best in class operating skills while providing meaningful ongoing revenue through the contract term during the quarter energy resources signed an additional 99 megawatts of repowering and successfully commissioned approximately 600 megawatts of repowering projects for 2017 and 2018 this brings the total repowering projects placed in service to roughly 2 500 megawatts near the top end of the previously outlined range for this period we continue to expect to be in the upper half of the 2 5 billion to 3 billion in total capital deployment for repowering for 2017 through 2020 following the record origination year in 2018 it was nearly two years remaining in the development year we are now within the previously outlined 2017 to 2020 ranges for u s wind solar and wind repowering for the post 2020 period our backlog is already nearly 2 000 megawatts placing us well ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage the accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands beyond renewables we completed the construction of approximately 175 miles of the mountain valley pipeline during 2018 as planned nvp is continuing with its scale back construction efforts for the winter while we continue to target our previously announced full in service state for the pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2019 and revised overall project cost estimate of 4 6 billion we also continue to work through the projects outstanding legal challenges and to closely monitor developments related to the atlanta coast pipeline and the current government shutdown as the outcome of any one of these issues could impact mvp s project schedule and cost estimate we also continue to evaluate mitigation alternators to address potential adverse outcomes should they arise mvp s expected annual contribution to nextera energy to ongoing adjusted eps is approximately 0 7 to 0 09 we do not expect any material adjusted earnings impacts nor any change in nextera energy s financial expectations as a result of the ongoing challenges we will provide further updates as those proceedings evolve turning now with the consolidated results for nextera energy for the fourth quarter 2018 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 422 million or 0 88 per share nextera energy s 2018 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were 718 million or 1 49 per share respectively for the full year 2018 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 6 64 billion or 13 88 per share adjusted earnings were 3 67 billion or 7 70 per share reflecting growth of 15 up our 2017 adjusted eps including an approximately 0 45 benefit from lower federal income taxes for the corporate and other segment adjusted earnings for the full year increased 0 09 per share compared to 2017 primarily due to lower interest and certain favorable tax items we continue to expect nextera energy s adjusted eps compound annual growth rate to be in the range of 6 to 8 through 2021 up our 2018 adjusted eps of 7 70 plus accretion of 0 15 and 0 20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the florida acquisitions for 2019 we continue to expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of 8 to 8 50 from 2018 to 2021 we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we re closely following the recent developments with specific gas and electric projects directly affected by the potential bankruptcy have an expected annual adjusted eps contribution of roughly 0 13 to 0 15 for nextera energy regardless of the outcome of pg e s anticipated bankruptcy proceedings we expect to achieve nextera energy s adjusted eps expectations that i just outlined and will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver growth at or near the top of our 6 to 8 compound annual growth rate range up our 2018 base of 7 70 plus the expected deal accretion from the florida transactions we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12 to 14 per year through at least 2020 of 2017 base of dividends per share of 3 93 as always our expectations are to usual core caveats included but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions let me now turn to nep which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2018 yesterday the nep board declared a quarterly distribution of 0 465 per common unit or 1 86 per unit on an annualized basis up 15 from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2018 for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda and cafd increased 18 and 36 respectively primarily as a result of portfolio growth in addition to meeting nep s growth objectives with the acquisition from energy resources during 2018 we were also pleased to announce the execution of a long term contract that enables an expansion investment in the texas pipelines the opportunity which is subject to regulatory approval is expected to be in service during the fourth quarter of 2020 demonstrates the organic growth potential of nep s underlying portfolio beyond the attractive low cost convertible portfolio of equity financing of blackrock nep took additional steps to further enhance its financing flexibility during 2018 in the fourth quarter nep entered into an additional 1 billion interest rate hedge agreement to help mitigate interest rate volatility on future debt issuances this hedge agreement has a fixed rate of approximately 3 95 and could be flexibly utilized in any date until december 11 2028 the swap is incremental to the 5 billion hedge agreement that we announced last year providing significant protection against interest rate risk and nep executes on its long term growth plan as nep executes on its long term growth plan additionally during 2018 we successfully raised approximately 85 million through the sale of roughly 1 8 million common units under nep s atm program going forward we will continue to flexibly seek opportunities to use the atm program depending on market conditions and other considerations now let s look at the detailed results fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 165 million and cash available for distribution was 44 million a decrease of 35 million and 33 million from the prior year comparable quarter respectively the decline was primarily driven by the sale of the canadian portfolio earlier in the year with those assets not replaced until the late december closing on the 1 4 gigawatt acquisition from energy resources for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda and cafd were 881 million and 339 million up 18 and 36 respectively primarily driven by growth of the underlying portfolio existing projects benefited from increased contributions from texas pipeline s versus the prior year for adjusted ebitda this benefit was offset by the year over year reduction in the pre tax of nep s tax credit as a result of the decline in the federal income tax rate this change has no income no impact on cafd cash available for distribution from existing projects also benefited from reduced debt service which was roughly offset by higher corporate level interest expense as a reminder these results include the impact of idr fees which we treat as an operating expense additional details are shown on the accompanying slides for nep absent any impact from a pge bankruptcy filing our december 31 2018 run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda of 1 billion to 1 15 billion and cafd of 360 million to 400 million are unchanged reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the portfolio with which we ended the year our previously announced december 31 2019 run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda of 1 2 billion to 1 375 billion and cafd of 410 million to 480 million are also unchanged our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense from an updated base of our fourth quarter 2018 distribution per common unit and annualized rate of 1 86 we continue to seek 12 to 15 per year growth in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023 we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2019 distribution as payable on february 2021 to be in the range of 2 08 to 2 14 per common unit nep expects to be able to manage through the impacts of the anticipated pg e bankruptcy and to achieve the growth expectations that i just outlined as we have previously disclosed the 420 megawatts of projects that are contracted with pg e represents 15 to 18 of nep s expected year end 2018 run rate cash available for distribution as a result of the pg e board of directors authorizing the commitment commencement of a bankruptcy filing we believe an event of default is likely occurred under the genesis financing the administrative agent for the desert sunlight 300 financing has notified if an event of default has occurred under those agreements which we dispute and they are currently withholding the january distribution for any financing or an event of default is determined to have occurred cash distributions can be restricted and other remedies could be exercised including acceleration of the debt additionally due to provisions of the financings an event of default under desert sunlight 300 financing can prevent distributions from desert sunlight 250 which has contracted with sce we expect the combination of desert sunlight 250 and the pg e projects to contribute roughly 18 of nep s year end 2019 run rate cafd as we execute on nep s growth strategy we expect this to further decline over time and that the pg e projects and desert sunlight 250 will now represent a significant percentage of nep s 2023 cash available for distribution for projects where cash distributions are restricted we expected over time these funds will go toward paying down the principal on existing financings which would potentially result to more distributable cash flow to nep in the future in each of these projects we are reviewing our alternatives and will pursue all options to protect our interest including vigorously defending our contracts and working with key stakeholders of each financing even in the worst case scenario where we received no further contributions from projects that are contracted with pg e or desert sunlight 250 we can continue to expect that nep will achieve its annual 12 to 15 growth distributions per unit through 2023 without the need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest of to modest to aftermarket issuances we are pleased with nep s strong performance in 2018 and believe it continues to provide a best in class investor value proposition with the flexibility to grow in three ways acquiring assets from energy resources organically or acquiring assets from other third parties nep has clear visibility to support its growth going forward following a new record renewables origination year by energy resources and the continued strength of the best renewables development environment in our history nep s growth visibility further improved in 2018 additionally nep s cost to capital and access to capital advantages further improved over the past year providing flexibility to finance its growth over the long term when nep s growth potential and financing flexibility are combined with its favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights we believe nep is well positioned to meet its financial expectations and we look forward to delivering on nep s strategic and growth initiatives in 2019 and beyond that concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the lines for questions questions and answers operator and we will go first to stephen byrd of morgan stanley stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst hi good morning john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer hey good morning stephen stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst armando congratulations on your retirement and john and rebecca congratulations on your new role all very well deserved armando pimentel president and chief executive officer thank you stephen stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst i wanted to just talk as you can imagine about california for a minute if all of the project that essentially withheld cash to the arguably to the extent that they were would be permitted i wanted to make sure i was clear how much cafd would be restricted you mentioned 18 related to several projects but i wanted to check if every single piece of debt relating to pg e sort of exercise their cash drop right what amount of cafd will be impacted john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes so again it would comprise roughly 18 of our run rate cafd for 2019 we have included a page in our investor materials that page 41 page 41 that details cafd from each of these projects it totals about 90 million stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst understood john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer so let s go back to what i just said which is that first of all even if all of that cash is trapped we expect to be able to meet our financial expectations 12 to 15 growth and distributions per unit through 2023 we expect we will not have a need to issue common equity until 2020 at the earliest so our financial expectations are not impacted by any means by this second the impact of pg e and se cash flow is going to diminish over time so by the time we get to the end of the period of our financial expectations the cash flows from these projects is not going to be significant contributor to the overall cafd and then i think you have to take a look stephen at what is happening in california i mean obviously we re not going to sit on our heels we re going to pursue all avenues with our noteholders to try to free up that cash and we work vigorously to be that as i said in the prepared remarks stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst that all make sense and john in terms of any exposure to other california utilities i m thinking of edison international and sempre i just wanted to check both nep and nextera would you mind just speaking briefly to your other california exposure john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes so on our other california exposures with se i mean right now we don t have any because there is none of those financings are default other than sce contract that i mentioned which was about 250 megawatts on desert sunlight because that s part of the portfolio financing but again the impacts of that are included in the numbers that i gave you earlier so the 250 impact is included in the 0 13 to 0 15 at nextera energy it is also included in the roughly 18 of total cafd for 2019 stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst ok but do you have any cafd exposure not in default but where the offtaker is subsidiary either edison international or sebra john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer no zero at nep stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst great just wanted to check and nextera is that significant or relatively small john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer its relatively small i mean the contribution that we would have from sce contracts are roughly 0 08 and that includes the desert sunlight 250 so without it it s about 0 06 so small stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst understood sorry for all the questions in california maybe just one last one you filed at ferc to sort of secure your legal rights under the contracts would do kind of briefly talking through your legal arguments around ensuring that you protect your rights under your contracts john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes the bottom line is we think majority of those contracts have mobile cre provisions and these contracts are in public interest and that the federal power act pre empts what the bankruptcy courts can do and ferc has the final say on an assumption or rejection stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst that s very good that s all i had thank you very much operator we will now go to our next question and that will come from steve fishman of wolfe research steve fishman wolfe research analyst good morning so just first on the nep plan i assume you re embedded and you re assuming that you can continue to get financing other than equity i assume including some of like private financing converts and such that you ve gone in the past how do you feel about the ability to get those with this california uncertainty john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer first of all on the financing like the blackrock financing still feel good about our ability to be able to execute against those types of financings and again we also have a lot of debt capacity at nep that we can always fall back on as well steve fishman wolfe research analyst ok and then just separate question off topic could you update your interest in thoughts and interest in sandy cooper jim robo chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks steve this is jim we did put a proposal in acquire sandy cooper i think i ve been very clear to that we have been interested in pursuing sandy cooper over the last 18 months or so and we did put a proposal into acquire it and we look forward to the next steps of the process that the committee is going to be going through steve fishman wolfe research analyst do you have any idea when you ll get an answer jim robo chairman and chief executive officer you know i think this is a process that ultimately have to if the legislature decides to sell sandy cooper it s going to have to actually ask a lot to do essentially and the legislative session ends at the end of may or june in that time period so it s going to play out over the next several months is the bottom line steve steve fishman wolfe research analyst ok armando best to you thank you armando pimentel president and chief executive officer thanks steve operator and now we will go to julien dumoulin smith from bank of america merrill lynch julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning congrats armando can you hear me armando pimentel president and chief executive officer yes thanks julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst good well just one quick clarification on the ferc strategy and nep and then i move away from it but just if there is indeed some kind of stay how does that impact the technical faults and the possibility of distribution i just want to clarify that for cash and pg e for that matter john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes from a ferc standpoint if there were a ferc well first of all if ferc were to ramp the release that we re seeking by the end of the week i think it just would grant ferc the final say and what happens to the contract so i don t think it really has any impact on the status of the existing financings julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it ok fair enough excellent and then i just want to turn back to fpl real quickly specifically on the last call you talked about having should we say adequate reserve amortization you also talked about usage trends etc and the ability to potentially avoid for increases in 21 and 22 where does that stand now how is that all is that impacted by some of the latest events just curious on how you re positioning fpl into the longer term here john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes i don t think it s impacted by any of the current events we feel very good very good about our position in front of the opc if that julien was what you re referring to other events we ve been julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst or over may be more specific would you be expecting to end something more formal about a further rate there john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer well here s where we are right now we have 540 million of surplus ending the year we have we believe and expect to have enough surplus to potentially stay out of rate case for 21 and 22 we will make those strategic rate case decisions later but we have a lot of flexibility and that flexibility is a very good for florida customers because the longer we are able to stay out the longer period of time that stay where they are and they don t see a bill impact from another rate case jim robo chairman and chief executive officer julian this is jim i think you can expect us to give you all some more thoughts on that fronts in the june investor conference julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent and then maybe jim this is a quick question in your direction but as you ve been kind of conceptually especially given the commitments in the last analyst day around midstream potentially some of the latest developments you ve already alluded to around renewables especially some of the rps expansion that might be coming in the next six months prior to the june analyst day could you give us a little bit of your latest thought process around your future investment prospects just a little bit more holistically john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes sure i mean when you look at our capital investment plan i think they are over 12 billion this year when you look at what we re doing at fpl and energy resources combined something in that range we are as of the year before last we don t have the details yet on last year we were the fourth largest investor of capital in the united states and any industry only at t verizon and amazon invested more in this country than we did in terms of capital investment and we re going to continue to do what we have done for more than a decade which is invest smart capital at fpl to improve the value proposition for customers and we re going to we re very excited about and will have more to say about what we re doing at gulf in our june meeting but we have hit the ground running very excited about what we re doing in terms of what investment prospects are on the gulf front and we re moving aggressively forward on that pretty much on day one and in energy resources it is the best renewable environment that we ll never ever seen and we re ever going to invest in renewables going forward and as we see pipeline opportunities contacted pipeline opportunities we ll continue to invest in those as well i don t think you should expect a big change in our thinking in june i think you ll just see us frankly go forward our vision for the amount of investment and the amount of customer improvement that we re going to bring to our customers as well as the amount of what we re going to do in terms of earnings going forward julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst i ll leave it there thank you very much mark truscott director of investor relations thanks julien operator we will now go to craig gordon from evercore isi craig gordon evercor isi analyst congratulations to all three of you goes without saying you are all terrific at you jobs and armando someone asked me to ask you if you get circle back with people and tell us where you like to fish that would be good armando pimentel president and chief executive officer that s coming craig gordon evercor isi analyst a couple of questions can you just go back over what you said about the levelized cost of energy for battery with storage and what i m particularly interested other than restatement of that is what delivery year you see that crossover happening on sort of a large enough scale to take this sort of disruptive transition that you re talking about john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes so what we covered in a jim s remark let me start with wind so wind we are expecting to be right around 20 25 a megawatt hour i kind of put that ramps and ptc this is a no incentive look so call it when those incentives expire more toward the middle of the decade that 2024 time frame so 20 25 megawatt for wind and we think batteries are going to be about 0 05 to 0 075 adder and so that s how we re able to i m sorry per megawatt that s how we re able to get to the ranges that jim provided for wind so just take the 20 to 25 add on five to seven for battery storage for solar don t forget we have a solar itc at 30 through the end of 2023 and so when those itc s go away and they don t ever go away right they go from 30 to 10 we re expecting that solar given how quickly panel costs are coming down balance of plans costs are coming down solar is a product we re going to selling in 25 to 30 a megawatt hour range and then the same adders for batteries is how you get to the math that were in jim s remarks and those are the expectations we have and the solar pricing isn t really all that far off from what we re doing today so that s not much of a leap of faith craig gordon evercor isi analyst yes that makes sense i appreciate it last question you didn t mention it explicitly anywhere in your comments but the balance sheet capacity of 5 billion to 7 billion i mean your credit metrics and the position on the balance sheet seems unchanged from last quarter so i would assume that you still feel like that balance sheet capacity is in place john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes and and gordon craig one of the things that we said there is that we have five to seven right we bought trans bay those are 1 billion so we took that down call it four to six and where you re marking probably another 2 billion of capex opportunities for fpl we ll update where exactly that will be used on our june conference but certainly some of that money is going to go toward the 30 by 30 initiative that we already announced earlier last week craig gordon evercor isi analyst got you great update thank you guys operator we now will go to michael lapides of goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys obviously armando congrats on your announcement and to the rest of the team to john rebecca as well great to see people move around and given new opportunities one question about florida ballet initiative is being pushed right now can you just talk about what is actually in that ballot initiative what it would mean if it were garner the votes and what s the process from here jim robo chairman and chief executive officer yes i m going to turn that question over to eric eric silagy president and chief executive officer of florida power light company yes michael how are you doing today michael lapides goldman sachs analyst i m great eric thanks for taking this one eric silagy president and chief executive officer of florida power light company yes no problem the ballot initiative it is being framed as about helping florida customer but it s not about that at all when you look at it it s really about furthering the business interests of a few folks including a retail electric provider that s located in gaynesville that markets powered currently outside of florida this is a group that try to successfully to get this proposal in front of voters through the constitution revision commission and also through the unsuccessfully have tried through legislation in tallahassee their efforts have been successful in the past because frankly florida s regulated electricity market works really well it s our when you look at the state the power prices are among the lowest in the nation with electricity that s among the cleanest and most reliable in the country as an example florida power light offers our customers bills that are more than 30 lower than the national average lower than bills in 45 states and as john said earlier we re just recognized third time in four years as the most reliable electric provider in the country which is you could appreciate and important when our customers need us most particularly during times of storms and hurricanes so quite simply it s a proposal that it just actually it will lead to increases in electric rates across the state reduce reliability particularly during periods of storms hurricanes and things of that nature and i think it s going to compromise the clean energy goals that have been announced including the one we just said on fpl said 30 by 30 initiative as the unregulated power producers would they have no restrictions on the type of generation that they would build also i think it s important to understand on these type of things that consumer protection are removed you no longer applaud public service commission role in determining what rates are they will no longer be viewed as just and reasonable it s not sustainable go out of the window and that s going to impact reliability as well the ability of customers this language would actually prohibit customers from being able to buy power from existing utilities so florida power and light customers would not be able to continue to be customers of florida power light there are some other areas too that i think needs a lot of focus on including the fact that franchise fees which we collect and pay to municipalities across the state would be eliminated and that is significant amount of revenue that would no longer be available to pay for things like first responders firefighters police hospital employees of these municipalities that everybody counts on even if you look at now on attorney generals in a number of other states have called for the end of deregulation due to all the consumer complaints and the deceptive trade practices so there is a lot of reasons why these proposals have failed across the country since frankly the early 2000s you look at including even recently in nevada we have failed there s when you look at other states that look at this they a lot of them backed away particularly after the california crisis when enron moved into california take advantage of their so called market based model which resulted any catalyst for that crisis and having some of the highest power prices in the country so i don t think it s by accident that there hasn t been a state capacity regulation since the california power crisis which occurred now nearly 20 years ago so there s a number of hurdles to answer your question they have to be clear for this proposal to go forward to be placed on a ballot we re going to be very actively engaged we re going to be educating on the true motives of the specialist groups and we re going to also spend a lot of time educating folks on the significant negative impacts that this failed idea would have on the state and on their pocketbooks michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you eric i appreciate that i have one other for either jim john or armando when you re in and this is more longer term when you re watching what s happening in california with pg a with edison international or and put california in the context of being the nation s largest renewable market and with the most aggressive renewable target how do you think this impacts the broader u s development of renewables if one of the largest markets is going to some turmoil and how do you think about that kind of longer term john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer so great question michael i think one of the first thing i d say is california have some very aggressive renewable targets and some very aggressive climate change goals the turmoil around the credit of the most important counter parties in the state this to say the least is not conducive to the continued capital investment to continue to further those goals and so i think it s from an energy policy standpoint in the state of california it s going to be very important for the state to recognize that and to recognize that there s been significant capital investment by companies from around the world to make that happen and to the extent that that investment is somehow diminished by these credit issues i think that s going to have real impact on your market going forward and i think the state understands that and it s one of the elements and things that they are grappling now is the deal with the fall out fires as well as some of the other issues that they ve been facing so the good news from a market standpoint is california was obviously the biggest market in the country 10 years ago in the renewable business it isn t anymore it s an important market but it s no longer the most important market in the country and with the cost declines in renewables nearly every state in the country is in the we have an opportunity to do business i think we have my last we have development going on in 48 states right now we don t have have operating projects in 48 states but we have development going on in 48 states so while i think it s very important for the state to address these issues from a climate change standpoint going forward i think the renewable market is going to be robust going forward because it is just gotten so big and the cost declines have expanded the market to such a dramatic fashion operator and with that we ll go now to jonathan arnold of deutsche bank jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my question john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer hey good morning jonathan jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst so a quick question on this is how i think about your you talked about managing through the situations at nep in context of growth rate so as we think about things you might do that would fall under that header you mentioned pushing to have the cash released and i guess you can drop down other assets more quickly you could let the dividend drift down in the range and still be within 12 to 15 is there anything else that i m missing and which of those kind of alternatives or would you either be planning to use or not use john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes i think i ll go first of all back to prior one of the prior questions about are there other attractive financing vehicles available one yes we think there are but two even if we have the finance additional drops to meet our financial expectations with existing debt capacity that we have we can do that we re fine and so really the way i would answer that question is that obviously we re vigorously try to put to negotiate something what the holders that would have allow us to and the doe don t forget the doe is in these projects that allow us to free up the cash we can t do that we have debt capacity plenty of debt capacity at nep energy resources is coming off the best development year in its history we have very clear visibility to grow prospects going forward and there are many levels in the vehicle so we are comfortable in our ability to manage through even a worst case scenario which would be where the cash is trapped until the final call is made on the contracts jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst ok so but john just on i think to be clear you said in some of them the cash is trap just by virtue of pg e saying they may file is that correct and i m just curious john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes not getting into the technicalities but one of the financings has a provision that basically just says if there is corporate action taken and further into the bankruptcy which are filing of the 8 k to be that that would constitute potentially constitute an event of default jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst but that s just on one of them john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer it s on the genesis financing it s on some of the other financing but the financings are small to a series of four or five projects that don t have any meaningful contribution or earnings jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst so there would would be sort of a judgment as to what would definitively constitute that not occurring presumably john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes it doesn t happen and i think it s back to business as usual armando pimentel president and chief executive officer jonathan let me just add just let me add something i mean obviously i think it s appropriate for the focus on the pg e assets and the cash flow but we still have at both nextera energy resources and nextera energy partners we still have a lot of projects that are not pg e in southern california edison projects that have significant cash flows and there are still many parties that are interested in attractive financing attractive for us and presumably for them that we re talking to and it s not necessarily about what s the risk of pg e in southern california edison it s about hey what other assets are available for us to be able to enter into those types of financing so i think while it s appropriate to have some focus on what s going on with pg e we got to remember that nextera energy resources has added we have 6 600 megawatts of origination this year which is a record year and that s twice the amount we had last year which was a record year and i got to tell you we feel at least internally very comfortable as john said that even if these pg e cash flows are tied up in these debt financings that we can meet our current expectations and one of the reasons that we feel that way is because we re talking to the market and two origination is going very well in energy resources jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst great that s helpful perspective thank you armando and then could i just add one more other thing we would with the gulf and florida acquisitions have been closed sooner i think than maybe you thought is there but you re not talking or of any accretion in 19 or just help us to understand the bump in 20 what s striving that and why nothing this year armando pimentel president and chief executive officer so jonathan obviously we got it done earlier than we thought but we also always assume we would have some cost to achieve this year to get there so we re being conservative as we always are and we feel very good about our plans at gulf and you can bet i am pushing the team very hard so get things done even faster than we ve laid out and so i m really optimistic about the future for gulf in this company and in our ability to bring real value to their customer and real value to shareholders so very excited about it we ll have more to talk about it in june but remember we don t have any cost to achieve in any of these numbers in 19 so jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst thank you very much

the weekly bottom line u s highlights global equity markets are up on the week despite some negative economic news and continued dysfunction in washington the ecb characterized the economic risks as to the downside and will be more cautious removing stimulus amidst the u s partial government shutdown there was little data to unpack home sales showed a sour end to 2018 for real estate negotiations in congress continue but there is no clear end to the impasse at time of writing next week we get some key events an fomc rate decision with a press conference and a payrolls report furloughed federal workers are expected to lift the unemployment rate but should not affect the payrolls tally canadian highlights the tsx and canadian dollar traded sideways this week hanging onto recent gains still the wcs heavy oil price pushed higher and is up markedly compared to its november trough a good news story for the beleaguered oil sector economic data released this week reinforced the slowing growth narrative with wholesale activity manufacturing sales and retail spending falling in november the disappointing reports also caused us to shave our q4 growth forecast this softer economic backdrop should keep the bank of canada on hold at least until july u s markets up despite lack of good news on the economy global equity markets are up on the week despite some negative economic news and continued dysfunction in washington most notably mario draghi said that the risks to growth have moved to the downside and the ecb will be even more cautious withdrawing stimulus this more cautious view was supported by recent data which showed worsening sentiment in the manufacturing sector and in its leading economy chart 1 we also got confirmation that china s economy slowed dramatically in the second half of 2018 chart2 the rebalancing of china s economy towards domestic consumption is underway but the downward pressure from weaker construction and infrastructure investment on headline growth is being exacerbated by unanticipated declines in consumer and business sentiment resulting from trade tensions with the u s so far the data remains consistent with our december forecast that calls for chinese economic growth to slow further to 6 2 in 2019 with the u s partial government shutdown affecting some government statistical agencies there was little economic data this week we did see that the resale housing market ended 2018 on a weak note but we don t know what the housing starts or permit picture looked like looking ahead to next week the closely watched advance release of q4 real gdp growth is likely to be delayed the incomplete picture of the u s economy is coming at an inconvenient time economists are trying to determine if the weakness in financial markets in the fourth quarter which has already contributed to dampened consumer and business sentiment in survey data is also showing up in real measures of spending and activity the federal reserve will still meet next week amidst the shutdown we will get to hear from chair powell at a post meeting press conference as the fed moves to holding a press conference at every meeting the fed is widely expected to keep rates steady consistent with recent speeches which emphasized the ability to be patient to see how the economy fares in the wake of slower global growth and the deterioration in sentiment fortunately we are not in a total data vacuum next week the bls will release employment data where we will see if the blistering hiring activity in december carried over into january as legislation has been passed guaranteeing furloughed federal workers back pay to cover the shutdown these workers will not dampen the payrolls tally however they are still likely to boost the unemployment rate the reference week for the household survey was january 6 12th and furloughed federal employees 0 2 of the labor force would be classified as unemployed assuming federal workers are appropriately sampled in the survey this could result in a 0 2 percentage point boost to the january unemployment rate meanwhile the economic hit from the shutdown continues to mount growth in the first quarter is looking soft at 1 4 annualized assuming a 0 2 pt direct hit from the shutdown if it lasts to the end of january canada data confirms slowing growth narrative the tsx and canadian dollar traded sideways this week hanging on to recent gains still the trend remains a friend with both asset classes significantly off the lows seen late last month meanwhile the price of wcs oil pushed higher during the week and is up over 200 compared to its november trough a good news story for the beleaguered oil sector on the data front the news was less encouraging as economy watchers were delivered a trio of disappointing reports wholesale activity manufacturing sales and retail spending all declined in november consistent with the softer economic backdrop expected by the bank of canada and prompting a modest downward revision to our fourth quarter growth forecast manufacturing activity came in shy of expectations with volumes dropping 0 9 the petroleum and coal sector was the chief culprit chart 1 with maintenance and turnaround work contributing to an outsized decline in sales the immediate outlook for this sector is no brighter with alberta s oil production curtailment plan commencing on january 1st stripping out the petroleum and coal sector the picture was a little bit brighter with manufacturing sales edging 0 2 higher peering ahead manufacturing should find support from still solid u s demand and a low flying loonie giving aid to the much needed rotation from consumer spending to investment and export led growth however the aforementioned oil production cuts will exert a significant near term drag on manufacturing output and overall gdp growth november was another weak month for retail spending chart 2 with households feeling the pinch of rising interest rates retail volumes dropped 0 4 during the month weighed down by falling motor vehicle and parts sales sales in this rate sensitive sector are now tracking a modest year to date drop through november a marked change from the 6 gain averaged the prior three years the impact of rising borrowing costs is also being felt at retailers tied to housing markets volumes at building material and garden equipment supplies stores dropped for the fifth straight month in november sales of these items are now down 3 9 compared to a year ago the worst performance since 2013 not to be outdone sales at furniture and home furnishing stores were also significantly lower year on year in november going forward household spending will likely remain muted through 2019 as debt burdened households contend with rising borrowing costs putting it all together the dataflow suggests that overall economic activity likely pulled back in november and for fourth quarter as a whole will come in softer than previously anticipated we now expect growth closer to the 1 mark not far off the bank of canada s estimate of 1 3 this softer economic backdrop combined with well contained inflation should keep a patient bank of canada in wait and see mode for some time yet u s upcoming key economic releases u s employment january release date february 1 2019 previous 312k unemployment rate 3 9 td forecast 150k unemployment rate 4 0 consensus 160k unemployment rate 3 9 td expects payrolls to mean revert to 150k in january following the eye popping jump to 312k in december in effect we expect some of last month s unexpected gains in employment to be given back in january in particular we see scope for softness in the manufacturing sector after three consecutive months of solid payroll gains and as supported by the regional fed surveys which point to some weakness in the sector in addition employment in the retail sector may also revert back following a strong hiring streak during the holiday season november december weaker employment signal may also be exhibited in the household survey as a consequence of furloughed federal employees due to the ongoing government shutdown indeed we anticipate the unemployment rate to reflect this by a tick up to 4 0 in january and we see further risks to the upside lastly we expect wages to keep their momentum and rise 0 3 m m maintaining the annual print unchanged at 3 2 in january u s ism manufacturing january release date february 1 2019 previous 54 1 td forecast 53 3 consensus 54 3 ism adjusted regional surveys suggest the manufacturing ism likely fell further in january following the sharp 5 2 decline in december in particular both the adjusted empire and the philly fed manufacturing surveys pointed to further softness at the start of the year although our forecast currently stands below consensus expectations we note that at that level the ism index would remain in expansionary territory that still suggests above trend gdp growth based on the surveys we expect the inventory and employment components to lead the decline while new orders has the potential to stabilize following its large decline in december canada upcoming key economic releases canadian real gdp november release date january 31 2019 previous 0 3 td forecast 0 1 consensus n a the canadian economy is projected to take a step backward in november with a 0 1 decline in industry level gdp early signs are pointing towards a broad slowdown in activity as headwinds emerge across both goods and services energy will be an acute source of pain reflecting voluntary shut ins across the oil sands as producers grappled with blowout spreads on canadian crude oil weaker construction and manufacturing activity will weigh further on output from the goods producing sector while services will contend with a pullback in real retail and wholesale sales alongside ongoing softness in existing home sales given uncertainty around the impact of crude oil shutdowns we view risks as tilted to the downside although the 0 3 increase from october will help blunt the impact on q4 growth the boc has already set a relatively low bar at 1 3 but a 0 1 decline would likely imply a growth tracking closer to the 1 mark

further expand nextera energy s regulated business mix through the addition of attractive electric and natural gas franchises by executing on the same long term strategy that we ve deployed at fpl we expect the acquisitions to benefit customers shareholders and the florida economy the energy resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2018 the renewables origination success was particularly strong as the team added approximately 6 500 megawatts including storage and repowering to our backlog over the past year this represents the most successful origination year in our history and is nearly twice as many megawatts as we originated in 2017 our prior record year our ongoing renewable origination success results from operating from what we believe to be the best renewables development environment in our history in our ability to leverage energy resources competitive advantages these competitive advantages include our best in class development skills strong customer relationships purchasing power best in class construction expertise resources capabilities strong access to and cost of capital advantages and the ability to combine wind solar and battery storage into integrated newly form low cost products during the year we were pleased to receive the irs target construction guidance on the solar itc which we believe positions us well for substantial solar and storage growth well into the next decade in 2018 more than 40 of the solar projects that were added to our backlog included a battery storage complement highlighting the beginning of the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution with continued technology improvements and cost declines we expect that without incentives wind is going to be a 0 02 to 0 025 per kilowatt per hour product and solar is going to be 0 025 to 0 03 per kilowatt hour product early in the next decade combining these extremely low cost with one half to three quarter cent adder for a four hour storage system will create a nearly renewable generation resource that is cheaper than the operating cost of coal nuclear and less fuel efficient oil and gas fired generation units we continue to believe that this will be massively disruptive to the nations generation fleet and create significant opportunities for renewable growth well into the next decade consistent with our focus on growing our rate regulated and long term contracted business operations during the fourth quarter nextera energy transmission announced an agreement to acquire trans bay cable a 53 mile high voltage direct current underwater transmission cable system with utility rate set by ferc which provides approximately 40 of san francisco s daily electric power needs subject to regulatory approvals approximately 1 billion acquisition including the assumption of debt is expected to close later this year and to be immediately accretive to earnings the proposed acquisition combined with the mid continent independent system operator selection of nextera energy transmission to develop the approximately 20 mile single circuit 500 kv hartburg sabine junction transmission line is east texas it furthers our goal of creating america s leading competitive transmission company in addition to successfully growing our regulated operations both organically and through acquisitions through 2018 we further strengthened energy resources existing portfolio during the year in december the connecticut department of energy and environmental protection selected approximately 20 of the seabrook nuclear plants generation and 80 megawatts of new solar projects which are not yet included in our backlog for long term contracts by operating one of the top performing nuclear plants in the nation energy resources expects to provide significant amounts of carbon free energy at prices generally in line with current curves while generating attractive shareholder returns as a result seabrook s contract pricing is expected to be roughly 50 lower than the cost of offshore wind generating significant savings for connecticut customers over the 8 year contract term the seabrook award compliments energy resources exited the merchant business which we began back in 2011 and essentially completed in 2016 with the sale of our forney lamar and marcus hook natural gas generation assets excluding seabrook the remaining merchant generation assets contribute less than 1 of nextera energy s consolidated adjusted ebitda going forward we expect this contribution to decline as the focus remains on regulated and long term contracted opportunities in renewables natural gas pipelines and regulated transmission as always we will continue to opportunistically evaluate recycling capital through sales of nonstrategic assets in our portfolio including the remaining fossil generation assets fund additional growth of long term contracted businesses as a result of increasing the expected adjusted earnings contribution from rate regulated businesses to roughly 70 and the steps that we have taken to further de risk the energy resources portfolio s p announced earlier this month that they have revised their assessment of nextera energy s business risk profile upward from strong to excellent as a result of this improvement s p reduced nextera energy s ffo to debt downgrade threshold from 23 to 21 this follows moody s announcement last year that with the expansion of the company s regulated operations to roughly 70 following the gulf power transaction nextera energy s cfo pre working capital to downgrade threshold would be reduced from 20 to 18 at these revised rating agency thresholds and following some utilization of balance sheet capacity for the trans bay transmission acquisition we now expect to maintain 4 billion to 46 billion of excess balance sheet capacity through 2021 while we have multiple alternatives for utilization we expect to use approximately 2 billion of this capacity in the near term to support additional regulated capital investments at fpl consistent with a significant incremental smart investment opportunities that exist at fpl last week we announced fpl s groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan to install more than 30 million solar panels by 2030 resulting in an incremental 10 000 megawatts of solar projects versus what is in operation in fpl today we will give further details on these and other potential investments which were mostly expected to help maintain our long term adjusted eps compound annual growth rate beyond 2021 at our investor conference which we plan to hold on june 20 in new york city following the strong results from 2018 i continue to believe that we have one of the best organic opportunity sets in execution track records in the industry i remain as enthusiastic as ever about our long term prospects and based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses i will be disappointed if we were not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6 to 8 compound annual growth range through 22021 plus the expected deal accretion from the florida transactions while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings let me now turn to nep which also had a terrific year of execution in 2018 as john will describe later in the call nep successfully delivered on its growth objectives for adjusted ebitda cafd and lp distributions during the year we recycled the proceeds from the sale of nep s canadian portfolio into a higher yielding u s portfolio that benefits from a more favorable tax position as a result of this accretive transaction nep extended its expectations for 12 to 15 per year dpu growth by one additional year to 2023 the 1 4 gigawatt renewable portfolio that was acquired from energy resources further enhanced the diversity of nep s existing portfolio and was financed through a combination of the canadian asset sale proceeds and a 750 million convertible equity portfolio financing with blackrock the financing demonstrates nep s ability to access additional low cost sources of capital to finance its growth and with the right to convert a minimum of 70 of the portfolio financing into nep units issued at no discount the transaction further reduces nep s equity needs going forward nep grew the lp distribution by 50 year over year and delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 4 in 2018 which is on the heels of a total unitholder return of over 75 the year prior nep outperformed both the s p 500 and the other yield curves by 7 on average and its total unitholder return was more than 15 higher than the illyrian nep index i continue to believe that a combination of nep s growth visibility along with its flexibility to finance that growth offers unitholders an attractive offer unitholders an attractive investor value proposition for these reasons nep is well positioned to continue executing on its growth objectives and delivering strong performance going forward before turning the call over to john i d like to announce some important organizational changes armando pimentel president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources and president and a member of board of directors of nextera energy partners will retire from each of its positions on march 1 of this year as part of planned leadership success process that began when armando shared his plan with me more than a year ago john ketchum currency executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy will replace armando as president and chief executive officer at nextera energy resources as part of john s new responsibilities he will continue to serve as a member of the board of directors of nep and will be appointed president of nextera energy partners rebecca currently vice president business management nextera energy resources will succeed john as execitive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy rebecca will also become a member of the board of directors of nep each of these changes will become effective on march 1st of this year armando has been an anonymous contributor to nextera energy success during his more than 10 years with the company helping building to build industry leading business during his tenure as ceo of energy resources his leadership his commercial judgment his financial discipline have all guided in energy resources through a period of a truly unprecedented growth and financial success armando s contribution set the company on a path to become what it is today the world s leading renewable energy company he s been a great friend colleague and a truly valued counselor to me personally and it s an understatement say i ll miss him i m also excited for armando and what will come next for him and his family in his retirement with regard to john s promotion i ve had the chance to work closely with john for more than 16 years as he have successfully progressed through a variety of different roles in our company we re fortunate to have a person of his capabilities vision and experience he s an exceptional leader who s emerged as one of the premier cfos in our sector and i ve tremendous faith that john is the ideal successor to lead the energy resources team into the future due to a strong financial acumen knowledge of the sector and passion for building a world leading energy company likewise rebecca has distinguished herself as a well rounded executive with a proven track record of execution outstanding finance and commercial skills and an unparalleled understanding of the nextera energy enterprise she has been instrumental and helping armando lead energy resources and develop our strategy for nep over the last several years and in our innovative analytical and strategic mindset to serve us well in her new role i m very happy to have rebecca as our new chief financial officer i ll now turn the call over to armando who would like to make some personal remarks armando pimentel president and chief executive officer thank you jim first i want to thank jim for providing me the opportunity to lead energy resources for the last 7 5 years and i want to thank those of you on the phone today who i ve had the privilege of meeting and interacting with since i began at nextera energy 2008 i thank you for the interactive dialogue and the opportunity to continue to tell our story and today there is no doubt that energy resources not only the largest developer operator and owner of renewable energy in the world but also its most profitable and innovative and as i tell our employees and customers i believe we re just getting started i strongly believe that the renewable energy opportunity is actually just beginning the combination of energy storage with wind and solar is a revolution which will expand opportunities for renewables and is very exciting i m profoundly comfortable in the continued success of energy resources nextera energy partners and nextera energy i want to thank all of our employees at nextera energy for providing me the opportunity to work alongside them i have learned and much over the years and will miss the innovative fast pace environment in which we work i have no concrete plans as of now but i m excited by pursuing new adventures and honing old skills at the very least retirement will allow me to pursue one of my great passions fishing thanks again to all of the few that have helped guide me and our company successfully over the years our company is in terrific shape and i congratulate and applaud john and rebecca on their new roles well deserved i will now turn the call over to john john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you armando and jim let s now turn to the detailed results beginning with fpl for the fourth quarter of 2018 fpl reported net income of 407 million or 0 85 per share up 0 01 per share compared to fpl s adjusted earnings in the prior year period for the full year 2018 fpl reported net income of 2 2 billion or 4 55 per share an increase of 0 46 per share versus fpl s adjusted earnings in 2017 regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 12 4 for 2018 and was a principal driver of fpl s adjusted net income growth of 12 5 for the full year fpl s capital expenditures were approximately 1 5 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly 5 1 billion fpl s reported roe for regulatory purposes was 11 6 for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9 6 to 11 6 under our current rate agreement during the fourth quarter we restored an additional 240 million of reserve amortization leaving fpl with a year end 2018 balance of 541 million we continue to expect that fpl will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years creating further customer benefits by potentially avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and perhaps 2022 before moving on let me now take a moment to update you on some of our key capital initiatives at fpl during 2018 fpl completed construction on schedule and on budget for the first eight 74 5 megawatt solar energy centers developed under the solar base rate adjustment or sbra mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement in 2018 we also deployed the first two projects under fpl s 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program pairing battery systems with existing solar project and highlighting fpl s innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of its clean energy solutions for customers the next 300 megawatts of solar projects being built under the silver mechanism remain on budget and on track to begin providing cost effective energy to fpl customers in early 2019 to support the significance solar expansion that fpl is leading across florida we have secured sites that could potentially support more than 7 gigawatts of future projects beyond solar construction on the approximately 1 750 megawatt okeechobee clean energy center remains on budget and on schedule to inner service in the middle of this year additionally the roughly 1 200 megawatt dania beach clean energy center received siting board approval during the quarter to support its projected commercial operation date in 2022 we continue to expect that fpl s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed net of accumulative deferred income taxes of approximately 9 from the start of a settlement agreement in january 2017 through at least december 2021 while further enhancing our customer value proposition the economy in florida remains healthy the current unemployment rate of 3 3 remains below the national average and at the lowest levels in a decade florida s consumer confidence level remains near 10 year highs the real estate sector also continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at healthy levels and the case shiller index for south florida home prices up 4 8 from the prior year fpl s fourth quarter retail sales increased 4 from the prior year comparable period we estimate that weather related usage per customer contributed approximately 0 6 to this amount on a weather normalized basis fourth quarter sales increased 3 4 with positive contributions from both weather normalized usage per customer and ongoing customer growth including the addition of vero beach s customers for 2018 we estimate that fpl s retail sales on a weather normalized basis increased by 2 6 continued customer growth and an estimated 1 7 increase in weather normalized usage per customer both contributed favorably while we are encouraged by the growth in underlying usage in 2018 which was a consistent benefit during all four quarters as we have often discussed this measure can be volatile and we are not yet ready to draw any firm conclusions about long term trends we ll continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and will update you on future calls let me now turn to energy resources which reported fourth quarter 2018 gaap earnings of 263 million or 0 55 per share adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were 317 million or 0 66 per share for the full year energy resources reported gaap earnings of 4 66 billion or 0 0975 per share and adjusted earnings of 1 46 billion or 3 05 per share in the fourth quarter energy resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share increased by 0 18 from the prior year comparable period positive contributions from new investments customer supply and trading our gas infrastructure business including pipelines and the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate all supported the strong year over year growth these favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our existing generation assets as a result of particularly poor fleet wide wind resource which was the lowest fourth quarter on record over the last 30 years and higher interest in corporate expenses due to growth in the business energy resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased 0 45 or approximately 17 versus 2017 for the full year contributions from the new investments declined by 0 04 per share due in part to the expected smaller than usual 2017 renewable build in 2019 and beyond we expect meaningful growth from new investments as we continue to execute on our renewables development backlog increased ptc volume from the approximately 1 600 megawatts of repowered wind projects that were commissioned in 2017 helped increased contribution from existing generation assets by 0 10 per share contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines increased by 0 17 per share year over year as expected the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate was accretive to energy resources increasing adjusted eps by 0 45 compared to 2017 all other impacts reduced results by 0 23 per share primarily as a result of higher interest and corporate expenses driven largely by increased development activity to support the favorable renewables development environment additional details are shown on the accompanying slide in 2018 energy resources continue to advance its position as a leading developer and operator of wind solar and battery storage projects commissioning nearly 2 700 megawatts of renewable projects in the u s including an additional 900 megawatts of repowered wind since the last call we have added 1 791 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog including 680 megawatts of wind 797 megawatts of solar and 215 megawatts of battery storage all of which will be paired with new solar projects included in the solar megawatts we added to backlog this quarter is 150 megawatt solar build owned transfer project with a 10 year loan agreement that will allow the customer to leverage energy resources best in class operating skills while providing meaningful ongoing revenue through the contract term during the quarter energy resources signed an additional 99 megawatts of repowering and successfully commissioned approximately 600 megawatts of repowering projects for 2017 and 2018 this brings the total repowering projects placed in service to roughly 2 500 megawatts near the top end of the previously outlined range for this period we continue to expect to be in the upper half of the 2 5 billion to 3 billion in total capital deployment for repowering for 2017 through 2020 following the record origination year in 2018 it was nearly two years remaining in the development year we are now within the previously outlined 2017 to 2020 ranges for u s wind solar and wind repowering for the post 2020 period our backlog is already nearly 2 000 megawatts placing us well ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage the accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands beyond renewables we completed the construction of approximately 175 miles of the mountain valley pipeline during 2018 as planned nvp is continuing with its scale back construction efforts for the winter while we continue to target our previously announced full in service state for the pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2019 and revised overall project cost estimate of 4 6 billion we also continue to work through the projects outstanding legal challenges and to closely monitor developments related to the atlanta coast pipeline and the current government shutdown as the outcome of any one of these issues could impact mvp s project schedule and cost estimate we also continue to evaluate mitigation alternators to address potential adverse outcomes should they arise mvp s expected annual contribution to nextera energy to ongoing adjusted eps is approximately 0 7 to 0 09 we do not expect any material adjusted earnings impacts nor any change in nextera energy s financial expectations as a result of the ongoing challenges we will provide further updates as those proceedings evolve turning now with the consolidated results for nextera energy for the fourth quarter 2018 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 422 million or 0 88 per share nextera energy s 2018 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were 718 million or 1 49 per share respectively for the full year 2018 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 6 64 billion or 13 88 per share adjusted earnings were 3 67 billion or 7 70 per share reflecting growth of 15 up our 2017 adjusted eps including an approximately 0 45 benefit from lower federal income taxes for the corporate and other segment adjusted earnings for the full year increased 0 09 per share compared to 2017 primarily due to lower interest and certain favorable tax items we continue to expect nextera energy s adjusted eps compound annual growth rate to be in the range of 6 to 8 through 2021 up our 2018 adjusted eps of 7 70 plus accretion of 0 15 and 0 20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the florida acquisitions for 2019 we continue to expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of 8 to 8 50 from 2018 to 2021 we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we re closely following the recent developments with specific gas and electric projects directly affected by the potential bankruptcy have an expected annual adjusted eps contribution of roughly 0 13 to 0 15 for nextera energy regardless of the outcome of pg e s anticipated bankruptcy proceedings we expect to achieve nextera energy s adjusted eps expectations that i just outlined and will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver growth at or near the top of our 6 to 8 compound annual growth rate range up our 2018 base of 7 70 plus the expected deal accretion from the florida transactions we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12 to 14 per year through at least 2020 of 2017 base of dividends per share of 3 93 as always our expectations are to usual core caveats included but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions let me now turn to nep which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2018 yesterday the nep board declared a quarterly distribution of 0 465 per common unit or 1 86 per unit on an annualized basis up 15 from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2018 for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda and cafd increased 18 and 36 respectively primarily as a result of portfolio growth in addition to meeting nep s growth objectives with the acquisition from energy resources during 2018 we were also pleased to announce the execution of a long term contract that enables an expansion investment in the texas pipelines the opportunity which is subject to regulatory approval is expected to be in service during the fourth quarter of 2020 demonstrates the organic growth potential of nep s underlying portfolio beyond the attractive low cost convertible portfolio of equity financing of blackrock nep took additional steps to further enhance its financing flexibility during 2018 in the fourth quarter nep entered into an additional 1 billion interest rate hedge agreement to help mitigate interest rate volatility on future debt issuances this hedge agreement has a fixed rate of approximately 3 95 and could be flexibly utilized in any date until december 11 2028 the swap is incremental to the 5 billion hedge agreement that we announced last year providing significant protection against interest rate risk and nep executes on its long term growth plan as nep executes on its long term growth plan additionally during 2018 we successfully raised approximately 85 million through the sale of roughly 1 8 million common units under nep s atm program going forward we will continue to flexibly seek opportunities to use the atm program depending on market conditions and other considerations now let s look at the detailed results fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 165 million and cash available for distribution was 44 million a decrease of 35 million and 33 million from the prior year comparable quarter respectively the decline was primarily driven by the sale of the canadian portfolio earlier in the year with those assets not replaced until the late december closing on the 1 4 gigawatt acquisition from energy resources for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda and cafd were 881 million and 339 million up 18 and 36 respectively primarily driven by growth of the underlying portfolio existing projects benefited from increased contributions from texas pipeline s versus the prior year for adjusted ebitda this benefit was offset by the year over year reduction in the pre tax of nep s tax credit as a result of the decline in the federal income tax rate this change has no income no impact on cafd cash available for distribution from existing projects also benefited from reduced debt service which was roughly offset by higher corporate level interest expense as a reminder these results include the impact of idr fees which we treat as an operating expense additional details are shown on the accompanying slides for nep absent any impact from a pge bankruptcy filing our december 31 2018 run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda of 1 billion to 1 15 billion and cafd of 360 million to 400 million are unchanged reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the portfolio with which we ended the year our previously announced december 31 2019 run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda of 1 2 billion to 1 375 billion and cafd of 410 million to 480 million are also unchanged our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense from an updated base of our fourth quarter 2018 distribution per common unit and annualized rate of 1 86 we continue to seek 12 to 15 per year growth in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023 we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2019 distribution as payable on february 2021 to be in the range of 2 08 to 2 14 per common unit nep expects to be able to manage through the impacts of the anticipated pg e bankruptcy and to achieve the growth expectations that i just outlined as we have previously disclosed the 420 megawatts of projects that are contracted with pg e represents 15 to 18 of nep s expected year end 2018 run rate cash available for distribution as a result of the pg e board of directors authorizing the commitment commencement of a bankruptcy filing we believe an event of default is likely occurred under the genesis financing the administrative agent for the desert sunlight 300 financing has notified if an event of default has occurred under those agreements which we dispute and they are currently withholding the january distribution for any financing or an event of default is determined to have occurred cash distributions can be restricted and other remedies could be exercised including acceleration of the debt additionally due to provisions of the financings an event of default under desert sunlight 300 financing can prevent distributions from desert sunlight 250 which has contracted with sce we expect the combination of desert sunlight 250 and the pg e projects to contribute roughly 18 of nep s year end 2019 run rate cafd as we execute on nep s growth strategy we expect this to further decline over time and that the pg e projects and desert sunlight 250 will now represent a significant percentage of nep s 2023 cash available for distribution for projects where cash distributions are restricted we expected over time these funds will go toward paying down the principal on existing financings which would potentially result to more distributable cash flow to nep in the future in each of these projects we are reviewing our alternatives and will pursue all options to protect our interest including vigorously defending our contracts and working with key stakeholders of each financing even in the worst case scenario where we received no further contributions from projects that are contracted with pg e or desert sunlight 250 we can continue to expect that nep will achieve its annual 12 to 15 growth distributions per unit through 2023 without the need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest of to modest to aftermarket issuances we are pleased with nep s strong performance in 2018 and believe it continues to provide a best in class investor value proposition with the flexibility to grow in three ways acquiring assets from energy resources organically or acquiring assets from other third parties nep has clear visibility to support its growth going forward following a new record renewables origination year by energy resources and the continued strength of the best renewables development environment in our history nep s growth visibility further improved in 2018 additionally nep s cost to capital and access to capital advantages further improved over the past year providing flexibility to finance its growth over the long term when nep s growth potential and financing flexibility are combined with its favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights we believe nep is well positioned to meet its financial expectations and we look forward to delivering on nep s strategic and growth initiatives in 2019 and beyond that concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the lines for questions questions and answers operator and we will go first to stephen byrd of morgan stanley stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst hi good morning john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer hey good morning stephen stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst armando congratulations on your retirement and john and rebecca congratulations on your new role all very well deserved armando pimentel president and chief executive officer thank you stephen stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst i wanted to just talk as you can imagine about california for a minute if all of the project that essentially withheld cash to the arguably to the extent that they were would be permitted i wanted to make sure i was clear how much cafd would be restricted you mentioned 18 related to several projects but i wanted to check if every single piece of debt relating to pg e sort of exercise their cash drop right what amount of cafd will be impacted john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes so again it would comprise roughly 18 of our run rate cafd for 2019 we have included a page in our investor materials that page 41 page 41 that details cafd from each of these projects it totals about 90 million stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst understood john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer so let s go back to what i just said which is that first of all even if all of that cash is trapped we expect to be able to meet our financial expectations 12 to 15 growth and distributions per unit through 2023 we expect we will not have a need to issue common equity until 2020 at the earliest so our financial expectations are not impacted by any means by this second the impact of pg e and se cash flow is going to diminish over time so by the time we get to the end of the period of our financial expectations the cash flows from these projects is not going to be significant contributor to the overall cafd and then i think you have to take a look stephen at what is happening in california i mean obviously we re not going to sit on our heels we re going to pursue all avenues with our noteholders to try to free up that cash and we work vigorously to be that as i said in the prepared remarks stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst that all make sense and john in terms of any exposure to other california utilities i m thinking of edison international and sempre i just wanted to check both nep and nextera would you mind just speaking briefly to your other california exposure john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes so on our other california exposures with se i mean right now we don t have any because there is none of those financings are default other than sce contract that i mentioned which was about 250 megawatts on desert sunlight because that s part of the portfolio financing but again the impacts of that are included in the numbers that i gave you earlier so the 250 impact is included in the 0 13 to 0 15 at nextera energy it is also included in the roughly 18 of total cafd for 2019 stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst ok but do you have any cafd exposure not in default but where the offtaker is subsidiary either edison international or sebra john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer no zero at nep stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst great just wanted to check and nextera is that significant or relatively small john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer its relatively small i mean the contribution that we would have from sce contracts are roughly 0 08 and that includes the desert sunlight 250 so without it it s about 0 06 so small stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst understood sorry for all the questions in california maybe just one last one you filed at ferc to sort of secure your legal rights under the contracts would do kind of briefly talking through your legal arguments around ensuring that you protect your rights under your contracts john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes the bottom line is we think majority of those contracts have mobile cre provisions and these contracts are in public interest and that the federal power act pre empts what the bankruptcy courts can do and ferc has the final say on an assumption or rejection stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst that s very good that s all i had thank you very much operator we will now go to our next question and that will come from steve fishman of wolfe research steve fishman wolfe research analyst good morning so just first on the nep plan i assume you re embedded and you re assuming that you can continue to get financing other than equity i assume including some of like private financing converts and such that you ve gone in the past how do you feel about the ability to get those with this california uncertainty john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer first of all on the financing like the blackrock financing still feel good about our ability to be able to execute against those types of financings and again we also have a lot of debt capacity at nep that we can always fall back on as well steve fishman wolfe research analyst ok and then just separate question off topic could you update your interest in thoughts and interest in sandy cooper jim robo chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks steve this is jim we did put a proposal in acquire sandy cooper i think i ve been very clear to that we have been interested in pursuing sandy cooper over the last 18 months or so and we did put a proposal into acquire it and we look forward to the next steps of the process that the committee is going to be going through steve fishman wolfe research analyst do you have any idea when you ll get an answer jim robo chairman and chief executive officer you know i think this is a process that ultimately have to if the legislature decides to sell sandy cooper it s going to have to actually ask a lot to do essentially and the legislative session ends at the end of may or june in that time period so it s going to play out over the next several months is the bottom line steve steve fishman wolfe research analyst ok armando best to you thank you armando pimentel president and chief executive officer thanks steve operator and now we will go to julien dumoulin smith from bank of america merrill lynch julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning congrats armando can you hear me armando pimentel president and chief executive officer yes thanks julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst good well just one quick clarification on the ferc strategy and nep and then i move away from it but just if there is indeed some kind of stay how does that impact the technical faults and the possibility of distribution i just want to clarify that for cash and pg e for that matter john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes from a ferc standpoint if there were a ferc well first of all if ferc were to ramp the release that we re seeking by the end of the week i think it just would grant ferc the final say and what happens to the contract so i don t think it really has any impact on the status of the existing financings julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it ok fair enough excellent and then i just want to turn back to fpl real quickly specifically on the last call you talked about having should we say adequate reserve amortization you also talked about usage trends etc and the ability to potentially avoid for increases in 21 and 22 where does that stand now how is that all is that impacted by some of the latest events just curious on how you re positioning fpl into the longer term here john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes i don t think it s impacted by any of the current events we feel very good very good about our position in front of the opc if that julien was what you re referring to other events we ve been julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst or over may be more specific would you be expecting to end something more formal about a further rate there john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer well here s where we are right now we have 540 million of surplus ending the year we have we believe and expect to have enough surplus to potentially stay out of rate case for 21 and 22 we will make those strategic rate case decisions later but we have a lot of flexibility and that flexibility is a very good for florida customers because the longer we are able to stay out the longer period of time that stay where they are and they don t see a bill impact from another rate case jim robo chairman and chief executive officer julian this is jim i think you can expect us to give you all some more thoughts on that fronts in the june investor conference julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent and then maybe jim this is a quick question in your direction but as you ve been kind of conceptually especially given the commitments in the last analyst day around midstream potentially some of the latest developments you ve already alluded to around renewables especially some of the rps expansion that might be coming in the next six months prior to the june analyst day could you give us a little bit of your latest thought process around your future investment prospects just a little bit more holistically john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes sure i mean when you look at our capital investment plan i think they are over 12 billion this year when you look at what we re doing at fpl and energy resources combined something in that range we are as of the year before last we don t have the details yet on last year we were the fourth largest investor of capital in the united states and any industry only at t verizon and amazon invested more in this country than we did in terms of capital investment and we re going to continue to do what we have done for more than a decade which is invest smart capital at fpl to improve the value proposition for customers and we re going to we re very excited about and will have more to say about what we re doing at gulf in our june meeting but we have hit the ground running very excited about what we re doing in terms of what investment prospects are on the gulf front and we re moving aggressively forward on that pretty much on day one and in energy resources it is the best renewable environment that we ll never ever seen and we re ever going to invest in renewables going forward and as we see pipeline opportunities contacted pipeline opportunities we ll continue to invest in those as well i don t think you should expect a big change in our thinking in june i think you ll just see us frankly go forward our vision for the amount of investment and the amount of customer improvement that we re going to bring to our customers as well as the amount of what we re going to do in terms of earnings going forward julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst i ll leave it there thank you very much mark truscott director of investor relations thanks julien operator we will now go to craig gordon from evercore isi craig gordon evercor isi analyst congratulations to all three of you goes without saying you are all terrific at you jobs and armando someone asked me to ask you if you get circle back with people and tell us where you like to fish that would be good armando pimentel president and chief executive officer that s coming craig gordon evercor isi analyst a couple of questions can you just go back over what you said about the levelized cost of energy for battery with storage and what i m particularly interested other than restatement of that is what delivery year you see that crossover happening on sort of a large enough scale to take this sort of disruptive transition that you re talking about john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes so what we covered in a jim s remark let me start with wind so wind we are expecting to be right around 20 25 a megawatt hour i kind of put that ramps and ptc this is a no incentive look so call it when those incentives expire more toward the middle of the decade that 2024 time frame so 20 25 megawatt for wind and we think batteries are going to be about 0 05 to 0 075 adder and so that s how we re able to i m sorry per megawatt that s how we re able to get to the ranges that jim provided for wind so just take the 20 to 25 add on five to seven for battery storage for solar don t forget we have a solar itc at 30 through the end of 2023 and so when those itc s go away and they don t ever go away right they go from 30 to 10 we re expecting that solar given how quickly panel costs are coming down balance of plans costs are coming down solar is a product we re going to selling in 25 to 30 a megawatt hour range and then the same adders for batteries is how you get to the math that were in jim s remarks and those are the expectations we have and the solar pricing isn t really all that far off from what we re doing today so that s not much of a leap of faith craig gordon evercor isi analyst yes that makes sense i appreciate it last question you didn t mention it explicitly anywhere in your comments but the balance sheet capacity of 5 billion to 7 billion i mean your credit metrics and the position on the balance sheet seems unchanged from last quarter so i would assume that you still feel like that balance sheet capacity is in place john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes and and gordon craig one of the things that we said there is that we have five to seven right we bought trans bay those are 1 billion so we took that down call it four to six and where you re marking probably another 2 billion of capex opportunities for fpl we ll update where exactly that will be used on our june conference but certainly some of that money is going to go toward the 30 by 30 initiative that we already announced earlier last week craig gordon evercor isi analyst got you great update thank you guys operator we now will go to michael lapides of goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys obviously armando congrats on your announcement and to the rest of the team to john rebecca as well great to see people move around and given new opportunities one question about florida ballet initiative is being pushed right now can you just talk about what is actually in that ballot initiative what it would mean if it were garner the votes and what s the process from here jim robo chairman and chief executive officer yes i m going to turn that question over to eric eric silagy president and chief executive officer of florida power light company yes michael how are you doing today michael lapides goldman sachs analyst i m great eric thanks for taking this one eric silagy president and chief executive officer of florida power light company yes no problem the ballot initiative it is being framed as about helping florida customer but it s not about that at all when you look at it it s really about furthering the business interests of a few folks including a retail electric provider that s located in gaynesville that markets powered currently outside of florida this is a group that try to successfully to get this proposal in front of voters through the constitution revision commission and also through the unsuccessfully have tried through legislation in tallahassee their efforts have been successful in the past because frankly florida s regulated electricity market works really well it s our when you look at the state the power prices are among the lowest in the nation with electricity that s among the cleanest and most reliable in the country as an example florida power light offers our customers bills that are more than 30 lower than the national average lower than bills in 45 states and as john said earlier we re just recognized third time in four years as the most reliable electric provider in the country which is you could appreciate and important when our customers need us most particularly during times of storms and hurricanes so quite simply it s a proposal that it just actually it will lead to increases in electric rates across the state reduce reliability particularly during periods of storms hurricanes and things of that nature and i think it s going to compromise the clean energy goals that have been announced including the one we just said on fpl said 30 by 30 initiative as the unregulated power producers would they have no restrictions on the type of generation that they would build also i think it s important to understand on these type of things that consumer protection are removed you no longer applaud public service commission role in determining what rates are they will no longer be viewed as just and reasonable it s not sustainable go out of the window and that s going to impact reliability as well the ability of customers this language would actually prohibit customers from being able to buy power from existing utilities so florida power and light customers would not be able to continue to be customers of florida power light there are some other areas too that i think needs a lot of focus on including the fact that franchise fees which we collect and pay to municipalities across the state would be eliminated and that is significant amount of revenue that would no longer be available to pay for things like first responders firefighters police hospital employees of these municipalities that everybody counts on even if you look at now on attorney generals in a number of other states have called for the end of deregulation due to all the consumer complaints and the deceptive trade practices so there is a lot of reasons why these proposals have failed across the country since frankly the early 2000s you look at including even recently in nevada we have failed there s when you look at other states that look at this they a lot of them backed away particularly after the california crisis when enron moved into california take advantage of their so called market based model which resulted any catalyst for that crisis and having some of the highest power prices in the country so i don t think it s by accident that there hasn t been a state capacity regulation since the california power crisis which occurred now nearly 20 years ago so there s a number of hurdles to answer your question they have to be clear for this proposal to go forward to be placed on a ballot we re going to be very actively engaged we re going to be educating on the true motives of the specialist groups and we re going to also spend a lot of time educating folks on the significant negative impacts that this failed idea would have on the state and on their pocketbooks michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you eric i appreciate that i have one other for either jim john or armando when you re in and this is more longer term when you re watching what s happening in california with pg a with edison international or and put california in the context of being the nation s largest renewable market and with the most aggressive renewable target how do you think this impacts the broader u s development of renewables if one of the largest markets is going to some turmoil and how do you think about that kind of longer term john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer so great question michael i think one of the first thing i d say is california have some very aggressive renewable targets and some very aggressive climate change goals the turmoil around the credit of the most important counter parties in the state this to say the least is not conducive to the continued capital investment to continue to further those goals and so i think it s from an energy policy standpoint in the state of california it s going to be very important for the state to recognize that and to recognize that there s been significant capital investment by companies from around the world to make that happen and to the extent that that investment is somehow diminished by these credit issues i think that s going to have real impact on your market going forward and i think the state understands that and it s one of the elements and things that they are grappling now is the deal with the fall out fires as well as some of the other issues that they ve been facing so the good news from a market standpoint is california was obviously the biggest market in the country 10 years ago in the renewable business it isn t anymore it s an important market but it s no longer the most important market in the country and with the cost declines in renewables nearly every state in the country is in the we have an opportunity to do business i think we have my last we have development going on in 48 states right now we don t have have operating projects in 48 states but we have development going on in 48 states so while i think it s very important for the state to address these issues from a climate change standpoint going forward i think the renewable market is going to be robust going forward because it is just gotten so big and the cost declines have expanded the market to such a dramatic fashion operator and with that we ll go now to jonathan arnold of deutsche bank jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my question john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer hey good morning jonathan jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst so a quick question on this is how i think about your you talked about managing through the situations at nep in context of growth rate so as we think about things you might do that would fall under that header you mentioned pushing to have the cash released and i guess you can drop down other assets more quickly you could let the dividend drift down in the range and still be within 12 to 15 is there anything else that i m missing and which of those kind of alternatives or would you either be planning to use or not use john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes i think i ll go first of all back to prior one of the prior questions about are there other attractive financing vehicles available one yes we think there are but two even if we have the finance additional drops to meet our financial expectations with existing debt capacity that we have we can do that we re fine and so really the way i would answer that question is that obviously we re vigorously try to put to negotiate something what the holders that would have allow us to and the doe don t forget the doe is in these projects that allow us to free up the cash we can t do that we have debt capacity plenty of debt capacity at nep energy resources is coming off the best development year in its history we have very clear visibility to grow prospects going forward and there are many levels in the vehicle so we are comfortable in our ability to manage through even a worst case scenario which would be where the cash is trapped until the final call is made on the contracts jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst ok so but john just on i think to be clear you said in some of them the cash is trap just by virtue of pg e saying they may file is that correct and i m just curious john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes not getting into the technicalities but one of the financings has a provision that basically just says if there is corporate action taken and further into the bankruptcy which are filing of the 8 k to be that that would constitute potentially constitute an event of default jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst but that s just on one of them john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer it s on the genesis financing it s on some of the other financing but the financings are small to a series of four or five projects that don t have any meaningful contribution or earnings jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst so there would would be sort of a judgment as to what would definitively constitute that not occurring presumably john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes it doesn t happen and i think it s back to business as usual armando pimentel president and chief executive officer jonathan let me just add just let me add something i mean obviously i think it s appropriate for the focus on the pg e assets and the cash flow but we still have at both nextera energy resources and nextera energy partners we still have a lot of projects that are not pg e in southern california edison projects that have significant cash flows and there are still many parties that are interested in attractive financing attractive for us and presumably for them that we re talking to and it s not necessarily about what s the risk of pg e in southern california edison it s about hey what other assets are available for us to be able to enter into those types of financing so i think while it s appropriate to have some focus on what s going on with pg e we got to remember that nextera energy resources has added we have 6 600 megawatts of origination this year which is a record year and that s twice the amount we had last year which was a record year and i got to tell you we feel at least internally very comfortable as john said that even if these pg e cash flows are tied up in these debt financings that we can meet our current expectations and one of the reasons that we feel that way is because we re talking to the market and two origination is going very well in energy resources jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst great that s helpful perspective thank you armando and then could i just add one more other thing we would with the gulf and florida acquisitions have been closed sooner i think than maybe you thought is there but you re not talking or of any accretion in 19 or just help us to understand the bump in 20 what s striving that and why nothing this year armando pimentel president and chief executive officer so jonathan obviously we got it done earlier than we thought but we also always assume we would have some cost to achieve this year to get there so we re being conservative as we always are and we feel very good about our plans at gulf and you can bet i am pushing the team very hard so get things done even faster than we ve laid out and so i m really optimistic about the future for gulf in this company and in our ability to bring real value to their customer and real value to shareholders so very excited about it we ll have more to talk about it in june but remember we don t have any cost to achieve in any of these numbers in 19 so jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst thank you very much operator duration 76 minutes call participants mark truscott director of investor relations jim robo

six long years after the african union s decision to establish an african free trade area policymakers met in kigali this march to put their signatures to the most ambitious pact in the continent s history after sitting through endless meetings and wading through hundreds of documents an initial forty four countries united to pledge their support for the continental free trade area cfta an ambitious pact which promises to create a single market for goods and services by eventually removing tariffs on 90 of goods and facilitating the free movement of business people for many african politicians the signing of the cfta represents a hard earned victory a vital shot in the arm for the forces of trade liberalisation and a firm commitment to overhauling a continent mired in red tape and protectionism for national governments just getting to this stage involved a delicate process of placating anxious neighbours navigating complex negotiations with industry and warding off domestic political pressures on a continent where pan african rhetoric often falls prey to the politics of self interest many argue that the signing of the cfta represents a genuine multilateral achievement i think it s a positive development there s no question that regional integration has been on the african trade agenda for some time so to see this agreement being signed by 44 is an indication that it s really being taken seriously and that governments recognise that intra regional trade is an important component of economic growth and the development of the continent says witney schneidman senior advisor for africa at law firm covington and a former us deputy assistant secretary of state for african affairs yet while a congratulatory round of backslapping may be in order the signing of the pact represents the beginning rather than the end of the monumental task of overhauling africa s dire trade record despite broad economic liberalisation across the continent over the last two decades reflected in improved gdp growth and a spike in personal incomes in many countries africa s trade figures have yet to catch up according to the brookings institution intra african exports in 2016 made up a paltry 18 of the continent s total exports compared to 59 and 69 for intra asian and intra european exports respectively for too many african countries trade still means exporting raw commodities to the developing world meanwhile high tariffs and decrepit infrastructure including crowded border posts and dilapidated roads perversely prevent many countries from trading successfully with their own neighbours while the cfta is the largest plan yet to tackle these challenges previous initiatives including the 27 member tripartite free trade area and a plethora of regional agreements have laid some of the groundwork if the cfta is to succeed where predecessors have stumbled it will have to get to grips with complex issues of tariff removal non tariff barriers and diverging degrees of economic development among signatory states perhaps most importantly those who have committed to the pact will have to pursue the kind of ruthless implementation that has long eluded them i see a lot more of the political buy in there s a strong engagement at the highest political level in trying to advance this agenda says dorothy tembo deputy executive director at the international trade centre and a former chief trade negotiator for zambia what will be key is how all this is translated from good intent into an operational plan of action how does this translate from the continental perspective to the national strategies their different plans actions and budgets barrier busting after stubbornly pursuing a controversial economic strategy of currency controls and import restrictions african policymakers are wearily familiar with the protectionist instincts of nigerian president muhammadu buhari yet in the run up to the kigali summit many still held out hope that the nigerian government would set aside its concerns and sign up to the cfta those hopes were quickly dashed under pressure from domestic manufacturers buhari told local media in no uncertain terms why he was submitting the proposals for further domestic consultation we will not agree to anything that will undermine local manufacturers and entrepreneurs or that may lead to nigeria becoming a dumping ground for finished goods he argued if nigeria s withdrawal put a dampener on the cfta signing ceremony the withdrawal of south africa for technical reasons again pending further consultations compounded fears that the cfta could be strangled at birth by an upsurge in protectionist sentiment among the largest economies while hope remains that both will eventually sign up some fear that their scepticism could influence signatories whose weaker economic position leaves them open to protectionism it s worth noting that this agreement is being achieved at a time of brexit at a time of trump s america first says schneidman i don t think is to be dismissed out of hand because there are losers when it comes to free trade it s important that nigeria s concerns are taken seriously and that it s engaged on these issues to ensure that negative consequences are ameliorated or addressed nowhere are states protectionist instincts likely to be stimulated more than in the upcoming cfta negotiations on tariff removal while the cfta has set itself the ambitious target of reducing tariffs on 90 of goods across the zone the differing goals of dozens of diverse economies are likely to hinder implementation income disparities in the bloc are over double that of other free trade areas and economically fragile states dependent on tariff revenue are likely to resist efforts to tamper with a major source of their income every country has its own issues about what it wants to protect or trade says dianna games chief executive of the africa at work consultancy we re not talking about uniform countries we re talking about countries with very different levels of development and economic priorities and it s always a testing thing when people are trying to hammer out these deals holding the cfta signatories together during these testing negotiations will prove a significant challenge especially as countries bid to gain carve outs for strategically important industries tembo says that cfta negotiators can alleviate these fears by looking to the example set by existing free trade areas such as comesa which she argues successfully encouraged countries to come aboard via a well defined adjustment facility for those facing revenue losses this is a matter that has come up particularly from vulnerable countries if there are measures put in place perhaps facilities to address the potential negative implications for those heavily reliant on customs revenue then the process on tariff reduction will move if there is a clear recognition of that aspect and steps taken to give a minimum level of comfort that would help to push countries to make commitments says tembo even then some analysts believe that a total removal of tariffs will only have a limited impact on overall trade figures the united nations conference on trade and development estimates that if all intra bloc tariffs fall to zero the total annual welfare gain for the continent could be just 4 6bn 0 2 of gdp although if tariff removal succeeds in stimulating investment gains could rise to as much as 16bn annually just as significant will be a concerted cfta effort to bring down non tariff barriers ntbs a catch all term embracing rules of origin product quotas labelling requirements and other export restrictions what you will see i suspect is that countries will sign the free trade agreement and then will introduce trade protectionism through the back door in other words non tariff barriers i think you will see a proliferation of non tariff barriers even as these tariff barriers come down and you ve seen that in previous trade arrangements says games even here past experience provides a workable template for future action in 2016 the overseas development institute conducted an investigation into non tariff barriers in the east african community it found that while some ntbs required much lengthier multi institutional processes to remove a quarter were simple complaints solved in less than three months by 2016 25 ntbs restricted eac trade but 104 had been removed following a concerted eac campaign launched in 2009 ntbs relating to trade facilitation and customs typically took longer to resolve at around 10 months but the process showed that systematic action to remove ntbs is possible if countries work together tembo believes that building on the pioneering work of these regional authorities will be crucial if the cfta is to make progress there will still be a lot of effort required to enhance integration efforts they ve made at the regional level there are still a lot of non tariff barriers and trade facilitation aspects and border requirements remain a challenge bringing together the developments that have been made by the eight regional groupings so far is something that will really be a challenge implementation implementation implementation there is little doubt that huge reserves of political capital will need to be expended in pursuit of the cfta s goals while existing free trade areas prove that african policymakers are fond of headline grabbing initiatives that meet with occasional success deeply entrenched problems afflicting african trade including a dearth of reliable trading infrastructure remain as pressing as ever there s a tendency in africa to move forward without getting the ground floor right building high rises on shaky foundations and i think that s what s happening here not sorting out the problems in previous trade areas and yet we are moving ahead to more ambitious projects says games individual countries that sign up should be publicly accountable for how they plan to make this work how they will make their own countries ready for the deal there should be consequences for non implementation and qualifying factors for countries to be part of big initiatives tembo argues that while the secretariat should be strengthened to enforce pledges signatories should also make the positive case for mutual adherence after a typically top down consultation process involving politicians and big business tembo believes that cfta organisers need to reach out to smaller businesses and common citizens to persuade them of the benefits of free trade that s what i m not really seeing a plan for how do you integrate the bottom of the pyramid it s good to remove tariffs and they can have a clear conversation on that but what can they do with respect to cross border trade that involves very small businesses that perhaps may not have adequate measures in place to accommodate that whether the cfta will ultimately deliver the 34 6bn boost estimated by the un s economic commission on africa remains to be seen while wary of backing that figure tembo believes that even partial implementation of the scheme will auger well for the future of african trade it s very ambitious and perhaps the targets and timeframes may not be very realistic if you take into account the realities that will come with implementation she says i ve been very closely associated with this process and i ve not seen this level of engagement the level of conversations around some of the details which gives me a lot of positivity david thomas

opportunities gasification is just another way to make syngas that can be turned into a wide variety of products including chemicals diesel fuel high end olefins polymers hydrogen and or power a key benefit of gasification is that it enables an environmentally friendly way to use lower value feedstocks we have successfully supported this market over the last few years with very large air separation units providing oxygen to customers operating their gasifiers in china and saudi arabia we have announced four large projects where air products will own and operate the gasifiers and syngas clean up and provide syngas and or related products to our customers the key is that these projects are consistent with our on site business model where we don t have any raw material or

on the midpoint of our fiscal year 19 guidance we will continue to execute our strategy and we believe we will deliver and increase our earnings per share by at least 10 per year on average over the coming years now i would like to turn the call over to mr scott crocco our executive vice president and chief financial officer to discuss the results in details scott scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much seifi now please turn to slide 12 for a summary of our q1 results as seifi said our team delivered another strong quarter with underlying volumes and pricing up across all three regions before i get into the results as a reminder we had a plant sale in china in the first quarter of last year so we will help you understand our results excluding this event also during this quarter we agreed with our customer in india to restructure our hydrogen supply agreement to exclude natural gas pass through and turn this into a tolling arrangement this change has no impact on our profits but it does reduce company sales as well as sales for our emea segment so we re showing the sales impact in the other line this change only impacted december so it will be a larger impact beginning next quarter overall reported sales of 2 2 billion were flat but we re up 9 excluding the jazan sale of equipment the prior year plant sale and the india contract language change excluding jazan and the plant sale volumes grew 5 with positive based volumes up in all three regions and the full on stream of lu an in asia sequential volumes were down 4 primarily due to customer planned maintenance outages and weaker seasonal volumes price improved in all three regions for the second consecutive quarter merchant pricing rose 3 which translated to an increase of 1 for the total company negative currency was driven by the chinese rmb the euro the india rupee and the chilean peso ebitda of nearly 800 million improved 8 and was up 12 excluding the prior year plant sale this improvement was driven by higher volumes positive pricing and equity affiliate income partially offset by higher costs and unfavorable currency ebitda margin of 35 7 was up 250 basis points compared to prior year adjusted earnings per share of 1 86 were up 4 versus prior year and up 9 excluding the prior year plant sale roce of 12 4 improved 50 basis points versus last year primarily due to higher profits please turn to slide 13 we had non gaap items this quarter that totaled 0 29 per share this included 0 10 for an asset write off for a government enforced customer plant shutdown we continue to negotiate this situation but do not anticipate additional charges we also had negative 0 19 from our revised estimates of the tax act impact our first quarter adjusted continuing operations eps as 1 86 was up 0 07 per share and up 0 15 excluding the prior year plant sale overall higher volumes increased eps by 0 13 excluding the prior year plant sale volume contributed 0 21 price and raw materials taken together increased eps by 0 05 net cost performance was unfavorable 0 06 as productivity in asia was offset by higher costs in americas additionally and as we have said in the past we continue to see costs associated with our investment in capabilities in our business development engineering project execution and technology areas to drive growth in the future currency and foreign exchange was 0 04 unfavorable primarily due to the chinese rmb and the euro equity affiliate income added 0 03 primarily due to new plants and operational strength in mexico the overall tax rate was a 0 03 headwind versus last year consistent with our expectations we expect the fy 19 tax rate to be in the range of 19 to 20 finally we had other items that combined for a negative 0 01 including higher non operating income offset by higher interest expense now please turn to slide 14 we continue to generate strong cash flow during the last 12 months we generated almost 11 per share or 2 3 billion of distributable cash flow nearly 100 million higher than fiscal year 2018 the 2 3 billion of distributable cash flow allowed us to pay over 900 million or about 40 as dividends and still have over 1 4 billion available for high return investments in our core industrial gas business this strong cash flow enables us to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment slide no 15 shows our capital deployment progress and is an update of the information we introduced last quarter since the start of fy 2018 we have spent about 1 8 billion on m a and growth projects excluding maintenance capital in addition we have committed but not yet spent almost 6 5 billion on projects and m a we continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted aa2 rating if we maintain this rating at a debt level of about at a debt level of about three times the last 12 months ebitda we have over 8 5 billion available to invest today and based on our last 12 months investable cash flow we expect to have almost 5 5 billion over the remaining there and three quarter years therefore in total we have about 14 billion remaining to invest the almost 2 billion we have spent so far and the 14 billion available gives us a total of almost 16 billion of total available capacity for fy 2018 through fy 2022 so you can see we have spent over 10 and committed over half of our total available capacity now to begin the review of our business segment results i ll turn the call back over to seifi seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you scott please turn to slide 16 asia where we continue to deliver strong sales and profit growth i was just in asia last week and remain very excited about our growth opportunities we have an excellent and committed team running our business in asia at this point we have not seen any meaningful impact on our business or projects as a result of any trade issues between the united states and china it will be interesting however to see how the lunar new year holiday impacts the economy this coming quarter we remain focused on our business in china and very positive on our long term growth prospects in china sales were cheapest and lower than last year with 2 lower volume and 3 unfavorable currency partially offset by better pricing and higher energy pass through excluding the impact of plant sale last year that scott mentioned sales were up 16 again excluding the impact of plant sale last year volumes were up 17 with new projects primarily lu an driving about 10 of the increase while the base business and the small acquisitions accounted for the rest overall for the region overall pricing for the region was up 1 versus last year the seventh consecutive quarter of year on year price improvement the merchant business pricing was up 3 with positive pricing across all subregions in asia the strong volumes and pricing plus favorable productivity increased both profits and margins ebitda increased by over 20 and ebitda margin improved 920 basis points excluding prior year plants sale ebitda was up more than 30 and margins were up 470 basis points sequentially profits and margins increased due to productivity and the full running rate from lu an now i would like to turn the call back over to scott to discuss our american results scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you seifi please turn to slide 17 for a review of our americas results for the quarter sales grew 9 with both volume and price up 2 higher energy pass through added 7 more than offsetting a negative 2 currency effect volumes from new plants and north america based merchant were both positive and overcame weaker latin america volumes and customer planned maintenance outages negatively impacting hydrogen volumes overall this is the eighth consecutive quarter of volume improvement for the region the impact of our pricing actions is also gaining momentum as price was up 2 the best result in three years merchant pricing was up 4 americas ebitda increased 4 as improved volume and price as well as higher equity affiliate income due to better results in mexico were partially offset by increased costs while the team remains focused on driving productivity we continue to see higher transportation and maintenance costs ebitda margin excluding the impact of energy pass through was up 50 basis points sequentially planned customer maintenance outages negatively impacted both hydrogen volumes and maintenance costs excluding the impact of energy pass through sequential ebitda margin was down 130 basis points now i would like to turn the call back over to simon to discuss our other segments simon simon moore vice president of investor relations thank you scott please turn to slide 18 for a review of our emea results sales were up 2 primarily driven by 1 better volumes and 2 higher price 6 higher energy pass through was offset by unfavorable currency and the contract modification in india as scott mentioned this change to a tolling agreement reduces sales and volumes but has no profit impact price and volume were both up for the quarter as we continued to see solid demand in the merchant market and positive results from our pricing actions merchant price grew 4 for the quarter we did not see any negative impacts associated with the brexit uncertainty during this quarter ebitda was nearly flat as positive volume and price were offset primarily by negative currency ebitda margin was 31 6 down 70 basis points excluding the impact of higher energy pass through ebitda margin was up 80 basis points primarily due to the india plant contract change sequentially volumes were down on seasonality price was slightly positive but rounded to flat the ebitda decrease was primarily due to currency and a reduction in equity affiliate income following a seasonally strong fourth quarter in our italy joint venture now please turn to slide 19 for a brief comment on our global gases segment which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs sales and ebitda declined due to lower project activity as we approach the conclusion of the jazan asu sale of equipment project we continue to expect the jazan asu project on stream in phases in fiscal 2019 and as previously communicated we expect the jazan asu overall to be a headwind for fy 19 versus fy 18 now please turn to slide 20 for a brief comment on our corporate segment which includes our lng business our helium container business and our corporate costs sales and profits were about flat compared to prior year with no significant change in the lng business we continue to be optimistic about future prospects for the lng business but have not yet seen the industry optimism translate into firm orders now i m pleased to turn the call back over to seifi for a discussion of our outlook seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you simon as you all know very well we are living in a very uncertain world today air products can t predict or control worldwide political or economic developments but we do have control over our operational performance and our growth investments and we are confident we will continue to deliver on the commitments we have made despite the world events we have not seen any material impact on air products at this point from these global uncertainties as demonstrated by our results in the first quarter our team around the world continues to be very excited about air products future our five point strategic plan provides the framework to drive our success going forward and our safety productivity and operating performance continue to provide the foundation for our continued growth we have the financial capacity the opportunities and the team to successfully win key growth projects now please turn to slide no 21 we are all working hard every day to be the safest most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world providing excellent service to our customers despite increased economic and political uncertainty our guidance for the fiscal year 2019 remains unchanged and is in a range of 8 05 to 8 30 per share and despite currency headwinds at midpoint our guidance represents 10 growth over our very strong fiscal year 2018 performance for quarter two of fiscal year 2019 our earnings per share guidance is 1 80 to 1 90 at midpoint up 8 over last year we continue to expect our capital expenditure to be in the range of 2 3 billion to 2 5 billion for fiscal year 2019 and finally please turn to slide no 22 as always our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at air products this is what allows us to continue to generate our superior safety and operational performance i want to thank all of our 16 000 people around the world for their total commitment and hard work and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of working together now we are delighted to answer your questions questions and answers operator thank you and we ll first hear from don carson of susquehanna don carson susquehanna financial group analyst thank you good morning seifi seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning don how are you doing don carson susquehanna financial group analyst very well thank you you commented that you can t control economic events obviously but could you sort of do a walk around the world just in terms of what you re seeing in your base business given that we re hearing that in many regions industrial production is slowing seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer sure i start from asia we continue to see very good growth in countries like korea taiwan malaysia indonesia all of those countries india out of those countries with respect to china we i have not seen any slowdown yet the only thing that concerns us and we are keeping an eye on it is how is the lunar new year in china play out that means that our people going to take longer shutdowns because of the way that the chinese new year is kind of situated calendar wise that people would take longer weekends or longer that is the only thing that we are watching and quite frankly that is one of the reasons that contrary to our usual practice we have given you a guidance of 0 10 rather than 0 05 a spread for this quarter so that is as i said we have not seen any significant slowdown in our business in china but the lunar new year and how it plays can have an effect and that is why you can say that we are conservative in our guidance for the quarter the rest of asia is doing very well as i said when we come in europe europe is flat again the concern that we have is all of the turmoil with respect to brexit what would be the effect in the next few months on the pound exchange rate and also the business in our business in united kingdom as you know we have a big business there so that is again another reason why we were conservative in our estimates for the second quarter in the united states things have not changed since we have talked last time there is a slowdown of industrial production but we do not see any material impact on our results and that is why we are not changing our overall estimate for the year we do expect a stronger second half than the first half because of some of the projects and pricing actions that we have taken and that is why we remain very confident about the guidance that we have given for the year in addition i also have to add that things remain very very negative in latin america but that s not a big part of our business don carson susquehanna financial group analyst ok and then a quick follow up i noticed on slide 13 your price cost gap narrowed considerably it was only a 0 01 negative delta versus 0 14 last quarter so how are you able to narrow that delta specifically on the cost side where it was only a 0 06 drag this quarter versus 0 16 last quarter seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well as you recall in the last call i was very transparent about my dissatisfaction with our cost performance so obviously everybody took that to heart and we have worked very hard on productivity to improve our cost position and we hope to see that number improving as we go forward so we have taken action don don carson susquehanna financial group analyst all right thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator and next we ll hear from christopher parkinson of credit suisse christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you given the circumstances your result in asia was pretty solid can you just parse out the key volume drivers outside of lu an as well as your intermediate term expectations post the new year just that and any quick views on the merchant market operates etc would be helpful thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning chris sure obviously lu an was about 10 of the growth but the rest of the growth we are reporting asia results the rest of the growth is coming from as i said china despite what everybody said a slowdown a slowdown but they are growing at 6 6 so we see the benefit of that in our merchant business but in addition as i said countries like korea taiwan indonesia malaysia they are doing very well and they contributed to our positive results scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer maybe if i could just add also that this is also an area that we saw good cost improvement as seifi mentioned earlier nice cost performance in the quarter too christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you that s helpful perfect and then also you mentioned plant refinery outages in north america affecting results but this was also a theme last year regarding the year on year comp can you just comment if the planned downtime was in line with your initial expectations and then also just what are your updated views on hydrogen demands intermediate to long term in the u s globally etc thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer sure first of all the plant outages are totally in line with expectations as we grow our business and we have more and more hydrogen plants obviously to turn around there are more turnarounds but there is nothing out of line they are all in accordance with our expectation there is nothing unexpected has happened with respect to hydrogen demand obviously a significant driver for our hydrogen demand in the u s is how many miles people drive and the gasoline demand but that continuous to remain stable as for the future as you know we have announced two new hydrogen plants that we are going to build liquid hydrogen plants we see significant growth opportunities for liquid hydrogen and in terms of the so called gaseous hydrogen there are projects being discussed in the united states in the gulf coast and other areas that would require significant amounts of hydrogen for the production of chemicals and we will obviously participate on that so overall we remain very positive christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you very much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator next we ll hear from robert schwartz of goldman sachs robert schwartz goldman sachs analyst thanks very much good morning seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning bob how are you doing robert schwartz goldman sachs analyst i m doing well thank you it strikes me that over the last couple of years you ve moved toward maybe lifting or improving the stability of the organization by some of the divestitures you ve made and then enhancing some of these large gasification projects and yet your multiple continues to go in the wrong direction so i m wondering can you help frame through your competitive advantage and what it means to have such a significant on site presence and sort of how you see that developing and what it means to the volatility of your business seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well bob first of all thank you for your comment we definitely have moved in the direction of stabilizing the business getting the company focused on the right business and significantly enhancing our on site presence because that is a much more stable business and we have changed our business model to get into syngas production where we see significant opportunity we do have a lot of cash on hand we have a very strong balance sheet and with the acquisition of the technologies from shell and ge and others we are in a very strong position to be the leader in gasification and there are many many many many opportunities as for why our multiple i m not selling air product stock i mean my job is to articulate our strategy and tell our investors what we are doing and then they will decide the multiples i think the market is underestimating our ability to deploy the cash and i also understand that there is a lot of concern about gasification it s a new area there was a lot of concern when we announced lu an about what is this do you know how to run gasifiers and all of that i m hoping that as we go forward we demonstrate that we can run these facilities and as we sign more large deals which will significantly strengthen our portfolio that the investors will give us due consideration in time as i said my job is not to argue about the multiple my job is to explain and articulate out a strategy and i think in time the investors will see where we are as compared to our competitors robert schwartz goldman sachs analyst i appreciate that can i ask you very briefly on the shell technology you guys have mentioned applying that maybe to help solve some of the high sulfur resid streams as companies try to adhere to the i o 2020 standards and 2020 is pretty close is that something that looks like there s some development there or is it getting pushed out is this a meaningful opportunity or just something maybe on the periphery for that business seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer bob it is a meaningful opportunity the best example of that is the 8 billion project that we are doing in saudi arabia that is all about taking the bottom of the refinery and gasifying it and upgrading it because they wouldn t be able to sell that to the market for fueling the ships so that is the message this opportunity is great there is a great opportunity the issue is that a lot of people are not taking action because they are hoping that the implementation of i o 20 will be delayed and as i m sure you know there is a lot of lobbying going on by some of the industry in the united states to do that but in the long term that is going to be a significant opportunity yes robert schwartz goldman sachs analyst great thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you sir operator and next we ll hear from jeffrey zekauskas of j p morgan jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst thanks very much good morning seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning jeff how are you doing jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst good in the different slides you spoke about merchant pricing being up 3 in the americas 3 in asia 4 in emea but the actual price in the slides for each of the geographic segments is lower it s 2 in the americas 1 in asia and 2 in europe what accounts for the difference what s pushing down that price level and in the overall slide that describes price it seems that costs are going up faster than price is that the right comparison or is there a real price benefit and the costs are more internal or having to do with turnarounds or something like that seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer yes i ll have scott answer the question that you had asked but on the cost side the cost side is related to increasing our capabilities but i like scott to answer your first question go ahead scott scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning jeff thanks for the question so one of the things that we ve introduced in the last quarter or so is a we refer to it as a merchant on merchant price increase and price change so as you know air products has a large percentage of our portfolio 50 in on sites so when we go through the slides we ll do price over the entire business which two thirds or so in the u s is tonnage so we felt the 1 for ap and the 1 for asia and then 2 for americas and 2 for emea that s over the total portfolio of those businesses what we thought would be helpful is to also additionally provide you with a merchant on merchant that looks at the price change in this case increase total air products 3 asia 3 4 and 4 for americas emea price increase on the merchant business so it provides you a little bit more insight as to what s going on on that portion of the business as opposed to spread across the entire company hopefully i was clear on that seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer is that clear jeff jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst yes that s clear and then for my follow up is it the case that your pension costs this year will drop about 65 million from 90 million to 25 million or so and when i looked at your income statement the non controlling interest was 9 5 million i think versus 6 9 million last year and i would have thought the non controlling interest number would have been larger given that lu an is now on stream and is quite profitable is there something eccentric in non controlling interest number and what about seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer jeff scott can address those things we have talked about that he has all of the regions scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer sure hi this is scott so first on pension well you expect to have a little bit of a drop this year versus last year on pension maybe for the year total pension expense and let me put it that way maybe it s like 30 or so from an expense perspective and by the way no jeff you re always interested in the cash flow statement our contributions for the pension should be in the same line so we think non cash expense versus contribution on the pensions to be about a wash and call it 30 and change then in terms of non controlling interest you are right lu an was the biggest part of it recognizing that we had i think it was in the third quarter of last year we had a pure air adjustment that was a little bit of an anomaly because of the way that that arrangement was canceled but i think going forward we would expect to see by the way we also have a venture with a minority position over in asia as well so that s going to move around the non controlling interest but the biggest item in there is going to be lu an going forward jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst was pension expense 90 million last year scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer give me a second including a bunch of the non gaap stuff that we had in there i think it was up about that level now i ll keep my comments here around kind of the ongoing underlying to be was a little bit lower than that and all in was something in that order jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst ok great thank you so much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you jeff operator next we ll hear from vincent andrews of morgan stanley vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you and good morning everyone if i could just ask on the price cost equation as was mentioned before you re down to sort of a negative 0 01 in the fiscal first quarter should we anticipate as we move through the balance of the year that price is going to exceed cost inflation or is it going to stay kind of the way things are seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer that is our goal vincent vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst you think you re going to achieve it seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer we always want to see a price increase and a cost increase that is our goal yes vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst ok and if i could ask you on the dividend and i ll preface this by noting that you have almost a 3 yield in your dividend aristocrat but the increase this year was a lot less than the last couple of years and it s less than sort of the eps growth that you re anticipating so i m just wondering if there s any particular reason the dividend increase wasn t larger seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer yes we had promised the investors and we keep our promise that our dividend will the 2 5 to 3 of the stock price and we right now increased the dividend to be at around 3 so if next quarter the stock price goes up significantly which obviously we hope so then we will increase the dividend vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst ok thank you very much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer now that is the guiding principle vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst ok that s very helpful thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator steve byrne of bank of america steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes thank you is it reasonable to assume that the incremental ebitda margin on lu an is well above 50 and would it have been even better if you had built the gasifier rather than buying it seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well steve how do you want me to answer that question without giving a lot of information to our competitors which is not necessary obviously you are very right that ebitda margin on that business is over 50 actually a lot better than 50 yes steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst and seifi what drives the attractiveness of the gasifier that you have the intellectual property that gives you an edge seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer yes absolutely the fact that we own the technology we have inherited the people who know what the hell they are doing and we were able to take over those gasifiers and run them very efficiently and more efficiently than they would otherwise run and that is why the profitability is higher because we are creating value for our partners because we are running that plant very efficiently and obviously as a result we are seeing the good results yes owning the shell technology is by far the biggest competitive advantage that we have and also the ge technology that is putting us in two advantages no 1 we know what we are doing but no 2 owning these technologies is giving us visibility to projects way before everybody knows about it because if somebody is thinking about a project 10 years from now the first thing they do as you know in the field of study and all of that they select a technology therefore they talk to us there before they even have a project or announce a project or issue a request for quotation so we end up having a three four or five year head start on our competitors steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst and this plant that was a forced shutdown in china by the government should we assume that was an older plant that didn t have a take or pay contract seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer that plant that was shut down has nothing to do with gasification as you know it s a seed plant it s a plant that we have been supplying oxygen to since 2005 that plant was in the middle of a city so it is not a surprise that in time the city grows and therefore that plant either has to move or gets shut down so right now that plant has been shut down we did have a take or pay contract on that but the take or pay contract obviously at the end of the day if the plant is shut down it s force majeure and you have to deal with that but that s not a material part of our business and in the future do we have other plants who are in the middle of cities that might be shut down smaller plants that can happen too so it s not a big surprise steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer sure operator next we ll hear from kevin mccarthy of vertical research partners kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning seifi you indicated that you are very confident in your ability to deploy capital into high return projects can you elaborate on that is it the case that you ve got such a target rich environment that even if macro economics don t cooperate you ve got plenty to choose from on the menu and then second can you give us an update on the yankuang gasification project and what the timing of that looks like these days seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well good morning kevin thank you very much for your good questions no 1 with respect to opportunities the opportunities that we are working on these gasification projects they are not driven by the economy they are driven by the strategic decision by countries like china india indonesia uzbekistan and all of these other places to become independent of oil they had the cold resources and they want to convert that to chemicals so as a result the reason i m very confident is because currently we are working on more than 52 of these projects so if they all materialize it would require 70 billion of investments so we have positioned ourselves properly we have chosen the technology we have the people and we are well positioned and we have the cash to invest and therefore that is what makes me confident and whatever happens to the economy i think these countries will need to do these projects in order to become independent strategically from oil so with respect to the yankuang project that project is a huge project it s about a 12 billion project and we are working on that with yankuang in trying to develop that there are obviously environmental issues investment issues and all of that and we expect that project to be on a stream somewhere around 2022 and we will give you an update as we go forward kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst ok and secondly if i may can you talk about the modification of your contract in india i imagine if you re moving to a tolling arrangement we should expect your sales to decline and your margins to rise so that there s no net profit impact to your emea segment i guess a is that correct and b if possible maybe you can comment on some of those effects in terms of magnitude seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well first of all you are analyzing it absolutely correctly when it becomes a tolling thing then the price of natural gas is not put into our sales and therefore it will reduce our sales but improve our margin with no effect on the bottom line the reason that that has happened is that our partner in india had found a way that if they do it that way it is beneficial to them from a tax point of view and obviously from our point of view we still get the same dfc it doesn t change but in terms of the optics for the results you are right it decreases sales and increases the margins that ok kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes thank you so much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator pj juvekar of citi has our next question pj juvekar citi analyst yes hi good morning seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning pj how are you pj juvekar citi analyst good so seifi you got good merchant on merchant pricing can you just review merchant utilization rates around the world i think last year you had mentioned that china utilization was close to 90 is that still the case and this good pricing that you saw which end markets or which industries were you able to raise prices to seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer pj first of all if i may just go around the world china if you take all of china the utilization rate is only about 56 57 but china is a very big country there are pockets in china where our utilization is about 90 92 and that is what is giving us the pricing power utilization rates in europe are still at around 75 76 and the same thing is in the united states but again even in europe or in the u s there are pockets as you know industrial gases the merchant business is very very local so we can have a lot of capacity in california but no capacity in pennsylvania so we obviously analyze these things in detail and take action as appropriate with respect to the end markets there is no specific end market that is driving this it is just the utilization of the plant in the specific geography that you are located pj juvekar citi analyst ok thank you and then secondly seifi you haven t been buying back stock and i know the preference is to invest in high return projects but why not buy back some stock which gives you flexibility to take advantage of any market dislocation seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer we are not buying stock and we don t plan to buy stock because we think if you do the math that you can do better than i do if you have projects like lu an to invest the return for the investors is a lot higher than us going and wasting that cash on giving money to a bunch of people who are going to go away and will not be a longer term shareholder so it is a very economic decision i think people who buy stock are people who have run out of steam in terms of growth and therefore the only way that they can make shareholders happy is to announce stock buyback programs we have the opportunity to invest our money in projects that in the long term will generate and have a lot more value for our shareholders than buying back stock and as you know i m a big shareholder and i m very passionate about this because i want to make more money in the long term not to get cash this afternoon and then disappear pj juvekar citi analyst very interesting thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator next we ll hear from duffy fischer of barclays duffy fischer barclays analyst yes good morning fellows question just on the wind now that it s up and running for three months how is it running no 1 what lessons learned have you had from that and then second one is just have you closed the ge deal yet seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer for your first question i don t want to jinx ourselves so i m going to be knocking on wood a little bit the lu an project operation is going very well all four gasifiers are running at capacity our customer has the need for the product their business is doing very well they are taking all of the syngas and converting it to chemicals and selling it and making money so up to now it has been very positive i am very very very proud of our team down there we have something like 400 people working on this gasifier and running it every day and we have as i have always been telling investors we know how to run process plants if we run a hydrogen plant we should be able to run a gasifier but i have to say that the acquisition of the shell technology and having those people on our team has significantly helped us to be able to do that so from that point of view we are doing very well scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer ge have we closed ge seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer yes with respect to the ge we have closed the ge yes and we are in the process of duffy fischer barclays analyst ok great seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer yeah thank you very much duffy fischer barclays analyst yes thank you guys seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator next we ll here from jim sheehan of suntrust jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you good morning what is your outlook for the lng business in the second half of the year please seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well jim as you know our lng business is the kind of business that you either get a big contract or you don t get a big contract so i don t want to make too much of a prediction here but the signs are positive that means that it is possible that we would be awarded some additional contracts and that is one of the reasons that maybe we are a little bit more optimistic about confirming our results but these things are not done until they are done there are a lot of projects on the drawing board as you know and if anything happens we will obviously make an appropriate announcement but i have to say that i m more optimistic today than i was six months ago jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst great and in your full year guidance what are you guys assuming for the corporate segment please seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer in terms of what jim jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yes in terms of your incremental change from fiscal 2018 to 2019 just trying to get some color on how to model the corporate segment seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well i think that the corporate segment in terms of the cost of running the company on a day to day basis our finance department legal department it department and all of that you know how we operate you shouldn t expect much of a change there i mean that is going to be a steady with no significant increases as far as any kind of plant sale that we might have that would show up in that sector for our lng business and all of that i think for your model assume flat and then anything that happens would be good news jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you seifi seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from john roberts of ubs john roberts ubs analyst thank you scott for the 6 3 billion in commitments on page 15 or the approximate 7 billion on page 21 whichever one you want could you remind us roughly of the pace at which the cash will go out the door against the commitment scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer hi john good morning it s going to be coming in different methods so to speak right if it s an asset buyback then that is going to come in a big check if it s an organic project these are large particularly the gasification projects the spending with curve can be three four years and so it will be lumpy so to speak driven by the nature of the project itself whether it s an asset purchase or an organic seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer but as a rule of thumb i think you should assume this year we are saying we will spend about 2 5 billion i think you should assume that in the next two years that number will go to about 3 5 billion every year john roberts ubs analyst thank you that s helpful and then on slide 13 the 0 06 unfavorable cost scott talked about a lot of things like technology engineering business development is that primarily in the americas gases segment or is a significant part of that over in global gases as well seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer it is cost increases as related to when we buy shell technology when we buy that technology ge we get a lot of people we are pursuing as i told you more than 50 gasification projects so that s another almost 100 people that you have to put in there in order to develop these projects those are the costs in terms of the section where you see that scott scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer a lot of that will be in corporate and spread around depending on the nature of these costs that we re building our capability but john the other item is the maintenance the planned customers outages so that s in that number as well and that s largely an america s comment with the planned turns john roberts ubs analyst ok thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer ok thank you operator next we ll hear from john mcnulty of bmo capital markets john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yeah good morning thanks for taking my question seifi you highlight a big backlog or at least potential backlog on gasification projects and i know in the past you ve targeted 10 returns on capital as you become more evidently the kind of partner of choice you ve got greater experience doing this you ve built up the technology do you see risk to the upside in terms of how to think about the returns on capital for future projects and how should we be thinking about that seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well john we have said that our minimum requirement is 10 but if we can t get a project at 25 we will do that so i think your analysis is exactly correct that as we become the partner of choice we should be able to command a higher price and obviously the other dynamic is that if our competitors are announcing 6 billion share buyback then i assume they don t have the money to compete in this project which would put us in a better position john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the color seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator david begleiter of deutsche bank david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning david how are you david begleiter deutsche bank analyst well thank you seifi we just saw in the merchant price in the americas the plus 4 are you seeing competitor support for the pricing and has there been any impact from the linde merger on pricing dynamics in the industry seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well first of all the linde merger is not closed david as you know so there is certainly no impact from that but as you know in general competitors pricing and so on i have my lawyer looking at me and saying don t say anything considering the nature of the industry so i apologize for not being able to comment on that i shouldn t comment on that david begleiter deutsche bank analyst understood and just on the guidance for the year seifi what do you need to do or see happen to get to the upper half of the guidance range for this year seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer i think what would help us is lunar new year shut down in china which is normal rather than being longer a stabilization of the discussions on brexit and making sure that our business in uk doesn t suffer and a better hopefully a few orders for the lng that would help too david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you very much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator next we ll hear from mike sison of keybanc mike sison keybanc capital markets hey guys nice quarter seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much mike mike sison keybanc capital markets seifi you had mentioned that you feel confident air products can continue to grow at 10 annually for some time and you ve talked positively about gasification is there a way to help us understand what of that 10 how much gasification can support in terms of growth over the next couple of years seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well if all of the projects that we are talking gasification actually materialize and we deploy the capital that we are talking about we will grow a lot better than 10 if we look at the conventional industrial gas business worldwide and consider that that business will grow with the gdp worldwide therefore you can expect much more than 3 to 4 growth every year so when we say 10 we expect at least 6 from gasification and larger projects but as i said if we can actually implement and deploy the capital and have 10 more projects like lu an then we will grow a lot better than 10 mike sison keybanc capital markets got it and then as a quick follow up if you had your choice which you probably do and you think about the capital deployment is it preferable to spend all the capital on gasification versus historical asus and maybe talk about that concept going forward seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well i m glad you asked the question we remain totally committed to our core business we are going to invest as much as we possibly can in our merchant business in our standard gas generators our hydrogen business and all of that so the gasification is not taking anything away from that we will be as aggressive and as enthusiastic in investing in our core business gasification is on top of that but gasification is not going to take away from our focus on our normal business we are not going to concede any market share anywhere in the world in our business our helium business our hydrogen business and we will invest in those businesses as appropriate all we are saying is that those businesses fundamentally are not going to grow much better than gdp and therefore you need to have another vehicle in order to meet our ambitious goal of delivering more than 10 and we have found that vehicle to be gasification and very large projects mike sison keybanc capital markets got it thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much operator next we ll hear from mike harrison of seaport global securities mike harrison seaport global securites analyst hi good morning seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning mike how are you doing mike harrison seaport global securites analyst doing well thank you seifi we ve talked a little bit about the merchant business and you ve talked a little bit about utilization i was wondering if you can talk about your approach to merchant capacity in north america we ve seen you announce some merchant asu in ohio new york minnesota any details on which end markets or customer dynamics are driving the need for more capacity and what kind of utilization rates would you expect on those plants once they get up and running seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well mike that s a very good cause we remain committed as we have always been to make sure that our customers have access to competitive products so the way we approach this thing is that i mean this is our business every day when we look at an area and we see that we are operating at 90 and the market is growing we obviously go on the mission plan in order to make sure we can supply the market and then when we see an area like in minnesota where there is really very few competitors competing in there and the market is growing then it is appropriate for us to go and build a plan so our approach is focused on meeting the demands of our customers and making sure they have access to products mike harrison seaport global securites analyst all right and then was also hoping to get an update on the helium market i know that you recently announced an agreement with sonatrach in algeria any comments on the growth or pricing dynamics you re seeing in helium seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer helium is obviously a very rare commodity there are not that many places where you can produce it and we are the largest helium producer in the world so we are very committed again to meet the demands of our customers and therefore we develop helium opportunities anywhere in the world that we can possibly do we have been operating in algeria for many years and we saw an opportunity to be able to expand on our operation there and to make helium available to our customers we are very proud that right now as we speak we are the only helium producer in the world who has not declared force majeure i think we are very committed in that we always make sure that we have supply for our customers so the helium business is growing there is significant amount of rocket launches that require helium there s significant amount of growth in medical use for mri machines and all of that and air products as the leader of the helium business worldwide is committed to make sure that we have product for our customers mike harrison seaport global securites analyst all right thanks very much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator laurence alexander of jefferies has our next question laurence alexander jefferies analyst good morning just a quick one can you give a sense for how much your backlog has gone up excluding the gasification projects given the number of announcements that were made during the quarter seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer during the quarter it hasn t gone up that much because we haven t announced too many projects but overall the backlog for our standard business is somewhere in the order of about 1 5 billion and that hasn t changed significantly laurence alexander jefferies analyst ok and for the commitments on the gasification side are those at this point basically fixed or will you have some wiggle room in terms of project financing and other ways to maybe reduce the capital investment or the capital outlay by our products for the states seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer we look at that issue on a project by project basis in terms of where it is and all of that so as you know when we announced the big project in saudi arabia we said that that project is going to be order of magnitude more than 8 billion and on that front we are going to use 40 equity and 60 project financing so it s very much driven by the specific project and the nature of the project but then it comes to a project like jiutai in china where the capital requirement is 700 million we do that 100 corporate finance it s very project driven laurence alexander jefferies analyst thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you we have time for another question we have significantly run over time so can we have one other question please operator absolutely our final question for today will come from jonas oxgaard of bernstein jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst morning guys seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer hi how are you jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst oh living the dream everyday seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer that s great that s great that s a good positive attitude jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst thank you so to go from that positive attitude to a less positive question perhaps if we can return to that plant in china that you closed down and take or pay was voided by a force majeure in the past when you talked about the gasification plants and the potential risk of china closing down gasification because of coal usage the answer has always been the take or pays are there to protect us so was there something unique about this particular one or how should i think about this in the grander context seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer i think you shouldn t the two are not comparable i mean the reason that the plant that guang plant was shut down was because it was in the middle of the city the city is growing and obviously the sil plant is an plant and it is not equipped with all of the latest technology and they didn t have the money to do that so the government shut them down the gasification plants that we are building are not in populated areas they are significant projects which are related to significant 10 billion 12 billion investments for chemical production and the possibility of those things being shut down for they are actually being built because they are environmentally friendly so there is really kind of no comparison between the two jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst ok but if they were to be shut down then the take or pays would be voided seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well my friend it s just like saying that if there is war in venezuela they come and take over your plants like it has happened to exxon before so those are the kind of things that force majeure works both ways because we want to be protected that in case the government we have a plant supplying a sil plant and something goes wrong with our plan and they come and say you can t operate we can t be liable to the customer to kind of supply them oxygen because we are under a force majeure situation or when an air compressor blows up in a plant which we have had situations like that we declare force majeure so that we don t get sued by the customer for not supplying them oxygen to run their or hydrogen to run their refinery so that works both ways that s kind of a standard in the contract jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst ok thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you ok with that i would like to thank everybody for being on the call thanks for taking time from your very busy schedule and we appreciate your interest in our company thank you for the very good questions that allows us to kind of articulate our results and we look forward to talking to you next quarter with hopefully better results thank you very much operator duration 79 minutes call participants simon moore vice president of investor

our debt balance to maintain our current targeted aa2 rating at this rating we believe we still have about 14 billion remaining to invest so we have already spent or committed over half of the 16 billion available over the five year period of fiscal year 18 to fiscal year 22 we recently announced new projects in california minnesota india algeria and china we have made great progress so far

slide no 8 you can see our gasification strategy that continues to be a key focus of our investment opportunities gasification is just another way to make syngas that can be turned into a wide variety of products including chemicals diesel fuel high end olefins polymers hydrogen and or power a key benefit of gasification is that it enables an environmentally friendly way to use lower value feedstocks we have successfully supported this market over the last few years with very large air separation units providing oxygen to customers operating their gasifiers in china and saudi arabia we have announced four large projects where air products will own and operate the gasifiers and syngas clean up and provide syngas and or related products to our customers the key is that these projects are consistent with our on site business model where we don t have any raw material or product volume or price risk the lu an project that we had announced before is fully on a stream thanks to the continued effort of our great team in china and continuous to successfully supply syngas to lu an for their chemical production you see the positive impact of lu an in our asia and company results this quarter and we remain confident lu an will deliver over 0 25 of earnings per share in fiscal year 19 and we continue to make good progress on the other gasification projects we have announced now please turn to slide no 9 we remain committed to our goal of being the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three metrics and we are now please go to slide n0 10 which is always my favorite slide showing the over 1 000 basis point improvement in our ebitda margin finally please turn to slide no 11 the successful execution of our strategy will allow us to deliver 13 compounded annual earnings per share growth over the last five years based on the midpoint of our fiscal year 19 guidance we will continue to execute our strategy and we believe we will deliver and increase our earnings per share by at least 10 per year on average over the coming years now i would like to turn the call over to mr scott crocco our executive vice president and chief financial officer to discuss the results in details scott scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much seifi now please turn to slide 12 for a summary of our q1 results as seifi said our team delivered another strong quarter with underlying volumes and pricing up across all three regions before i get into the results as a reminder we had a plant sale in china in the first quarter of last year so we will help you understand our results excluding this event also during this quarter we agreed with our customer in india to restructure our hydrogen supply agreement to exclude natural gas pass through and turn this into a tolling arrangement this change has no impact on our profits but it does reduce company sales as well as sales for our emea segment so we re showing the sales impact in the other line this change only impacted december so it will be a larger impact beginning next quarter overall reported sales of 2 2 billion were flat but we re up 9 excluding the jazan sale of equipment the prior year plant sale and the india contract language change excluding jazan and the plant sale volumes grew 5 with positive based volumes up in all three regions and the full on stream of lu an in asia sequential volumes were down 4 primarily due to customer planned maintenance outages and weaker seasonal volumes price improved in all three regions for the second consecutive quarter merchant pricing rose 3 which translated to an increase of 1 for the total company negative currency was driven by the chinese rmb the euro the india rupee and the chilean peso ebitda of nearly 800 million improved 8 and was up 12 excluding the prior year plant sale this improvement was driven by higher volumes positive pricing and equity affiliate income partially offset by higher costs and unfavorable currency ebitda margin of 35 7 was up 250 basis points compared to prior year adjusted earnings per share of 1 86 were up 4 versus prior year and up 9 excluding the prior year plant sale roce of 12 4 improved 50 basis points versus last year primarily due to higher profits please turn to slide 13 we had non gaap items this quarter that totaled 0 29 per share this included 0 10 for an asset write off for a government enforced customer plant shutdown we continue to negotiate this situation but do not anticipate additional charges we also had negative 0 19 from our revised estimates of the tax act impact our first quarter adjusted continuing operations eps as 1 86 was up 0 07 per share and up 0 15 excluding the prior year plant sale overall higher volumes increased eps by 0 13 excluding the prior year plant sale volume contributed 0 21 price and raw materials taken together increased eps by 0 05 net cost performance was unfavorable 0 06 as productivity in asia was offset by higher costs in americas additionally and as we have said in the past we continue to see costs associated with our investment in capabilities in our business development engineering project execution and technology areas to drive growth in the future currency and foreign exchange was 0 04 unfavorable primarily due to the chinese rmb and the euro equity affiliate income added 0 03 primarily due to new plants and operational strength in mexico the overall tax rate was a 0 03 headwind versus last year consistent with our expectations we expect the fy 19 tax rate to be in the range of 19 to 20 finally we had other items that combined for a negative 0 01 including higher non operating income offset by higher interest expense now please turn to slide 14 we continue to generate strong cash flow during the last 12 months we generated almost 11 per share or 2 3 billion of distributable cash flow nearly 100 million higher than fiscal year 2018 the 2 3 billion of distributable cash flow allowed us to pay over 900 million or about 40 as dividends and still have over 1 4 billion available for high return investments in our core industrial gas business this strong cash flow enables us to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment slide no 15 shows our capital deployment progress and is an update of the information we introduced last quarter since the start of fy 2018 we have spent about 1 8 billion on m a and growth projects excluding maintenance capital in addition we have committed but not yet spent almost 6 5 billion on projects and m a we continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted aa2 rating if we maintain this rating at a debt level of about at a debt level of about three times the last 12 months ebitda we have over 8 5 billion available to invest today and based on our last 12 months investable cash flow we expect to have almost 5 5 billion over the remaining there and three quarter years therefore in total we have about 14 billion remaining to invest the almost 2 billion we have spent so far and the 14 billion available gives us a total of almost 16 billion of total available capacity for fy 2018 through fy 2022 so you can see we have spent over 10 and committed over half of our total available capacity now to begin the review of our business segment results i ll turn the call back over to seifi seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you scott please turn to slide 16 asia where we continue to deliver strong sales and profit growth i was just in asia last week and remain very excited about our growth opportunities we have an excellent and committed team running our business in asia at this point we have not seen any meaningful impact on our business or projects as a result of any trade issues between the united states and china it will be interesting however to see how the lunar new year holiday impacts the economy this coming quarter we remain focused on our business in china and very positive on our long term growth prospects in china sales were cheapest and lower than last year with 2 lower volume and 3 unfavorable currency partially offset by better pricing and higher energy pass through excluding the impact of plant sale last year that scott mentioned sales were up 16 again excluding the impact of plant sale last year volumes were up 17 with new projects primarily lu an driving about 10 of the increase while the base business and the small acquisitions accounted for the rest overall for the region overall pricing for the region was up 1 versus last year the seventh consecutive quarter of year on year price improvement the merchant business pricing was up 3 with positive pricing across all subregions in asia the strong volumes and pricing plus favorable productivity increased both profits and margins ebitda increased by over 20 and ebitda margin improved 920 basis points excluding prior year plants sale ebitda was up more than 30 and margins were up 470 basis points sequentially profits and margins increased due to productivity and the full running rate from lu an now i would like to turn the call back over to scott to discuss our american results scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you seifi please turn to slide 17 for a review of our americas results for the quarter sales grew 9 with both volume and price up 2 higher energy pass through added 7 more than offsetting a negative 2 currency effect volumes from new plants and north america based merchant were both positive and overcame weaker latin america volumes and customer planned maintenance outages negatively impacting hydrogen volumes overall this is the eighth consecutive quarter of volume improvement for the region the impact of our pricing actions is also gaining momentum as price was up 2 the best result in three years merchant pricing was up 4 americas ebitda increased 4 as improved volume and price as well as higher equity affiliate income due to better results in mexico were partially offset by increased costs while the team remains focused on driving productivity we continue to see higher transportation and maintenance costs ebitda margin excluding the impact of energy pass through was up 50 basis points sequentially planned customer maintenance outages negatively impacted both hydrogen volumes and maintenance costs excluding the impact of energy pass through sequential ebitda margin was down 130 basis points now i would like to turn the call back over to simon to discuss our other segments simon simon moore vice president of investor relations thank you scott please turn to slide 18 for a review of our emea results sales were up 2 primarily driven by 1 better volumes and 2 higher price 6 higher energy pass through was offset by unfavorable currency and the contract modification in india as scott mentioned this change to a tolling agreement reduces sales and volumes but has no profit impact price and volume were both up for the quarter as we continued to see solid demand in the merchant market and positive results from our pricing actions merchant price grew 4 for the quarter we did not see any negative impacts associated with the brexit uncertainty during this quarter ebitda was nearly flat as positive volume and price were offset primarily by negative currency ebitda margin was 31 6 down 70 basis points excluding the impact of higher energy pass through ebitda margin was up 80 basis points primarily due to the india plant contract change sequentially volumes were down on seasonality price was slightly positive but rounded to flat the ebitda decrease was primarily due to currency and a reduction in equity affiliate income following a seasonally strong fourth quarter in our italy joint venture now please turn to slide 19 for a brief comment on our global gases segment which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs sales and ebitda declined due to lower project activity as we approach the conclusion of the jazan asu sale of equipment project we continue to expect the jazan asu project on stream in phases in fiscal 2019 and as previously communicated we expect the jazan asu overall to be a headwind for fy 19 versus fy 18 now please turn to slide 20 for a brief comment on our corporate segment which includes our lng business our helium container business and our corporate costs sales and profits were about flat compared to prior year with no significant change in the lng business we continue to be optimistic about future prospects for the lng business but have not yet seen the industry optimism translate into firm orders now i m pleased to turn the call back over to seifi for a discussion of our outlook seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you simon as you all know very well we are living in a very uncertain world today air products can t predict or control worldwide political or economic developments but we do have control over our operational performance and our growth investments and we are confident we will continue to deliver on the commitments we have made despite the world events we have not seen any material impact on air products at this point from these global uncertainties as demonstrated by our results in the first quarter our team around the world continues to be very excited about air products future our five point strategic plan provides the framework to drive our success going forward and our safety productivity and operating performance continue to provide the foundation for our continued growth we have the financial capacity the opportunities and the team to successfully win key growth projects now please turn to slide no 21 we are all working hard every day to be the safest most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world providing excellent service to our customers despite increased economic and political uncertainty our guidance for the fiscal year 2019 remains unchanged and is in a range of 8 05 to 8 30 per share and despite currency headwinds at midpoint our guidance represents 10 growth over our very strong fiscal year 2018 performance for quarter two of fiscal year 2019 our earnings per share guidance is 1 80 to 1 90 at midpoint up 8 over last year we continue to expect our capital expenditure to be in the range of 2 3 billion to 2 5 billion for fiscal year 2019 and finally please turn to slide no 22 as always our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at air products this is what allows us to continue to generate our superior safety and operational performance i want to thank all of our 16 000 people around the world for their total commitment and hard work and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of working together now we are delighted to answer your questions questions and answers operator thank you and we ll first hear from don carson of susquehanna don carson susquehanna financial group analyst thank you good morning seifi seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning don how are you doing don carson susquehanna financial group analyst very well thank you you commented that you can t control economic events obviously but could you sort of do a walk around the world just in terms of what you re seeing in your base business given that we re hearing that in many regions industrial production is slowing seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer sure i start from asia we continue to see very good growth in countries like korea taiwan malaysia indonesia all of those countries india out of those countries with respect to china we i have not seen any slowdown yet the only thing that concerns us and we are keeping an eye on it is how is the lunar new year in china play out that means that our people going to take longer shutdowns because of the way that the chinese new year is kind of situated calendar wise that people would take longer weekends or longer that is the only thing that we are watching and quite frankly that is one of the reasons that contrary to our usual practice we have given you a guidance of 0 10 rather than 0 05 a spread for this quarter so that is as i said we have not seen any significant slowdown in our business in china but the lunar new year and how it plays can have an effect and that is why you can say that we are conservative in our guidance for the quarter the rest of asia is doing very well as i said when we come in europe europe is flat again the concern that we have is all of the turmoil with respect to brexit what would be the effect in the next few months on the pound exchange rate and also the business in our business in united kingdom as you know we have a big business there so that is again another reason why we were conservative in our estimates for the second quarter in the united states things have not changed since we have talked last time there is a slowdown of industrial production but we do not see any material impact on our results and that is why we are not changing our overall estimate for the year we do expect a stronger second half than the first half because of some of the projects and pricing actions that we have taken and that is why we remain very confident about the guidance that we have given for the year in addition i also have to add that things remain very very negative in latin america but that s not a big part of our business don carson susquehanna financial group analyst ok and then a quick follow up i noticed on slide 13 your price cost gap narrowed considerably it was only a 0 01 negative delta versus 0 14 last quarter so how are you able to narrow that delta specifically on the cost side where it was only a 0 06 drag this quarter versus 0 16 last quarter seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well as you recall in the last call i was very transparent about my dissatisfaction with our cost performance so obviously everybody took that to heart and we have worked very hard on productivity to improve our cost position and we hope to see that number improving as we go forward so we have taken action don don carson susquehanna financial group analyst all right thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator and next we ll hear from christopher parkinson of credit suisse christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you given the circumstances your result in asia was pretty solid can you just parse out the key volume drivers outside of lu an as well as your intermediate term expectations post the new year just that and any quick views on the merchant market operates etc would be helpful thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning chris sure obviously lu an was about 10 of the growth but the rest of the growth we are reporting asia results the rest of the growth is coming from as i said china despite what everybody said a slowdown a slowdown but they are growing at 6 6 so we see the benefit of that in our merchant business but in addition as i said countries like korea taiwan indonesia malaysia they are doing very well and they contributed to our positive results scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer maybe if i could just add also that this is also an area that we saw good cost improvement as seifi mentioned earlier nice cost performance in the quarter too christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you that s helpful perfect and then also you mentioned plant refinery outages in north america affecting results but this was also a theme last year regarding the year on year comp can you just comment if the planned downtime was in line with your initial expectations and then also just what are your updated views on hydrogen demands intermediate to long term in the u s globally etc thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer sure first of all the plant outages are totally in line with expectations as we grow our business and we have more and more hydrogen plants obviously to turn around there are more turnarounds but there is nothing out of line they are all in accordance with our expectation there is nothing unexpected has happened with respect to hydrogen demand obviously a significant driver for our hydrogen demand in the u s is how many miles people drive and the gasoline demand but that continuous to remain stable as for the future as you know we have announced two new hydrogen plants that we are going to build liquid hydrogen plants we see significant growth opportunities for liquid hydrogen and in terms of the so called gaseous hydrogen there are projects being discussed in the united states in the gulf coast and other areas that would require significant amounts of hydrogen for the production of chemicals and we will obviously participate on that so overall we remain very positive christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you very much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator next we ll hear from robert schwartz of goldman sachs robert schwartz goldman sachs analyst thanks very much good morning seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning bob how are you doing robert schwartz goldman sachs analyst i m doing well thank you it strikes me that over the last couple of years you ve moved toward maybe lifting or improving the stability of the organization by some of the divestitures you ve made and then enhancing some of these large gasification projects and yet your multiple continues to go in the wrong direction so i m wondering can you help frame through your competitive advantage and what it means to have such a significant on site presence and sort of how you see that developing and what it means to the volatility of your business seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well bob first of all thank you for your comment we definitely have moved in the direction of stabilizing the business getting the company focused on the right business and significantly enhancing our on site presence because that is a much more stable business and we have changed our business model to get into syngas production where we see significant opportunity we do have a lot of cash on hand we have a very strong balance sheet and with the acquisition of the technologies from shell and ge and others we are in a very strong position to be the leader in gasification and there are many many many many opportunities as for why our multiple i m not selling air product stock i mean my job is to articulate our strategy and tell our investors what we are doing and then they will decide the multiples i think the market is underestimating our ability to deploy the cash and i also understand that there is a lot of concern about gasification it s a new area there was a lot of concern when we announced lu an about what is this do you know how to run gasifiers and all of that i m hoping that as we go forward we demonstrate that we can run these facilities and as we sign more large deals which will significantly strengthen our portfolio that the investors will give us due consideration in time as i said my job is not to argue about the multiple my job is to explain and articulate out a strategy and i think in time the investors will see where we are as compared to our competitors robert schwartz goldman sachs analyst i appreciate that can i ask you very briefly on the shell technology you guys have mentioned applying that maybe to help solve some of the high sulfur resid streams as companies try to adhere to the i o 2020 standards and 2020 is pretty close is that something that looks like there s some development there or is it getting pushed out is this a meaningful opportunity or just something maybe on the periphery for that business seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer bob it is a meaningful opportunity the best example of that is the 8 billion project that we are doing in saudi arabia that is all about taking the bottom of the refinery and gasifying it and upgrading it because they wouldn t be able to sell that to the market for fueling the ships so that is the message this opportunity is great there is a great opportunity the issue is that a lot of people are not taking action because they are hoping that the implementation of i o 20 will be delayed and as i m sure you know there is a lot of lobbying going on by some of the industry in the united states to do that but in the long term that is going to be a significant opportunity yes robert schwartz goldman sachs analyst great thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you sir operator and next we ll hear from jeffrey zekauskas of j p morgan jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst thanks very much good morning seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning jeff how are you doing jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst good in the different slides you spoke about merchant pricing being up 3 in the americas 3 in asia 4 in emea but the actual price in the slides for each of the geographic segments is lower it s 2 in the americas 1 in asia and 2 in europe what accounts for the difference what s pushing down that price level and in the overall slide that describes price it seems that costs are going up faster than price is that the right comparison or is there a real price benefit and the costs are more internal or having to do with turnarounds or something like that seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer yes i ll have scott answer the question that you had asked but on the cost side the cost side is related to increasing our capabilities but i like scott to answer your first question go ahead scott scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning jeff thanks for the question so one of the things that we ve introduced in the last quarter or so is a we refer to it as a merchant on merchant price increase and price change so as you know air products has a large percentage of our portfolio 50 in on sites so when we go through the slides we ll do price over the entire business which two thirds or so in the u s is tonnage so we felt the 1 for ap and the 1 for asia and then 2 for americas and 2 for emea that s over the total portfolio of those businesses what we thought would be helpful is to also additionally provide you with a merchant on merchant that looks at the price change in this case increase total air products 3 asia 3 4 and 4 for americas emea price increase on the merchant business so it provides you a little bit more insight as to what s going on on that portion of the business as opposed to spread across the entire company hopefully i was clear on that seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer is that clear jeff jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst yes that s clear and then for my follow up is it the case that your pension costs this year will drop about 65 million from 90 million to 25 million or so and when i looked at your income statement the non controlling interest was 9 5 million i think versus 6 9 million last year and i would have thought the non controlling interest number would have been larger given that lu an is now on stream and is quite profitable is there something eccentric in non controlling interest number and what about seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer jeff scott can address those things we have talked about that he has all of the regions scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer sure hi this is scott so first on pension well you expect to have a little bit of a drop this year versus last year on pension maybe for the year total pension expense and let me put it that way maybe it s like 30 or so from an expense perspective and by the way no jeff you re always interested in the cash flow statement our contributions for the pension should be in the same line so we think non cash expense versus contribution on the pensions to be about a wash and call it 30 and change then in terms of non controlling interest you are right lu an was the biggest part of it recognizing that we had i think it was in the third quarter of last year we had a pure air adjustment that was a little bit of an anomaly because of the way that that arrangement was canceled but i think going forward we would expect to see by the way we also have a venture with a minority position over in asia as well so that s going to move around the non controlling interest but the biggest item in there is going to be lu an going forward jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst was pension expense 90 million last year scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer give me a second including a bunch of the non gaap stuff that we had in there i think it was up about that level now i ll keep my comments here around kind of the ongoing underlying to be was a little bit lower than that and all in was something in that order jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst ok great thank you so much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you jeff operator next we ll hear from vincent andrews of morgan stanley vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you and good morning everyone if i could just ask on the price cost equation as was mentioned before you re down to sort of a negative 0 01 in the fiscal first quarter should we anticipate as we move through the balance of the year that price is going to exceed cost inflation or is it going to stay kind of the way things are seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer that is our goal vincent vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst you think you re going to achieve it seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer we always want to see a price increase and a cost increase that is our goal yes vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst ok and if i could ask you on the dividend and i ll preface this by noting that you have almost a 3 yield in your dividend aristocrat but the increase this year was a lot less than the last couple of years and it s less than sort of the eps growth that you re anticipating so i m just wondering if there s any particular reason the dividend increase wasn t larger seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer yes we had promised the investors and we keep our promise that our dividend will the 2 5 to 3 of the stock price and we right now increased the dividend to be at around 3 so if next quarter the stock price goes up significantly which obviously we hope so then we will increase the dividend vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst ok thank you very much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer now that is the guiding principle vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst ok that s very helpful thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator steve byrne of bank of america steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes thank you is it reasonable to assume that the incremental ebitda margin on lu an is well above 50 and would it have been even better if you had built the gasifier rather than buying it seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well steve how do you want me to answer that question without giving a lot of information to our competitors which is not necessary obviously you are very right that ebitda margin on that business is over 50 actually a lot better than 50 yes steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst and seifi what drives the attractiveness of the gasifier that you have the intellectual property that gives you an edge seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer yes absolutely the fact that we own the technology we have inherited the people who know what the hell they are doing and we were able to take over those gasifiers and run them very efficiently and more efficiently than they would otherwise run and that is why the profitability is higher because we are creating value for our partners because we are running that plant very efficiently and obviously as a result we are seeing the good results yes owning the shell technology is by far the biggest competitive advantage that we have and also the ge technology that is putting us in two advantages no 1 we know what we are doing but no 2 owning these technologies is giving us visibility to projects way before everybody knows about it because if somebody is thinking about a project 10 years from now the first thing they do as you know in the field of study and all of that they select a technology therefore they talk to us there before they even have a project or announce a project or issue a request for quotation so we end up having a three four or five year head start on our competitors steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst and this plant that was a forced shutdown in china by the government should we assume that was an older plant that didn t have a take or pay contract seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer that plant that was shut down has nothing to do with gasification as you know it s a seed plant it s a plant that we have been supplying oxygen to since 2005 that plant was in the middle of a city so it is not a surprise that in time the city grows and therefore that plant either has to move or gets shut down so right now that plant has been shut down we did have a take or pay contract on that but the take or pay contract obviously at the end of the day if the plant is shut down it s force majeure and you have to deal with that but that s not a material part of our business and in the future do we have other plants who are in the middle of cities that might be shut down smaller plants that can happen too so it s not a big surprise steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer sure operator next we ll hear from kevin mccarthy of vertical research partners kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning seifi you indicated that you are very confident in your ability to deploy capital into high return projects can you elaborate on that is it the case that you ve got such a target rich environment that even if macro economics don t cooperate you ve got plenty to choose from on the menu and then second can you give us an update on the yankuang gasification project and what the timing of that looks like these days seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well good morning kevin thank you very much for your good questions no 1 with respect to opportunities the opportunities that we are working on these gasification projects they are not driven by the economy they are driven by the strategic decision by countries like china india indonesia uzbekistan and all of these other places to become independent of oil they had the cold resources and they want to convert that to chemicals so as a result the reason i m very confident is because currently we are working on more than 52 of these projects so if they all materialize it would require 70 billion of investments so we have positioned ourselves properly we have chosen the technology we have the people and we are well positioned and we have the cash to invest and therefore that is what makes me confident and whatever happens to the economy i think these countries will need to do these projects in order to become independent strategically from oil so with respect to the yankuang project that project is a huge project it s about a 12 billion project and we are working on that with yankuang in trying to develop that there are obviously environmental issues investment issues and all of that and we expect that project to be on a stream somewhere around 2022 and we will give you an update as we go forward kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst ok and secondly if i may can you talk about the modification of your contract in india i imagine if you re moving to a tolling arrangement we should expect your sales to decline and your margins to rise so that there s no net profit impact to your emea segment i guess a is that correct and b if possible maybe you can comment on some of those effects in terms of magnitude seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well first of all you are analyzing it absolutely correctly when it becomes a tolling thing then the price of natural gas is not put into our sales and therefore it will reduce our sales but improve our margin with no effect on the bottom line the reason that that has happened is that our partner in india had found a way that if they do it that way it is beneficial to them from a tax point of view and obviously from our point of view we still get the same dfc it doesn t change but in terms of the optics for the results you are right it decreases sales and increases the margins that ok kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes thank you so much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator pj juvekar of citi has our next question pj juvekar citi analyst yes hi good morning seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning pj how are you pj juvekar citi analyst good so seifi you got good merchant on merchant pricing can you just review merchant utilization rates around the world i think last year you had mentioned that china utilization was close to 90 is that still the case and this good pricing that you saw which end markets or which industries were you able to raise prices to seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer pj first of all if i may just go around the world china if you take all of china the utilization rate is only about 56 57 but china is a very big country there are pockets in china where our utilization is about 90 92 and that is what is giving us the pricing power utilization rates in europe are still at around 75 76 and the same thing is in the united states but again even in europe or in the u s there are pockets as you know industrial gases the merchant business is very very local so we can have a lot of capacity in california but no capacity in pennsylvania so we obviously analyze these things in detail and take action as appropriate with respect to the end markets there is no specific end market that is driving this it is just the utilization of the plant in the specific geography that you are located pj juvekar citi analyst ok thank you and then secondly seifi you haven t been buying back stock and i know the preference is to invest in high return projects but why not buy back some stock which gives you flexibility to take advantage of any market dislocation seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer we are not buying stock and we don t plan to buy stock because we think if you do the math that you can do better than i do if you have projects like lu an to invest the return for the investors is a lot higher than us going and wasting that cash on giving money to a bunch of people who are going to go away and will not be a longer term shareholder so it is a very economic decision i think people who buy stock are people who have run out of steam in terms of growth and therefore the only way that they can make shareholders happy is to announce stock buyback programs we have the opportunity to invest our money in projects that in the long term will generate and have a lot more value for our shareholders than buying back stock and as you know i m a big shareholder and i m very passionate about this because i want to make more money in the long term not to get cash this afternoon and then disappear pj juvekar citi analyst very interesting thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator next we ll hear from duffy fischer of barclays duffy fischer barclays analyst yes good morning fellows question just on the wind now that it s up and running for three months how is it running no 1 what lessons learned have you had from that and then second one is just have you closed the ge deal yet seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer for your first question i don t want to jinx ourselves so i m going to be knocking on wood a little bit the lu an project operation is going very well all four gasifiers are running at capacity our customer has the need for the product their business is doing very well they are taking all of the syngas and converting it to chemicals and selling it and making money so up to now it has been very positive i am very very very proud of our team down there we have something like 400 people working on this gasifier and running it every day and we have as i have always been telling investors we know how to run process plants if we run a hydrogen plant we should be able to run a gasifier but i have to say that the acquisition of the shell technology and having those people on our team has significantly helped us to be able to do that so from that point of view we are doing very well scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer ge have we closed ge seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer yes with respect to the ge we have closed the ge yes and we are in the process of duffy fischer barclays analyst ok great seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer yeah thank you very much duffy fischer barclays analyst yes thank you guys seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator next we ll here from jim sheehan of suntrust jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you good morning what is your outlook for the lng business in the second half of the year please seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well jim as you know our lng business is the kind of business that you either get a big contract or you don t get a big contract so i don t want to make too much of a prediction here but the signs are positive that means that it is possible that we would be awarded some additional contracts and that is one of the reasons that maybe we are a little bit more optimistic about confirming our results but these things are not done until they are done there are a lot of projects on the drawing board as you know and if anything happens we will obviously make an appropriate announcement but i have to say that i m more optimistic today than i was six months ago jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst great and in your full year guidance what are you guys assuming for the corporate segment please seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer in terms of what jim jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yes in terms of your incremental change from fiscal 2018 to 2019 just trying to get some color on how to model the corporate segment seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well i think that the corporate segment in terms of the cost of running the company on a day to day basis our finance department legal department it department and all of that you know how we operate you shouldn t expect much of a change there i mean that is going to be a steady with no significant increases as far as any kind of plant sale that we might have that would show up in that sector for our lng business and all of that i think for your model assume flat and then anything that happens would be good news jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you seifi seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from john roberts of ubs john roberts ubs analyst thank you scott for the 6 3 billion in commitments on page 15 or the approximate 7 billion on page 21 whichever one you want could you remind us roughly of the pace at which the cash will go out the door against the commitment scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer hi john good morning it s going to be coming in different methods so to speak right if it s an asset buyback then that is going to come in a big check if it s an organic project these are large particularly the gasification projects the spending with curve can be three four years and so it will be lumpy so to speak driven by the nature of the project itself whether it s an asset purchase or an organic seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer but as a rule of thumb i think you should assume this year we are saying we will spend about 2 5 billion i think you should assume that in the next two years that number will go to about 3 5 billion every year john roberts ubs analyst thank you that s helpful and then on slide 13 the 0 06 unfavorable cost scott talked about a lot of things like technology engineering business development is that primarily in the americas gases segment or is a significant part of that over in global gases as well seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer it is cost increases as related to when we buy shell technology when we buy that technology ge we get a lot of people we are pursuing as i told you more than 50 gasification projects so that s another almost 100 people that you have to put in there in order to develop these projects those are the costs in terms of the section where you see that scott scott crocco executive vice president and chief financial officer a lot of that will be in corporate and spread around depending on the nature of these costs that we re building our capability but john the other item is the maintenance the planned customers outages so that s in that number as well and that s largely an america s comment with the planned turns john roberts ubs analyst ok thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer ok thank you operator next we ll hear from john mcnulty of bmo capital markets john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yeah good morning thanks for taking my question seifi you highlight a big backlog or at least potential backlog on gasification projects and i know in the past you ve targeted 10 returns on capital as you become more evidently the kind of partner of choice you ve got greater experience doing this you ve built up the technology do you see risk to the upside in terms of how to think about the returns on capital for future projects and how should we be thinking about that seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well john we have said that our minimum requirement is 10 but if we can t get a project at 25 we will do that so i think your analysis is exactly correct that as we become the partner of choice we should be able to command a higher price and obviously the other dynamic is that if our competitors are announcing 6 billion share buyback then i assume they don t have the money to compete in this project which would put us in a better position john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the color seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator david begleiter of deutsche bank david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning david how are you david begleiter deutsche bank analyst well thank you seifi we just saw in the merchant price in the americas the plus 4 are you seeing competitor support for the pricing and has there been any impact from the linde merger on pricing dynamics in the industry seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well first of all the linde merger is not closed david as you know so there is certainly no impact from that but as you know in general competitors pricing and so on i have my lawyer looking at me and saying don t say anything considering the nature of the industry so i apologize for not being able to comment on that i shouldn t comment on that david begleiter deutsche bank analyst understood and just on the guidance for the year seifi what do you need to do or see happen to get to the upper half of the guidance range for this year seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer i think what would help us is lunar new year shut down in china which is normal rather than being longer a stabilization of the discussions on brexit and making sure that our business in uk doesn t suffer and a better hopefully a few orders for the lng that would help too david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you very much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator next we ll hear from mike sison of keybanc mike sison keybanc capital markets hey guys nice quarter seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much mike mike sison keybanc capital markets seifi you had mentioned that you feel confident air products can continue to grow at 10 annually for some time and you ve talked positively about gasification is there a way to help us understand what of that 10 how much gasification can support in terms of growth over the next couple of years seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well if all of the projects that we are talking gasification actually materialize and we deploy the capital that we are talking about we will grow a lot better than 10 if we look at the conventional industrial gas business worldwide and consider that that business will grow with the gdp worldwide therefore you can expect much more than 3 to 4 growth every year so when we say 10 we expect at least 6 from gasification and larger projects but as i said if we can actually implement and deploy the capital and have 10 more projects like lu an then we will grow a lot better than 10 mike sison keybanc capital markets got it and then as a quick follow up if you had your choice which you probably do and you think about the capital deployment is it preferable to spend all the capital on gasification versus historical asus and maybe talk about that concept going forward seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well i m glad you asked the question we remain totally committed to our core business we are going to invest as much as we possibly can in our merchant business in our standard gas generators our hydrogen business and all of that so the gasification is not taking anything away from that we will be as aggressive and as enthusiastic in investing in our core business gasification is on top of that but gasification is not going to take away from our focus on our normal business we are not going to concede any market share anywhere in the world in our business our helium business our hydrogen business and we will invest in those businesses as appropriate all we are saying is that those businesses fundamentally are not going to grow much better than gdp and therefore you need to have another vehicle in order to meet our ambitious goal of delivering more than 10 and we have found that vehicle to be gasification and very large projects mike sison keybanc capital markets got it thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you very much operator next we ll hear from mike harrison of seaport global securities mike harrison seaport global securites analyst hi good morning seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer good morning mike how are you doing mike harrison seaport global securites analyst doing well thank you seifi we ve talked a little bit about the merchant business and you ve talked a little bit about utilization i was wondering if you can talk about your approach to merchant capacity in north america we ve seen you announce some merchant asu in ohio new york minnesota any details on which end markets or customer dynamics are driving the need for more capacity and what kind of utilization rates would you expect on those plants once they get up and running seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well mike that s a very good cause we remain committed as we have always been to make sure that our customers have access to competitive products so the way we approach this thing is that i mean this is our business every day when we look at an area and we see that we are operating at 90 and the market is growing we obviously go on the mission plan in order to make sure we can supply the market and then when we see an area like in minnesota where there is really very few competitors competing in there and the market is growing then it is appropriate for us to go and build a plan so our approach is focused on meeting the demands of our customers and making sure they have access to products mike harrison seaport global securites analyst all right and then was also hoping to get an update on the helium market i know that you recently announced an agreement with sonatrach in algeria any comments on the growth or pricing dynamics you re seeing in helium seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer helium is obviously a very rare commodity there are not that many places where you can produce it and we are the largest helium producer in the world so we are very committed again to meet the demands of our customers and therefore we develop helium opportunities anywhere in the world that we can possibly do we have been operating in algeria for many years and we saw an opportunity to be able to expand on our operation there and to make helium available to our customers we are very proud that right now as we speak we are the only helium producer in the world who has not declared force majeure i think we are very committed in that we always make sure that we have supply for our customers so the helium business is growing there is significant amount of rocket launches that require helium there s significant amount of growth in medical use for mri machines and all of that and air products as the leader of the helium business worldwide is committed to make sure that we have product for our customers mike harrison seaport global securites analyst all right thanks very much seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator laurence alexander of jefferies has our next question laurence alexander jefferies analyst good morning just a quick one can you give a sense for how much your backlog has gone up excluding the gasification projects given the number of announcements that were made during the quarter seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer during the quarter it hasn t gone up that much because we haven t announced too many projects but overall the backlog for our standard business is somewhere in the order of about 1 5 billion and that hasn t changed significantly laurence alexander jefferies analyst ok and for the commitments on the gasification side are those at this point basically fixed or will you have some wiggle room in terms of project financing and other ways to maybe reduce the capital investment or the capital outlay by our products for the states seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer we look at that issue on a project by project basis in terms of where it is and all of that so as you know when we announced the big project in saudi arabia we said that that project is going to be order of magnitude more than 8 billion and on that front we are going to use 40 equity and 60 project financing so it s very much driven by the specific project and the nature of the project but then it comes to a project like jiutai in china where the capital requirement is 700 million we do that 100 corporate finance it s very project driven laurence alexander jefferies analyst thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you we have time for another question we have significantly run over time so can we have one other question please operator absolutely our final question for today will come from jonas oxgaard of bernstein jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst morning guys seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer hi how are you jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst oh living the dream everyday seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer that s great that s great that s a good positive attitude jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst thank you so to go from that positive attitude to a less positive question perhaps if we can return to that plant in china that you closed down and take or pay was voided by a force majeure in the past when you talked about the gasification plants and the potential risk of china closing down gasification because of coal usage the answer has always been the take or pays are there to protect us so was there something unique about this particular one or how should i think about this in the grander context seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer i think you shouldn t the two are not comparable i mean the reason that the plant that guang plant was shut down was because it was in the middle of the city the city is growing and obviously the sil plant is an plant and it is not equipped with all of the latest technology and they didn t have the money to do that so the government shut them down the gasification plants that we are building are not in populated areas they are significant projects which are related to significant 10 billion 12 billion investments for chemical production and the possibility of those things being shut down for they are actually being built because they are environmentally friendly so there is really kind of no comparison between the two jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst ok but if they were to be shut down then the take or pays would be voided seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer well my friend it s just like saying that if there is war in venezuela they come and take over your plants like it has happened to exxon before so those are the kind of things that force majeure works both ways because we want to be protected that in case the government we have a plant supplying a sil plant and something goes wrong with our plan and they come and say you can t operate we can t be liable to the customer to kind of supply them oxygen because we are under a force majeure situation or when an air compressor blows up in a plant which we have had situations like that we declare force majeure so that we don t get sued by the customer for not supplying them oxygen to run their or hydrogen to run their refinery so that works both ways that s kind of a standard in the contract jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst ok thank you seifi ghasemi chairman president and chief executive officer thank you ok with that i would like to thank everybody for being on the call thanks for taking time from your very busy schedule and we appreciate your interest in our company thank you for the very good questions that allows us to kind of articulate our results and we look forward to talking to you next quarter with hopefully better results thank you very much operator duration 79 minutes call participants simon moore vice president of investor

allegiance bank and our employees as we look back on a very successful 2018 it was a transformative year and one that will serve as the foundation for the bank s continued growth for many years to come during 2018 we completed our core technology conversion and announced and closed our merger with post oak bank both of which expands our opportunity to continue to be houston s premier community bank we are committed to delivering personalized service to our customers and serving our communities it is this commitment and that of our dedicated employees who have worked tirelessly to create a partnership that has already produced outstanding results we re pleased to have received such a positive reaction from our combined customers in response to the merger and look forward to completing the operational integration during the first quarter of 2019 we are also extremely pleased to report record earnings of 37 3 million reflecting the continued execution of our growth strategy with record asset growth of 62 8 and diluted earnings per share growth of 80 6 2018 was our best year yet our 2018 results are highlighted by core loan growth low charge offs and the positive impact of the post oak acquisition which drove our strong performance we are particularly proud of the organic core loan growth of 294 million for the year which is a tremendous accomplishment and is attributable to our experience in highly dedicated lenders along with our committed back office support team of bankers our charge off experience continues to remain strong as evidenced by net charge offs of only 6 basis points for the year our team spirit is tremendous and is confirmed by being a repeat winner of the top workplaces award by the houston chronicle for the ninth consecutive year the feat only accomplished by 10 companies since the award program began out of 253 companies that participated we re most excited about our continued growth prospects as we enter 2019 and plan to continue our ongoing hiring efforts we are pleased with the further enhancement of our houston footprint with the branch acquisition in sugar land which we plan to complete next month and the anticipated opening of a de novo bank office on the east side of downtown houston in early 2020 next steve will describe our results in more detail followed by paul who will explain some of the numbers behind steve s narrative then we will open the call for questions steven f retzloff chairman thanks george i also welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call i would describe our fourth quarter in one word energized this applies not only to our growing enthusiasm and upbeat esprit de corps which now includes our new team members from post oak bank but also to the calculus that is driving our strong core earnings growth including acquisition accounting adjustments on october 1st we added 1 16 billion of new core loans from the acquisition we define our core loans as loans excluding our mortgage warehouse the combination of the acquired loans with our core loans at september 30th 2018 had us beginning the fourth quarter with 3 56 billion of core loans including acquisition adjustments total core loans ended the quarter at 3 66 billion which produced an increase of 104 million during the quarter an organic growth rate of 11 7 which is quite impressive particularly during an early integration of this magnitude in terms of growth rate the fourth quarter represents the second best organic growth quarter for 2018 for the trailing 12 months core loans grew 1 46 billion or 66 3 including the acquired loans from post oak core organic loan growth was a robust 294 million for the year given a slight decline in our funded mortgage warehouse lines our 12 month trailing total loan growth was 63 3 of which 12 was organic during the fourth quarter our combined lender team booked 353 million of new loans that funded to a level of 223 million by december 31st this is a significant increase from the third quarter when 240 million of new loans were generated which funded to a level of 157 million in the third quarter notably paid off loans also increased from 91 million in the third quarter to 166 million in the fourth the average size of the new organic core loans generated during the fourth quarter was 456 000 committed and 288 000 funded which reflects our continued focus on the small to medium sized business sector as being central to our super community bank strategy the weighted average interest rate charged on our new fourth quarter core loans continued to improve this quarter the average rate charge was 5 75 which is an increase of 11 basis points over the third quarter new loans at 5 64 as previously reported the weighted average rate for new core loans in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 5 35 resulting from the new loans the acquired loans which came with an average rate of 5 26 and the loan mix the period end weighted average interest rate charge on our portfolio of core loans reflect an upward trend as the quarter end weighted average rate before accrued fees and acquisition accounting increased from 5 32 as of march 31st 2018 to 5 37 as of june 30th to 5 44 as of september 30th and was now 5 47 as of december 31st 2018 also as of december 31st only a small portion of our variable rate loans are currently earning at their contractual floors paul will discuss the resulting portfolio yields and margins in his report the mix of new loan production based on fourth quarter funding levels was represented by the following four commercial categories owner occupied commercial real estate 18 3 non owner occupied commercial real estate 14 5 commercial term loans 14 1 and commercial working capital at 5 2 these four commercial categories represented 52 1 of the new funded production compared to 61 8 for the third quarter loans secured by one to four family residential real estate contributed 20 4 of the new funded core loans construction and development including land loans contributed 19 and multi family contributed 1 8 of the new funded core loans during the quarter due primarily to the acquisition the overall loan mix altered slightly during the quarter with loans secured by residential real estate increasing from 14 1 of total funded loans to 17 5 and the commercial real estate declined from 46 1 to 43 1 given that post oak had no mortgage warehouse lines or sba loans these categories declined proportionately by about one third of their prior levels other categories adjusted only slightly at the concentrations the slide deck posted on our website provides added color regarding our overall mix of loans the average funded loan size ended the year at 332 000 it is notable that the average size of the acquired loans was in the same range at 312 000 net charge offs experienced during the quarter was once again very low at 219 000 or an annualized rate of 2 basis points 2018 net charge offs were 1 57 million or 6 basis points the bank s quarter end asset quality position is solid although non performing assets increased from 56 basis points of total assets at september 30th to 72 basis points at december 31st almost all of the increase was limited to precautionary measures taken on two loan relationships which i will describe shortly the larger of the two resulted in an impairment reserve of 2 4 million which was the largest contributor to our approximately 3 million provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter non accrual loans increased during the quarter from 14 9 million to 32 9 million the change reflected 5 3 million from the acquired loans and an additional 12 6 million net increase from the existing prior allegiance relationships two relationships constituted 88 of the dollar and both have been previously identified as watch list credits the larger a prior period impaired loan at approximately 7 6 million is a hotel which although current as to payment performance has progressed slowly toward occupancy stabilization and given our disciplined approach to ongoing credit evaluations was recently reappraised the lower appraisal led to establishing an impairment reserve of approximately 2 4 million which as i mentioned was the bulk of the provision for the past quarter the second is a 3 5 million sba loan for a day care which was unable to open for the fall enrollment this past season 2019 enrollments are anticipated to lead to improved cash flows for this customer the overall loan to value after giving credit to sba guarantees and the established impairment reserves ended the year at 67 for non accrual loans and 59 for impaired loans sba loans represented 19 of the non accrual loans of which the largest loan is about half of that total we believe the collectability of the unreserved loan amount on our non accrual loans and other impaired loans as of december 31st remained quite manageable in terms of our watch list our classified loans as a percentage of total loans declined slightly ending at 2 15 at december 31st compared to 2 26 at september 30th criticized loans increased slightly to 2 86 from 2 76 of total loans despite this overall stability the specific reserves for the impaired loans increased to 16 from 11 6 during the quarter due to a large degree to the aforementioned reserve on the hotel loan total deposits increased in the fourth quarter by 1 23 billion ending december 31st at 3 66 billion for the past 12 months total deposits increased 65 4 with the acquisition year over year organic deposit growth was 7 5 highlighted by a 13 1 organic increase in non interest bearing deposits as such and with the acquired deposits the non interest bearing deposit ratio ended the quarter at 33 compared to 30 9 at december 31 2017 while wti oil prices have gravitated down since we reported last quarter to the low 50s per barrel recently allegiance continues to not focus on this sector post oak had a similar low degree of exposure and like allegiance had no reserve based lending we are evaluating the indirect exposure of the acquired loans more closely but have recognized overall strong credit quality for those identified thus far notwithstanding the recent softness in oil prices the economic data for the houston region remains positive according to the texas workforce commission data the houston msa has gained over 114 000 jobs in the 12 month period ending november 2018 in its recent economic forecast report the greater houston partnership projected the area will gain 71 000 jobs in 2019 and upwards of 120 000 new residents for the year 2018 single family homes sales reached a record level of 82 000 homes up 3 8 from 2017 and ended the year with 3 5 months of inventory average home prices were up to 240 000 an increase of 3 4 over 2017 the houston area purchasing managers index ended november at 54 9 continuing to indicate expansion unemployment was 3 8 in november down from 4 4 a year earlier finally due to a strong residential market construction appears to remain positive as building permits are up 12 for october 2018 compared to october of 2017 the overall tone with our commercial customers remains positive and the local economic outlook is strong prior to the merger allegiance bank had 16 branch locations and post oak had 13 due to its proximity to the largest post oak office we have already closed one branch merging its production staff with others one additional allegiance office closure is scheduled for the first quarter also due to their new nearby location in addition our purchase of a sugar land branch from another bank has been approved and is scheduled to close in the first quarter the existing prior post oak branch in that area will subsequently close the results of these strategic changes will be 27 branches improved location prominence and cost efficiencies i will close just as i began with the fact that we are excited and energized to be houston s largest community bank we continue to manage the bank with extraordinary performance in both the big and impactful things such as quality growth but also in the small but significant things such as community service and support the bank was recognized this past quarter as one of our officers mark vasquez received the george bailey distinguished service award from the american bankers association in october for his leadership of our response to hurricane harvey and other local community initiatives we thank all of our bankers who have contributed hours and hours of personal time to support these much needed and ongoing volunteer efforts with that i will now turn it over to our cfo paul paul p egge executive vice president chief financial officer thanks steve fourth quarter 2018 net income was 13 2 million or 0 59 per diluted share as compared to third quarter earnings of 8 9 million or 0 65 per diluted share our fourth quarter results reflect the inclusion of the post oak acquisition which impacted our results through increased scale related revenue and expense as well as some acquisition related items such as acquisition accounting accretion increased levels of cdi amortization and certain non interest expenses related specifically to the integration of the post oak transaction which we will detail later fourth quarter 2018 net interest income increased to 45 8 million or 63 5 from 28 million in the third quarter and from 27 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to growth in average earning assets as a result of the post oak transaction and continued organic growth average interest earnings assets for the fourth quarter increased 50 1 compared to the third quarter and 59 3 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 within the fourth quarter acquisition accounting accretion increased loan income by 2 7 million and reduced cd expense by 367 000 for a total positive effect on net interest income of 3 1 million in the quarter this quarter s accretion leaves 14 2 million in loan mark and 1 3 million in the cd mark tax equivalent net interest margin for the fourth quarter with 4 45 compared to 4 10 in the third quarter adjusting for the acquisition accounting accretion net interest margin would have been 4 16 for the fourth quarter representing progress from q3 s 4 10 yield on loans in fourth quarter with 5 81 versus 5 49 in the third quarter and 5 34 in the year ago quarter total yield on net interest earning assets was 5 44 for the fourth quarter and 5 12 for the third quarter and 4 93 for the year ago quarter adjusting for the acquisition accretion recorded in the fourth quarter yield on loans and total yield on earning assets would have been 5 51 to 5 18 respectively so we are seeing progress on core asset yields our increased interest income for the quarter was partially offset by the increase in interest expense associated with the increased scale of our funding base as a result of post oak acquisition and overall trends in funding cost the total costs and interest bearing liabilities was 153 basis points for the fourth and third quarters in 2018 and 100 basis points for the year ago quarter overall cost of funds for the fourth quarter was 106 basis points versus 109 basis points in the third quarter and 73 basis points in the year ago quarter excluding acquisition accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter the total cost of interest bearing liabilities would have been 158 basis points and the total cost of funds would have been 109 basis points the composition of our funding and interest expense saw some shift during the quarter due to the post oak acquisition and our continued success growing both our non interest bearing deposits and interesting bearing deposits which allowed us to decrease our level of fhlb borrowings non interest income increased to 2 3 million for the fourth quarter from 1 9 million in third quarter despite losses on the sales of the ore and ora of 429 000 during the quarter fourth quarter also represents a very nice pickup from the 1 6 million from the year ago quarter again despite those losses we experienced from the sale of ore and ora total non interest expense for the fourth quarter was 29 million compared to 19 2 million in the third quarter and included 840 000 merger related expenses the fourth quarter increase was primarily due to additional salaries and benefits that we absorbed added headcount from post oak increased occupancy expense as a result of that incremental post oak offices and an increase of about 1 million in core deposit intangible and amortization the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter decreased to 60 30 compared to 63 95 we posted in the third quarter and 66 5 for the prior year quarter despite the 840 000 in merger related expense excluding these merger related expenses and earlier core conversion expenses the efficiency ratio for the third and fourth quarters of 2018 would have been 62 19 and 58 55 respectively as steve mentioned the provision for loan losses was 3 million in the fourth quarter net charge offs this quarter were 219 000 which makes the year end net charge offs to total 1 6 million or only 6 basis points on average loan for 2018 the ending allowance at 26 3 million is 71 basis points of total loan so we mentioned the 14 2 million in loan mark remaining on the acquired loans if you were to include the loan mark the ending allowance plus loan mark to total loans is 109 basis points and 111 basis points on core loans if you were to exclude mortgage warehouse loans this compares to 97 basis points of total loans and 99 basis points of core loans at september 30th our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18 6 compared to 17 8 for the third quarter as municipal securities and bolis represent significantly smaller portions of our revenue mix bottom line our fourth quarter produced a return on average assets of 1 12 in return on average tangible equity of 11 66 we are particularly pleased with the progress in our earnings power on a pre tax pre provision basis as our pre tax pre provision roaa during the quarter was 1 63 and if you were to exclude merger related expenses it would have been 1 70 we believe we are very well positioned entering into 2019 as a significantly larger and more profitable company than we began 2018 before passing the call back to george i should note that during the fourth quarter we made some share repurchases under our board authorized share repurchase program we repurchased just over 69 000 shares at a weighted price of 30 45 per share during the quarter i will now turn the call back over to george george martinez chairman chief executive officer thank you paul operator we would now like to open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you so much operator instruction our first question comes from matt olney with stephens your line is now open matthew covington olney stephens inc analyst hey thanks good morning guys george martinez chief executive officer good morning matt matthew covington olney stephens inc analyst i want to start on the core margin the core margin reacted nicely in the fourth quarter with the post oak balance sheet i think that was pretty close to what you guys talked about previously so with that being said where do you see this core margin going in 2019 paul p egge executive vice president chief financial officer core margin in 2019 is going to be 100 a byproduct of how we re able to execute on our loan and deposit growth in the year if we re able to fully fund our core loan growth with core deposits we could see our core net interest margin expand to the extent we re less successful in execution you could see it go the other way or you could see some level of pressure we re extremely focused on 2019 on two things deposit growth just as much as prior but secondarily with the uptick in in prime that we ve experienced over the last 12 to 18 months repricing our existing renewing loans on our books as well as new loans at favorable pricing to the bank so we think the combination on executing on both of those strategies will serve to mitigate any potential pressure out there relating to margins but it s a each and every day it s a function of our execution matthew covington olney stephens inc analyst okay that s helpful paul let me ask it this way if i were to look at just the legacy allegiance balance sheet in the fourth quarter any any indication how the margin performed in the fourth quarter kind of ex post oak just trying to get a feel for what the trend was in the fourth quarter george martinez chief executive officer hey matt this is inaudible on the loan so for the whole year just to give you a feel we originated about 1 billion of new loans and we renewed about 1 billion of loans that s for the full year and in the fourth quarter on a combined basis and for the fourth quarter those origination s and renewals were at a rate higher than the third quarter and then that was higher than the second quarter so the trajectory is that we picked up a little on the average yield on loans is picked up each quarter in 18 and fourth quarter was a good quarter in that respect the renewals those loans renewed at a rate higher than the rate that were coming off of matthew covington olney stephens inc analyst what about on the liability side i think in the prepared comments there was a remark about the improved funding allowed you guys to pay down some fhlb did i hear that correctly and at what point of the quarter did we see that and what s the view on fhlb borrowings in 2019 paul p egge executive vice president chief financial officer just for perspective at this point last year we were 2 9 billion thereabout bank that had borrowings from the fhlb at 282 million as we sit today partially as a function of our execution throughout 2018 but also partially as a function of an accretive funding base that was brought on as a function as part of the post oak acquisition we re sitting at 4 65 billion in assets and we re borrowing almost 60 million less from the fhlb which from a funding mix perspective is accretive and the core rationale for that is two fold and it s very much a function of being able to execute on deposit side throughout the year as well as what we brought on as part of the post oak deal where the goal is to continue to optimize our mix first and foremost we want to be able to fund our loan growth but the second and equally prominent goal is to optimize that funding base matthew covington olney stephens inc analyst got it okay and then shifting over to the operating expenses how should we think about those expenses in 2019 remind me of the cost savings you expect from post oak do we see any of that in the fourth quarter just help me understand kind of the pace of those cost saves in 2019 paul p egge executive vice president chief financial officer you would ve seen very little in the fourth quarter and you re not going to see that much in the first quarter and i would say you ve actually you ve seen savings in the fourth quarter it s just that they ve been mitigated by transaction expenses and of course the core deposit intangible amortization which kind of came in a little core deposit intangible came in higher than initially expected and the amortization number came in higher and that mitigates kind of the effect of core cost savings we had obviously 840 000 of merger related expense that s more direct but we also had certain expenses in the fourth quarter that were redundancies so if you look at the dp line we are running through data processing we are running some redundant systems most of that goes away in the first quarter but there actually will be trails later into the year but where you ll see the operating leverage and relative operating efficiencies really expand to the improve to the positive will certainly be the second quarter more so the third quarter first quarter will still have non recurring expenses relating to the merger there will be cost savings in the first quarter which will be mitigated by one time expenses and then we will get into a run rate in the back half of the year that will be reflective of the operating efficiencies that we expect from the transaction matthew covington olney stephens inc analyst okay thanks guys i will hop back in the queue operator thank you our following question comes from brad milsaps with sandler o neill your line is now open brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst hey good morning guys paul p egge executive vice president chief financial officer good morning brad brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst paul i was writing quickly during your comments around the accretion numbers it sounds like if you got about a little over 14 million left in a loan mark and about 1 03 million in the cd mark can you tell me how the contribution broke down this quarter and then what you think the accretion schedule will look like going forward as you look out through 2019 paul p egge executive vice president chief financial officer so this quarter the cd decreased our expenses by 397 000 and the loan mark was around the accretion from loan 2 7 million expectations for 2019 would be on the cd side approximately 800 000 on the loan side so that would be a decrease in expense of approximately 800 000 through the year on the loan side the approximation would be about 7 million although that can have some variation as it relates to the behavior of the loan portfolio that we bring in and then separately wasn t part of your question but cdi if you think about the run rate on that and expense that came in higher because the cdi came in higher as the by product of the interest rate environment and that will hit our non interest expense base in 2019 to the tune of just under 4 million brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst great that s helpful that was my next question do you think just to follow on matt s expense kind of line of question do you think your third quarter run rate expenses would be less than kind of where you were in the fourth quarter of this year if that s kind of the targeted time or you kind of have the stars aligning so to speak in terms of having the cost savings out or do you think because of investments you re making at the company it would still be higher than kind of this fourth quarter run rate paul p egge executive vice president chief financial officer the way i kind of say is it s kind of like taking two steps the nie story is kind of like two steps forward one step back when you get to the point of further off in the year you ll see in the operating efficiencies but on the absolute value number we have and will continue to make incremental investments into the business if anything you ll see us targeting hiring incrementally more lenders than the one lender a year pace that we were at before to one lender a month pardon me pace that we had kind of referenced before to drive current and future growth in the bank so we will the number i don t have in front of me right now but it s i think you are going to expect that the nie the stand alone nie base of abtx grows and the cost saves will be a function of the pre deal expense base of post oak going in at an inflationary level george martinez chief executive officer and i might add brad that the ads of lenders and i ll ask ray to provide the numbers but when we just talk about the class was 2016 which was the lenders we hired that year i mean what are they up to now ray in terms of production ramon a vitulli president chief operating officer yeah brad so the class of 16 that is probably now in future quarters just roll the class of 16 into the what we call the legacy but the whole bank right now is averaging 35 million in loans per lender and class of 16 is at 35 5 million so we ll move that into the legacy and then now focus on classes of 17 18 and 19 the embedded capacity of 17 and 18 classes is right around 340 million if you take where they are now to get to that 35 million of average george martinez chief executive officer so we re excited about the opportunities in what i m trying getting at is that if we can bring on those lenders over the year that s just going to give us a lot of capacity for the future brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst that s helpful and ray maybe just one follow up just kind of on lending in general now that you have the combined companies together what s your sense of kind of what the loan growth opportunity is in 2019 in percentage terms ramon a vitulli president chief operating officer well we ll see how the percentage turns out i d say just on the origination side which is what we like the leading indicator we were somewhere around we originated 900 million 950 million in 2018 and that s 220 million a quarter if you look at the fourth quarter which was around 350 million that should be it should be similar to that so 1 5 times what we were doing we ve gone from currently from 73 lenders to now 107 so it s right around 1 5 times of what we experienced in 2018 as far as the origination side we ll see what happens with the waterfall chart to see how our growth ends up but it ll start with the origination george martinez chief executive officer we re also quite pleased in the fourth quarter that a pretty much proportional amount of our new production came from the post oak side that lending team that we brought over so they hit the ground running and we re really encouraged by that brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst great that s helpful thank you guys very much operator thank you so much our follow on question comes from mike belmes with kbw your line is now open michael belmes kbw analyst hey good morning george martinez chief executive officer good morning michael belmes kbw analyst so just following up on the loan growth question in the fourth quarter were the level of payoffs paydowns kind of above or below expectations george martinez chief executive officer slightly above but when you take a 1 5 times the on a combined basis it may be slightly elevated but nothing unusual as far as the payoffs michael belmes kbw analyst got you so it sounds like then you guys have had really impressive organic loan growth this past quarter that it s likely to continue at maybe this same level going forward then george martinez chief executive officer we feel confident about what we re doing yes michael belmes kbw analyst perfect and then coming back to the core margin appreciate the color on accretable yield and whatnot from interest rate sensitivity position you guys are still targeting neutral i m assuming so we could kind of expect maybe a flattish plus or minus a couple of basis points depending on funding for the core name right george martinez chief executive officer i d say so i mean if you re going off the alco interest rate risk modeling which of course is flawed to a degree since it s thinking about solely parallel shifts but thanks in part to the acquired assets we re actually gone from being slightly liability sensitive to being slightly asset sensitive on the overall balance sheet but our target is to remain neutral and really try not to take interest rate risk instead inaudible and or grow the business to growing loans and deposits michael belmes kbw analyst perfect and then just one last one from me on the tax rate you talked about the shift and kind of your non taxable securities and loans and whatnot was the fourth quarter maybe a good run rate to use going forward george martinez chief executive officer i d say so michael belmes kbw analyst perfect thanks for taking my question george martinez chief executive officer as we continue to grow just with a lesser focus on tax preferential revenue you may see a trend see our tax rate trend incrementally up as opposed to down but i think where it s at is inaudible michael belmes kbw analyst got it thanks operator thank you our following question comes from daniel mannix with raymond james your line is now open daniel mannix raymond james analyst hey good morning george martinez chief executive officer good morning daniel mannix raymond james analyst just want to start by going back to deposit so you talked about fhlb declination recently you re sitting at about 100 on the loan to deposit ratio can you talk about what your comfort level is with that ratio as you look forward here into 2019 and beyond and along those lines if you are to see some outsized growth on the loan side talk about how you think about the trade off between that and accelerating deposit cost to help fund that growth paul p egge executive vice president chief financial officer the way we kind of think about funding our loan growth if there s organically a little bit of a timing delay when we bring on our lenders wherein they re able to grow loans generally speaking that s when they re able to grow their deposit book and that s where kind of that s a micro level we re in on a macro level we use wholesale funds to help manage that differential and that s where we tend to have that s how and why we have wholesale funds on our balance sheet so our goal is to only really use the wholesale funding fhlb principally in managing that timing differential that you see play out on a macro level and the extent to which we re using fhlb funding is going to be a byproduct of our success and funding our core loan growth to core deposit we ve got a lot of initiatives in place from treasury management another standpoint we re getting full relationships from our lending customers but we are very aware of the reality and the challenge in doing that so that s where fhlb fundings and other sources of funding play into the mix greg you have inaudible george martinez chief executive officer yes i ll just i would just add just two things to follow up with paul one paul mentioned treasury management we ve gone from a basically a one person team to a five person team in our treasury management sales which is three treasury management sales and two what we call on boarding specialists to help collaborate with all the bank offices to generate that non interest income or non interest bearing deposits that we enjoy from our business customers the other thing to touch on is just with the combination steve had mentioned there were some overlap but those back office that don t have overlap are actually distinct markets that we re now we ll be able to enjoy kind of a cross sell of deposit growth for example we already have customers allegiance did not have presence in certainly in sugar land the woodlands conroe so we re already having customers open up accounts in those offices we haven t even converted the systems yet that s a pretty good sign the and conversely with post oak post oak customers did not have let s say out in katy or gulf freeway or clear lake so as far as the footprint in our deposit opportunity we re very encouraged by the footprint of the brick and mortar offices daniel mannix raymond james analyst that s a great color thank you wanted to move on to capital mix according to our math it looks like it s going to be growing at a pretty nice clip going forward here can you talk about what the capital priorities are with the buyback in place now how do you think about potential dividend looking at that trade off versus your organic growth and potential m a opportunities george martinez chief executive officer the number one and what we believe is the highest value use of our capital is growing the business but we are fortunately in a position where our returns on tangible capital are getting quite healthy and we plan on kind of continuing to build on that so it does create a new level of capital flexibility that we have not necessarily had it in the 11 year history of our high growth bank so it does create new conversations around the boardroom and that s why we re very pleased to have the board share repurchase authorization in place hadn t put it in place in the third quarter before it got popular and we re very happy to put that into use a little bit here in the fourth quarter so that i think it s kind of the first step we like to value and benefit of what that does to provide liquidity to our shareholders and then otherwise we re going appreciate our capital flexibility for m a purposes and the discussion as it relates to a dividend would be a board level discussion down the road daniel mannix raymond james analyst got it just one more if i could just wanted to end with just your pulse on the competitive landscape in houston over the last excuse me couple weeks we ve heard a lot of focus on the particular market so just wanted to again get your pulse on it and understanding if m a has created any opportunity for you guys to gain market share potential hiring any disgruntled lenders out there that you guys have been able to pick up thank you paul p egge executive vice president chief financial officer well i don t know about disgruntled but we have made we made hires in 2018 few of those came from through acquisition where we were able to get the lender and they did not go with the bank that was the purchaser so those opportunities to continue in 2018 collectively we interviewed 34 candidates qualified candidates for lending or deposit gathering position so that candidate flow is still very good it is competitive but usually once we get or able to get the quality lenders here the environment here has fostered as we talked about this class of 16 in three years that class of 16 has already met basically achieved deposit loans and deposit levels that were at the level of the legacy lenders so we re encouraged by the candidate flow and what we can do in 2019 daniel mannix raymond james analyst all right that s it from me thanks gentlemen george martinez chief executive officer all right operator thank you operator instructions we have a following up question from matt olney from stephens your line is now open matthew covington olney stephens inc analyst hey thanks for taking the follow up i just want to go back to credit quality i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks there were two loans legacy loans that i guess drove some of the non accrual increase i believe that the size of those loans was a little bit bigger than i was expecting relative to your traditional sweet spot business loans below 0 5 million can you just kind of remind me of the details behind that and were those sba loans you said just any more details about how you guys got involved in those loans would be appreciated george martinez chief executive officer well one thing is just because the average loan size is in that 300 000 range we obviously do loans up to the 10 milllion 12 million size range inaudible loan relationships so obviously there s an entire scale there so one of them was a hotel loan that we funded the construction on a few years ago and it s just been kind of a little bit slower in getting its occupancy up it was benefited actually a little bit for a time period due to the harvey experience and where a lot of people stayed in the hotel for a temporary period of time which kind of masked its real organic business base and but it s growing a little bit and it just doesn t have quite the cash flow we would like to see there was a lot of equity put into it by the borrower and we were comfortable with it in the underwriting and but we ve since put it on non accrual just as really to be cautious about it and he is current on his payments but the appraisal which really looks at where the occupancy is today and the rate of acceleration of the occupancy and it came in low and so we just simply put in a reserve for that one and the other one is an sba loan that first one the hotel is not sba the second one is matthew covington olney stephens inc analyst got it and so as far as the provision expense in the fourth quarter i missed what the comments were on that was that provision expense as a result of specific allowance on that hotel loan or was the provision expense in fourth quarter more from the growth george martinez chief executive officer more from the hotel i mean it was the 3 million total provision expense in that hotel we actually increased and put in a reserve for that hotel of 2 4 million if we had not put that in there it would have been like say 600 so it was large part due to that one hotel loan and there obviously there s a lot of other moving parts in there as well but net net that was a big contributor to it matthew covington olney stephens inc analyst so i guess how should we be thinking about provision expense for loan losses in 2019 give given that healthy growth that you talked about previously george martinez chief executive officer they ve just thinking in terms of you have your growth you have your net charge offs and then you have the purchased loans that come back in through being re underwritten by the bank as they renew we will just continue to factor those into our model obviously we look at the qualitative factors in the model as well but when you get to the end of the quarter and you assessed your portfolio you take everything into consideration when you do that so i don t there s nothing left to appreciate from what we currently have experienced so going forward it would all be strictly from growth and any charge off rate and i have no evidence that indicates that would be incremental over what we ve experienced historically matthew covington olney stephens inc analyst okay thanks for the comments operator thank you i am showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to george martinez for any closing remarks george martinez chief executive officer once again we appreciate your time and interest in allegiance we look forward to speaking to you again in the future thank you very much operator ladies

washington indebted borrowers increasingly take out high interest adjustable rate loans that are packaged into securities and sold to investors eager for a better rate of return everything s fine while the economy is growing but when it slows those borrowers could default causing problems to cascade through the financial system if this all sounds like the subprime housing market in the boom years before the 2008 financial crisis you re right and that s what increasingly has regulators lawmakers ratings agencies and some market watchers worried this time however the borrowers in this credit bubble aren t homeowners taking out mortgages they re hundreds of u s companies with weaker credit ratings many of them well known such as uber and burger king taking out so called leveraged loans those loosely regulated loans often are used to fund corporate deal making but those deals known as leveraged buyouts can go bad because of the large debt load as happened with the demise last year of toys r us combined there is about 1 15 trillion in outstanding u s leveraged loans a record that is double the level five years ago and those loans increasingly are being made with less protection for lenders and investors any fair minded look at the leveraged loan market should cause significant alarm by anybody concerned about financial stability and the inevitable upcoming economic downturn said dennis kelleher president of better markets a group that advocates stricter financial regulation you put all these pieces together it s a witches brew the risks aren t nearly as widespread as they were during the housing bubble when the percentage of all mortgages that were subprime jumped to about 20 percent leveraged loans while growing rapidly account for less than 5 percent of the more than 42 trillion u s fixed income debt market which also includes corporate and municipal bonds still the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of the currency the bank of england the international monetary fund and the bank for international settlements a consortium of 60 central banks all have raised concerns recently about the growth of the leveraged loan market and the potential risks to the financial system in an economic slowdown former federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen went public this fall with her worries about what she called a huge deterioration in the standards for those loans which make it easier for indebted companies to take on more debt if we have a downturn in the economy there are a lot of firms that will go bankrupt i think because of this debt she told the financial times it would probably worsen a downturn and presumed democratic presidential candidate sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts is pressing u s regulators for answers about oversight of the market i am concerned that the large leveraged lending market exhibits many of the characteristics of the pre 2008 subprime mortgage market she wrote in a november letter to key regulatory agencies even jamie dimon ceo of jpmorgan chase who last week dismissed concerns that the leveraged loan market represented a potential systemic risk warned that there could be problems for some lenders outside the conventional banking system someone s going to get hurt there dimon said on an earnings call last week referring to leveraged loan losses if a recession hits toys r us loaded up on leveraged loan debt when it was purchased in a leveraged buyout in 2005 by private equity firms bain capital and kkr and co and real estate investment trust vornado realty trust the debt burden led the toy retailer to file for bankruptcy protection in 2017 after it was unable to refinance the debt burger king used a 6 75 billion leveraged loan to help fund its 2014 purchase of tim horton s the canadian coffee and doughnut chain and uber last year raised 1 5 billion in its second leveraged loan issuance following a 1 15 billion one in 2017 according to the wall street journal leveraged loans in and of themselves aren t bad they are simply a credit instrument employed with companies that already have a lot of debt and those companies are fairly common about two thirds of u s companies have enough debt that independent credit raters have them categorized as a higher risk to repay than companies with so called investment grade ratings which makes them off limits to many institutional investors because those companies with non investment grade ratings are highly leveraged the chances are greater that they won t pay back a loan for that reason the interest rate needs to be higher to offset that risk the higher interest rate makes the loans desirable to investors seeking a greater return on their money the fed s benchmark federal funds rate is now at a range between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent the yield on 10 year treasury bills is about 2 8 percent but yields on leveraged loans can be higher than 10 percent if an investor buys into the riskiest and most speculative segment of the market safer leveraged loans still can pay several points higher than a treasury bill in those ways leveraged loans are similar to the junk bonds that became popular in the 1980s and fueled corporate deals but there s an important difference junk bonds those rated below investment grade by ratings companies are securities that are traded under the oversight of the

basis points to 3 17 compared to 3 35 for the same quarter of 2017 the margin contraction primarily reflected a 45 basis point increase in the cost of funds to 1 04 for the three months ended december 31 2018 from 0 59 for the same three months of 2017 for the year ended december 31 2018 tax equivalent net interest income increased 3 2 million or 9 6 to 37 0 million compared to 33 7 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the improvement in net interest income for the year to date period was largely due to growth in average earning assets and higher earning asset yields partially offset by higher funding costs average earning assets grew 100 7 million or 9 6 to 1 147 billion in 2018 from 1 046 billion in 2017 tax equivalent earning asset yields improved 29 basis points to 3 97 in 2018

in non interest income for the fourth quarter and year to date periods was primarily due to the insurance recovery net of related expenses of 6 0 million received in the fourth quarter of 2018 included in non interest income for the three months and year ended december 31 2017 were net gains on the sale of available for sale securities of 0 3 million and 1 6 million respectively

months of 2017 non interest expense for all of 2018 totaled 29 3 million an increase of 1 2 million or 4 5 from 28 1 million for 2017 the increase in non interest expense resulted largely from higher salaries and employee benefits expense related to staffing additions within fncb bank s retail and commercial lending and credit administration units coupled with increases in regulatory assessments which we believe primarily reflected strong balance sheet growth asset quality total non performing loans increased 2 1 million to 4 7 million or 0 56 of total loans at december 31 2018 from 2 6

lease losses as a percentage of gross loans was 1 13 and 1 17 at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively financial condition total assets increased 75 4 million or 6 5 to 1 238 billion at december 31

billionaires made some eye popping donations in 2018 amazon founder jeff bezos announced plans to spend us 2 billion to help the homeless and create a network of free preschools media mogul and former new york city mayor michael bloomberg pledged 1 8 billion to johns hopkins university his alma mater those were just the biggest of the nearly 800 donations of 1 million or more from very rich people over the course of the year the chronicle of philanthropy reports while it might seem ungrateful for the rest of us to do anything but cheer about boatloads of money being given away there are legitimate reasons for concern as the journalist anand giridharadas raises in his provocative new book winners take all in particular he makes a compelling argument against the increasingly dominant way of thinking about philanthropy that emphasizes the impacts that givers expect from their donations when the winners take all learning whether their giving achieves the results they want is front and center for charities and their funders as many scholars of philanthropy including me have found many of the largest givers are increasingly reporting results information on their websites and sharing what they ve learned but perhaps all the focusing on data misses a larger point giridharadas questions whether these well intentioned donors have diagnosed the problems correctly if what he calls solutions peddling is focused on the wrong thing he suggests the results they seek will inevitably fail to address the most pressing issues of our times giridharadas contends that the wealthy philanthropists and other prominent social change leaders co exist in a parallel universe he calls marketworld where the best solutions to society s problems require the same knowhow used in corporate boardrooms that is because marketworld as he sees it ignores the underlying causes for problems like poverty and hunger its virtual inhabitants do this he argues because inequality causes many of these issues and taking on inequality directly threatens the status and power of elite donors paradox of privilege winners take all is one of several recently published books raising difficult questions about how the world s biggest donors approach their giving as someone who studies teaches and believes in philanthropy i believe these writers have started an important debate that could potentially lead future donors to make make a bigger difference with their giving giridharadas to a degree echoes ford foundation president darren walker who has made a stir by denouncing a paradox of privilege that shields wealthy people from fully experiencing or acknowledging inequality even while giving us more power to do something about it like walker giridharadas finds it hard to shake the words of martin luther king jr who spoke of the circumstances of economic injustice which make philanthropy necessary to avoid changes that might endanger their privileges mega donors typically seek what they call win win solutions but however impressive the quantifiable results of those efforts may seem according to this argument those outcomes will always fall short fixes that don t threaten the powers that be leave underlying issues intact avoiding win lose solutions in giridharadas s view efforts by big funders such as the bill and melinda gates foundation and the walton family foundation to strengthen public k 12 education systems by funding charter schools look past the primary reason why not all students learn at the same pace inequality as long as school systems are funded locally based on property values students in wealthy communities will have advantages over those residing in poorer ones however creating a more equal system to pay for schools would take tax dollars and advantages away from the rich the wealthy would lose and the disadvantaged would win so it s possible to see the nearly 500 million billionaires and other rich people have pumped into charter schools and other education reform efforts over the past dozen years as a way to dodge this problem charters have surely made a difference for some kids such as those in rural oregon whose schools might otherwise have closed but since the bid to expand charters doesn t address childhood poverty or challenge the status quo aside from diluting the power of teacher unions and raising the stakes in school board elections this approach seems unlikely to help all schoolchildren indeed years into the quest to fix this problem without overhauling school funding systems most public schools in poor communities have less money than those in wealthier ones paying for tuition bloomberg s big donation raises a similar question he aims to make a johns hopkins education more accessible for promising low income students when so many hopkins alumni have enjoyed success in a wide range of careers what can be wrong with that well paying tuition challenges millions of americans not just the thousands who might attend hopkins tuition fees room and board at the top ranked school cost about 65 000 a year only 5 percent of colleges and universities were affordable according to the institute for higher education policy a nonpartisan global research and policy center for students from families earning 69 000 a year or less like giridharadas the institute argues paying for college is largely a problem of inequity bloomberg s gift will certainly help some people earn a hopkins degree but it does nothing about the bigger challenge of making college more affordable for all in a country where student debt has surpassed 1 5 trillion one alternative would be to finance advocacy for legislative remedies to address affordability and inequity for affluent donors giridharadas argues this could prove to be a nonstarter like most of what he calls win lose solutions taking that route would lead to higher taxes for the wealthy subsidies for gifts from the rich similarly who could quibble with bezos spending 2 billion to fund preschools and homeless shelters although he has not yet made clear what results he s after i have no doubt they will make a difference for countless americans no matter how he goes about it the gesture still raises questions as stanford university philanthropy scholar rob reich explains in his new book just giving the tax break rich americans get when they make charitable contributions subsidizes their favorite causes or to phrase it another way the federal government gives initiatives supported by bezos and other wealthy donors like him preferential treatment does that make sense in a democracy reich says that it doesn t the elected representatives in democracies should decide how best to solve problems with tax dollars not billionaires who are taken with one cause or another the stanford professor asserts that s why i think it s so important to ask the critical questions that giridharadas and reich are raising and why

2016 a constitutional referendum was held in bolivia the purpose was to consult about the elimination of the re election limit allowing morales to launch a presidential candidacy that could give him his fourth consecutive term however with a majority of 51 3 of the votes the decision not to carry out the constitutional reform won the referendum despite this in 2017 the constitutional court endorsed indefinite re election based on the recognition of the american convention on human rights signed by bolivia leer en español el éxito económico de bolivia la clave para la reelección de evo morales given these events there is an atmosphere of rejection of the morales government for example according to the newspaper el deber a poll of intention to vote made at the end of december 2018 puts the main opponent of the current government former president carlos mesa five points above evo morales despite this as reported by the bbc current government supporters say that the president has not begun to campaign and that when he does it will be shown that he is still the politician who can get the most votes in bolivia one point on which the electoral campaign of evo morales could be supported is the economic growth that bolivia has achieved during its three presidential terms recently the minister of economy of the government of morales mario guillén said that these 13 years bolivia has been an example in the region we are an economy that grew steadily in a sustained manner these statements are supported by those of alicia bárcena executive secretary of the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean eclac who in september 2018 said that eclac puts bolivia as an example in the region of how it can be managed very orderly macroeconomic policy and a very inclusive social policy according to the peruvian newspaper la república morales attributes the bolivian economic boom to the nationalization of bolivian hydrocarbons in 2006 making oil and gas resources the central source of the country s economy the following are some of the economic achievements of the morales government read also the other side of the 10 year challenge the venezuelan economy the rise in gdp according to world bank data bolivian nominal gdp has increased considerably since 2005 when it was at usd 9 549 million compared to the current usd 40 500 million reported by la república the same evo morales in his annual management report given on january 22 2019 highlighted the growth of 327 of bolivia s nominal gdp according to the chilean newspaper pulso during morales tenure the bolivian economy has grown by 4 9 annually which exceeds the regional average of 2 7 this growth seems to be maintained in the future since as reported by the chilean newspaper el ciudadano bolivian gdp growth of at least 4 7 is projected which is similar to that of recent years the reduction of external debt in november 2018 pablo ramos president of the central bank of bolivia bcb assured that the bolivian external debt had reached usd 9 830 billion registering the highest external debt figure in the country s history however despite this it is also noteworthy that this debt increasingly represents less of the bolivian gdp according to sources such as telesur and el ciudadano in 2005 bolivian public external debt represented 52 of nominal gdp in contrast by 2018 this debt only accounted for 24 of gdp making bolivia the seventh least indebted country in south america according to morales control of inflation and wage increase at the end of 2017 the national institute of statistics ine reported that inflation had risen by only 2 7 the lowest since 2009 when according to the central bank of bolivia there was an increase of only 0 29 during morales first presidential term surprisingly according to el ciudadano the rise in inflation during 2018 was less than in 2017 registering an increase of 1 51 despite the official prediction of 4 49 it is important to compare these figures with the salary increase that has taken place during the morales presidency if you review the supreme decrees established by the bolivian president in relation to the increase in the minimum wage since his first year as president you can see how this has gone from bs 440 in 2005 to bs 2060 marking an increase of 515 in 13 years moreover when comparing the wage increase with the annual inflation rate there have only been three years during the morales presidency in which inflation has been above the minimum wage increase 2007 2008 and 2010 in relation to the contrast between inflation and the wage increase the reduction of poverty can be highlighted samar maziad an analyst at moody s said about the bolivian economy during morales presidency that one of the surprising things is how in the last 10 years income levels have increased and poverty has been reduced to support these claims we can cite a report by pulso which states that during the presidency of morales 1 6 million people have emerged from extreme poverty according to said report in 2005 at least 38 2 of the bolivian population was in a situation of extreme poverty a figure that contrasts with 17 9 which was in that situation in 2017 according to data published by the ine in 2005 35 of the total bolivian population was part of the middle class a percentage that rose to 2017 to 58 given these data it is not surprising that in his last annual management report evo morales said that economic stability and policies to promote production have allowed inflation in bolivia to remain low maintaining the purchasing power of the population latinamerican post juan diego bogotá translated from el éxito económico de bolivia la clave para la reelección de evo morales
prime minister olli s recent address in the house attracted lots of attention of people who disagreed mainly with the part of his speech that contained information for him to boast about the progress on the economic front achieved during the last ten months or so of his governance probably buoyed by the record harvest of paddy this year which increased by 8 89 percent and the information that the economy would grow by more than 6 percent this fiscal year he completely ignored the grave problems confronting the economy surprising as well as offending many leaders from the opposition and independent observers however our head of government need not be too much criticized because in addition to the expected commendable growth of more than 6 percent which should be credited to the record paddy production there are some other positive developments such as the encouraging increase in the number of tourist arrival mainly from india and china a total of 200438 indian and 153602 chinese tourists visited nepal in 2018 registering an increase of 25 1 percent and 46 1 percent respectively in 2017 160268 indians and 104 664 chinese had visited nepal it is interesting to see hundreds of indians mostly from rural areas of up and bihar states queuing up in the pashupatinath premises to pay their respect to the lord of hindus all over the world notwithstanding some of these positive developments oli should not be unhappy with his critics who probably raised voice in the house and outside against his observations because they are aware of the ailing state of our economy after the formation of this powerful government business community had expected a better investment climate so that both domestic and foreign investment could be attracted unfortunately however government has failed to win the trust of investors which has led to a decline in investment indeed how can anyone in the current dispensation stop observers both political and apolitical from pointing that foreign investment in the country has decreased by more than half in the first few months of this fiscal year compared to the corresponding period of last fiscal year business community often accuses this government of failing to create a conducive investment environment nepal s trade deficit has widened alarmingly over time as is shown by available data in the last four months of this fiscal year merchandise trade deficit increased by 37 08 percent to reach rs 454 48 billion and export import ratio dropped to 6 1 percent from 7 4 percent in the corresponding period of last fiscal year nepal s trade deficit further widened to rs 569 50 billion in the first five months pushing the import export ratio to 16 2 1 which means nepal spent rs 16 2 on import for every rupee of export earnings drop in the share of exports is not a recent phenomenon because little more than a decade ago people got concerned that the share of export in total trade dropped to 13 percent which has deteriorated to the current very disappointing level export import ratio has declined to 6 2 percent in the five months of this fiscal year from 7 5 percent in the five months of the last fiscal year the ratio in the five months of 2016 17 stood at 8 percent oli led dispensation however cannot be solely blamed for this unchecked deterioration over time in the external sector of the economy but any attempt by the concerned to veil the reality are bound to be strongly resisted as has been the case after oli s address in the house this trade imbalance has caused balance of payment bop to remain negative rs 85 32 billion in these months of this fiscal year despite robust growth 31 9 percent in the workers remittances in the current five months as against its decline of 0 8 percent in the corresponding period of last fiscal year the current account deficit in the five months of this year has reached rs 119 33 billion as against rs 64 11 billion deficit in the corresponding period of last fiscal year moreover government s inability to spend the allocated expenditures is also often cited as an example of ineffective governance it may be noted that in the six months of this fiscal year total budgetary expenditure recurrent capital and fiscal management combined has reached only 28 57 percent of the total budgetary outlay of rs 1315 billion and the state of capital expenditure has remained pathetic at 17 68 percent which has resulted in rs 152 billion of government s money lying idle at the central bank ministry of finance people may boast that in the six months of this fiscal year revenue collection has gone up by 25 5 percent compared to the corresponding period of last year but nepali congress leaders like dr mahat may wish to take resort to some figures to communicate that revenue collection has fallen short of the target in the six months further how can nc leader and parliamentarian gagan thapa be stopped from stating in the house and outside that revenue collection could meet only 93 5 percent of the target which aims at registering an increase of 35 percent over the collection of last fiscal year it may also be mentioned that revenue collection last fiscal year had fallen short of the target for the first time in a decade in the meanwhile there is no dearth of people who see not much sense in giving too much emphasis to revenue collection when about rs 152 billion of government money is lying idle at the central bank and cost of borrowing from financial institutions has gone up sharply on account of liquidity crunch that the market has been experiencing since long it is also perplexing that the two government agencies central bank and the comptroller general s office have come up with conflicting data on revenue collection the difference seen being as high as rs 100 billion all said and done it would be unwise to belittle the progress achieved on the revenue collection front despite strong chances of it falling short of the ambitious target one more time in keeping with the global trend consumer price inflation has moderated both in nepal and india drop in commodity and fuel prices have contributed towards drop in the level of inflation in many countries the ongoing trade war between china and india and a relatively weak growth of chinese economy in 2018 is likely to further complicate the situation globally the recently held trade talk between china and usa in bejing and the one to be held in washington d c soon is likely to find a solution because both sides which have burnt their fingers indulging in this row look anxious to end the crisis those in government must have also realized that foreign exchange reserve with the central bank is also on a decline for example the gross foreign exchange reserve was rs 1065 80 billion as at mid december 2018 which decreased to rs 1102 59 billion as at mid july registering a decrease of 3 3 percent oli led government is also accused of not being able to do anything about hundreds of millions of demonetized 1000 and 500 denomination indian rupees still awaiting exchange a recent cabinet decision banning circulation of indian banknotes of all denominations above 100 surprised people especially those not aware of the fact that the reserve bank of india rbi has not taken any step till date to formalize the use and circulation of the new indian banknotes in nepal through the foreign exchange management act fema which prompted our central bank recently to request the rbi that necessary arrangements be made to allow the use of new denomination indian banknotes our monetary authority has also sought exchange facility for the demonetized notes it is learnt that the central bank holds 700 million indian rupees in 500 and 1000 rupee denominations in addition to this general public and business concerns could be possessing huge sum in demonetized notes it may also be noted that only 100 rupee indian banknotes have been covered by an earlier fema notification which means foreign nationals including nepalis are not allowed to carry other denomination notes this has created problems for businesses relying on indian tourists people leaving in border areas and our central bank which has to bring in indian currency to meet demand for it in nepal hope the new initiative urging of our central bank would succeed in getting favourable response of the rbi to clear the indian banknote related lock jam so that in addition to immense benefit to the people those in government would also have some kind of a concrete achievement to talk about in future discourses the concerned at rbi may also note that positive action on this issue would increase the faith also of non indians in indian currency the acceptability of which as a major currency is increasing not only in south asian countries but elsewhere too in addition to these matters related to the economy the current dispensation is also confronted with multitude of problems of varying nature and magnitude in other areas the eight day long mahasamiti meeting of nepali congress nc which endorsed a 15 point proposal on contemporary issues accused the government of trying to undermine the role of the main opposition party in the name of two thirds majority in the parliament and vowed to check the authoritarian ambition of the government it also came down heavily on the government over a function allegedly organized to promote one particular religion by a controversial organization with active participation support and protection of the government the conspicuous presence and active participation of the top leaders of the ruling communist party including prime minister oli who also received a huge sum as cash reward made many people unhappy and drew sharp criticism not only from the main opposition party nc but the ruling party some leaders of which have demanded that leaders like oli and senior leader nepal apologize publicly for the wrongdoing nc and some prominent leaders of the ruling party have separately denounced such an activity and have warned the government not to repeat such things it is interesting that while a few communist leaders have been accused by their own part men and others of working in favour of christianity nc leaders have begun to exert pressure on their leaders to support hinduism as a national religion although the nc leadership succeeded in stopping the religion related proposal from taking a formal shape in the mahasamiti meeting it would be very difficult to permanently put to rest this proposal moved by an overwhelming majority of mahasamiti members of nc desperately in need of fresh slogans and agendas to stop further erosion in it this article has simply made an attempt to put facts on our economy before the concerned our prime minister would do well by stopping himself and his colleagues from painting a rosy picture of the economy at a time when trade imbalance is on the rise balance of payment is negative current account is in deficit foreign exchange reserve is decreasing and foreign investment has registered a sharp decline opposition leaders should also not be too hard on oli because the mess that the economy is in today cannot be solely blamed on the still young government led by him
haarp the high frequency active auroral research program was initiated as an ionospheric research program established in 1993 in gakona alaska and operated by the university of alaska fairbanks it was and is funded by the u s air force the u s navy the university of alaska fairbanks and the defense advanced research projects agency darpa its alleged purpose was to analyze the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance haarp is a high power high frequency transmitter used for study of the ionosphere that is the official version haarp was supposed to be shut down in may 2014 but then it was decided that the facility would be transferred to the university of alaska in reality this sophisticated research project owned by the military and most probably with cia hands in it is continuing in some secret location working on ionospheric enhancement technologies to be used to influence weather patterns in fact to weaponize weather the first known occasion when the us air force used high power high frequency transmitters was to influence the intensity and duration of the monsoon during the vietnam war in the 1960s the idea was to render the transition of the vietcong from north to south vietnam on their jungle paths more difficult or impossible through extended heavy rains to what extent this attempt was successful is not known however since then research has evolved and it is now possible to influence weather patterns throughout the world in other words to create droughts floods storm hurricanes wherever such weather phenomena are convenient for the purposes of empire and its vassals talk about man made climate change imagine the amount of money that can be generated by such unsuspicious weather modifications let alone the amount of human suffering famine despair chaos economic collapse eventually entire segments of populations can be wiped out and all will be attributed to climate change which are claimed to be man made due to our civilization s excessive co2 emissions man made indeed extensive and prolonged changes in weather patterns can have devastating economic impacts the pampas stretching over some 750 000 km2 is one of south america s most fertile region covering argentina s norther tier from the atlantic to the andes and also all of uruguay and part of southern brazil the area was struck in 2017 2018 by one of the harshest droughts in the last 10 years severely curtailing argentina s main staple wheat corn soybean and beef argentina is the world s third largest exporter of soybean and corn argentina was counting on record agricultural yields that would contribute significantly to the expected 3 5 gdp growth in 2018 instead 2018 agricultural exports are expected to be reduced by some us 3 5 billion this is expected to result in a cut of gdp growth by at least 1 to 1 5 not counting agriculture related industries that will suffer losses many of which may have to close and thereby also increasing unemployment and human misery the neoliberal mauricio macri who came to power in december 2015 as an implant by washington has already devastated the country by drastic austerity programs combined with severe tariff increases for public and social services i e transportation electricity fuel water supply as well as health and education the country is in shambles with an unemployment rate officially hovering around 10 but in reality it is more like 20 to 25 the poverty rate increased under macri s dictatorship to about 35 from about 15 in november 2015 before macri came to power strikes and social protests abound there is not one week without social unrest which drives the country further into the ground like the yellow vest in france who want to oust president macron argentinians want to get rid of macri in comes the imf which has recently published a devastating report about argentina s state of the economy it predicts a grim scenario with rising interest rates on argentina s mostly dollar denominated debt triggering local money production and a predicted inflation of 40 a continuous loss of purchasing power hurting especially the poor and average income earners prompting more social unrest a vicious downward spiral in june 2018 the imf invited by macri to the rescue followed its usual recipe of more debt and more austerity the scenario looks pretty similar to what happened in 2010 2011 and forward in greece just on a much larger scale at least by a factor of 5 over a 3 year period in argentina the imf agreed to a standby credit of us 50 billion the largest in the imf s history with a tranche of us 15 billion to be drawn immediately however in september 2018 the peso crashed under the burden of debt and inflation and argentina faced insolvency no problem the imf came to the rescue with an additional us 13 4 billion bringing the total for 2018 to us 28 3 billion greece s first bailout tranche in 2010 which was 20 billion us 22 6 billion at today s exchange rate that the imf repeats greek mistake in argentina is of course a joke this is not a mistake this is calculated greed administered to the people of argentina usurpation at its worst argentina is a much larger and richer country much more almost infinitely more can be extracted from her economy than from greece s and argentina has been primed by a complacent president put in place by those financial oligarchs intent to milk argentina to the bones would it therefore be surprising if the argentine economic disaster and consequently the imf rescue action was helped a bit by climate change à la haarp peter koenig is an economist and geopolitical analyst he is also a water resources and environmental specialist he

this article is more than 5 years old freopp org for decades we ve talked and talked and talked about the high cost of american health care but we haven t done anything about it as the above chart shows the problem has gotten so bad that today hospital spending reduces the average family s take home pay more than do federal taxes overall as a country americans spent 1 2 trillion on hospital care in 2018 that s over 3 600 for every man woman and child in the u s the centers for medicare and medicaid services project that by 2026 hospital spending will rise to 1 8 trillion over 5 300 per person according to the census the average american household consisted of about 2 5 people which means that the average family s share of u s hospital spending in 2018 was about 9 200 nearly 15 percent of the median household income of 62 454 that s a lot of money but what makes it even more remarkable is that it s more than the average family pays in federal taxes the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 cut the federal tax rate for a family of median income from 14 6 percent to 13 8 percent that includes income taxes payroll taxes and every other federal tax that applies to middle class families that is to say the average family now hands over more of its paycheck to the hospital industry than it does to the federal government in taxes and as the chart shows it s only going to get worse over time hospital spending continues to rise faster than inflation but barring further changes to tax law the federal tax rate for the median family will remain just under 14 percent digging beneath the numbers i know this is a numbers oriented post in general but skip this next section if too many numbers make your eyes glaze over in certain ways the above chart underestimates the difference between hospital spending by the median household and the median household s tax rate after all a good chunk of the average family s tax bill pays for hospital spending in public programs like medicare medicaid and obamacare for example every worker pays a 2 9 percent payroll tax to funds medicare s hospital program employers pay half of that for w 2 workers though ultimately it comes out of workers pockets on top of that of the 1 7 trillion irs collects in income taxes about a quarter goes to pay for hospital spending in public programs in other words if we subtracted out the portion of the average family s taxes that were spent on hospital care in public programs the blue points in the above chart would be lower the orange points should also be slightly lower because the value of employer sponsored health insurance isn t counted as household income in official government statistics hence the true percentage of household income inclusive of the value of employer sponsored insurance spent on hospital care should be lower than 14 7 percent the above chart also doesn t take into account the value of public spending on hospital care for the median family for example households with a family member over 65 get much of their hospital care paid for by medicare those with employer sponsored health insurance get a tax subsidy because the value of that insurance isn t counted towards income as discussed above on the flip side those with private health insurance are paying far more for hospital care than those with government based coverage because hospitals have taken advantage of their superior market power to charge more to the privately insured and uninsured could single payer solve this problem when i first posted this chart on twitter many twitterers saw it as a case for single payer health care and it s true that a robust single payer program with strict price controls and rationing of care could reduce hospital spending by regulating the prices that hospitals charge but it remains to be seen whether or not a single payer plan that democrats could actually pass would contain such features the hospital lobby is extremely politically powerful because the local hospital is one of the largest employers in every congressional district the new democratic house has not talked a lot about tackling high hospital prices preferring instead to train their fire on prescription drug prices an important problem but a smaller one relative to hospital prices an opportunity for real reform the best and least disruptive way to reduce the high cost of hospital care in america is to increase competition for hospital services hospitals have been merging with each other for decades as a result in many parts of the country a single hospital mega system has a virtual monopoly and takes advantage of its market power to charge exploitative prices to the privately insured and uninsured at my think tank the foundation for research on equal opportunity i recently put out a detailed plan to tackle the problem of hospital consolidation its key feature is to eliminate the ability of local hospital monopolies to charge exploitative prices by precluding them from charging the privately insured and uninsured more than they charge medicare hospital monopolies would remain free to charge less i m glad to report that a new bill the hospital competition act of 2019 introduced by indiana rep jim banks reflects many of these concepts members of congress who want to do more than talk about the high cost of american health care would do well

executive officer christopher maher christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer thank you jill and good morning to all who have been able to join our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call today this morning i m joined by our chief operating officer joe lebel and chief financial officer mike fitzpatrick as always we appreciate your interest in our performance and are pleased to be able to discuss our operating results with you as has been our practice we will highlight a few key items and add some color to the results posted for the quarter and then we look forward to taking your questions in terms of financial results for the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were 0 55 quarterly reported earnings were impacted by merger related expenses branch consolidation charges and a non core favorable income tax item these items net of tax benefit provides 696 000 of non core net income representing about 0 01 a share excluding those amounts core earnings per share were 0 54 a respectable 20 increase over the fourth quarter of 2017 regarding capital management for the quarter the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 17 the company s 88th consecutive quarterly cash dividend the 0 17 dividend represents a 31 payout of core earnings which will allow us to build capital levels as we pursue a variety of opportunities to deploy that capital in growth initiatives the volatility in equity markets provide the opportunity to repurchase shares during the quarter the company repurchased 459 251 shares at a weighted average price of 23 60 per share there were 1 3 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase program at current prices you could expect the company to be an active repurchaser of shares in the coming months performance metrics for the quarter reflect the progress made over the past year from a profitability perspective the company achieved record core earnings of 94 1 million or 1 98 per share the best in our history our fourth quarter run rate evidenced a core return on assets of 1 38 and a core return on tangible common equity of 15 19 which reflects the work we have done to improve relative profitability we achieved these results by managing our margins which expanded over the year and by aggressively reducing operating expenses as we integrated the sun bank operation and consolidated 17 retail branches over the course of the year from a balance sheet perspective we strengthen the company s risk profile by several key measures the company maintained a prudent interest rate risk position as evidenced by our 3 68 net interest rate margin for the fourth quarter preserved a strong liquidity position with a loan to deposit ratio of 96 build tangible book value per share which increased 5 increased the tangible common equity ratio by 113 basis points to 9 55 and reduced total non performing assets to just 18 8 million or 25 basis points of total assets less than half the level of year end 2017 collectively these efforts have been engineered to prepare our balance sheet to weather a wide variety of risks that may develop in the quarters and years ahead while developing our core business we ve continued to take advantage of opportunities as they arise including the recent agreement to acquire capital bank the capital acquisition is proceeding smoothly with regulatory approval secured on december 19 just 27 business days following our application earlier this week capital shareholders approved the transaction which is now expected to close on january 31st of 2019 the capital integration and accompanying branch consolidation is scheduled to be completed late in the second quarter of this year capital improves our deposit market share in cumberland and atlantic counties to 33 and 24 respectively it will positively impact earnings in the second half of the year capital s maintained an asset sensitive commercial bank balance sheet with a conservative loan to deposit ratio of 67 modest 51 basis point cost of deposits and a stand alone roa of over 1 25 not only does the franchise nicely complement existing oceanfirst business but their financial performance will improve our performance metrics especially after the integration is completed bear in mind however that the additional shares to be issued in connection with the capital bank transaction closing may provide a core eps headwind of about 0 01 to 0 02 per quarter until the full integration in june of this year also the board of directors announced their decision to appoint grace vallacchi executive vice president and chief risk officer of the company and the bank to the boards of directors of both the company in the bank effective immediately grace will retain her executive vice president and chief risk officer positions as well as her role in the executive management team and report directly to me grace joined oceanfirst in september of 2017 and was previously an associate deputy comptroller in the northeastern district of the office of the comptroller of the currency with her experience and insight grace has made a positive impact on our company and i know her contributions as a director will be a valuable addition to our board as we look toward performance throughout 2019 we are squarely focused on two important initiatives the first will be efforts to further improve efficiencies through the deployment of technology and the consolidation of at least four additional legacy oceanfirst branches the second will be an effort to improve the consistency of our loan growth as major integrations are behind us the recruitment of seasoned commercial bankers will become a primary objective as we expand our commercial lending presence into both the new york and philadelphia metropolitan areas joe lebel will walk you through some additional detail regarding our performance for the quarter and his plans to build out the business throughout 2019 at this point i ll turn the call over to joe after joe s discussion we ll be happy to take your questions joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks chris commercial loan originations were strong in the quarter as expected with closings in excess of 151 million overall loan production of 260 million represented a very solid quarter more importantly yields on the new originations exceeded 5 with improvements in all lending areas overall loan growth was muted but positive at 36 6 million as new loan originations and the purchase of a 49 5 million pool of student loans similar to earlier purchases this year offset several payoffs from credits not meeting our credit disciplines or pricing guidelines since the sun acquisition is nearing its one year anniversary we have touched many of the credits in some fashion and fully expect attrition from our review to abate similar to other acquisitions we ve made i d like to update you on the talent acquisition strategies as the successful integration of sun is behind us we focused our efforts on the continued expansion of our commercial banking business by identifying senior leadership in geographic markets and building lending teams around them we ve added several new lenders in philadelphia in the past few months and expect to expand our presence in new york city in the first quarter as well we ve also created a syndication desk to focus on the purchase of loans that meet our conservative credit appetite while we have not changed our credit disciplines we believe our increased scale can lead to thoughtful conservative balance sheet growth in existing and adjacent markets without undue risk while these transactions maybe a thinner overall margins the value and consistent loan growth with reasonable expense levels provides a modest complement to our core lending business and will have a positive effect on overall profitability turning to the interest margin our nim of 3 68 represents a 4 basis point increase quarter to quarter largely attributable to better execution on originations purchase accounting in the margin declined 1 basis point from 24 basis points to 23 basis points during the quarter the resulting core nim increased to 3 45 up 5 basis points yield on earning assets improved by 9 basis points to 4 31 our expectation on the nim remains at or close to current levels with any impact from deposit repricing and reduction from purchase accounting offset by continued modest gains in the loan portfolio looking at the positive trends we saw a decrease of approximately 40 million due to seasonal government attrition and tempered seasonal business activity further attrition from acquired banks cd and money market accounts is slowing as expected and we expect first quarter government balances to increase due to their quarterly tax collections deposit retention for the acquired banks has exceeded our expectations despite the fierce competition for deposits in our markets in that vein our cost of deposits rose to 48 basis points from 39 basis points as we proactively reprice selected corporate cash management client accounts while costs will increase from these proactive actions in q1 we don t expect significant repricing to occur the quarterly deposit beta was 36 and the year ended at 16 as our funding profile continues as one of the best in our state a brief comment on expenses for the quarter while we held the line on operating expenses we did not achieve our internal targets and remain committed to continued progress our goal of achieving an efficiency ratio nearing 50 by fiscal year end 2019 remains in place as chris noted continued branch rationalization and consolidation will occur outside the capital bank acquisition these actions to proactively manage operating expenses in combination with the loan growth initiatives i outlined earlier are targeted to both further improve our efficiency ratio and contribute to eps growth throughout the year with that we ll move on to the q a part of the call questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instruction first question comes from frank schiraldi with sandler o neill please go ahead with your question frank schiraldi sandler o neill partners lp analyst good morning christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer good morning frank frank schiraldi sandler o neill partners lp analyst just on as you guys talk about philly and new york as you talk about new york is that sort of the can you give little more color there is that sort of the outer boroughs what sort of lending are you looking at and is this is the idea to open an lpo with something that might eventually lead to branches just some further color there thanks christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer sure we have limited coverage in new york already we have one commercial lender located in manhattan they came to us through sun so it s not a new market for us per se it s also a market that i have a significant background in as does joe lebel so we ve been watching and waiting for the right opportunity to start adding resources up there so i d characterize this we ve identified a couple of hires that we intend to make hopefully that d be concluded by the end of the first quarter and these are seasoned folks that are well known to us that we think can be pretty productive in terms of what we re looking at there it would be throughout the boroughs and as well as manhattan and it would be a mix of c i and cre but to be realistic the c i making progress in c i takes a longer period of time so i would expect that we re going to see relationship real estate lending meaning some owner occupied properties some investor properties we ve been waiting for the right opportunity to use some of our capacity in the balance sheet add some of those properties we ve looked at loan pools over the past probably couple of years and decided that we d rather go in and do it through a direct origination platform so it ll be a commercial loan origination office it will be several people there ll be known producers and we look forward to giving you more color on that so that s in progress i think we ll have that in the first half of the year established and then grow it from that point similar situation in philadelphia although we re little bit earlier in the process in philadelphia so we ve been covering that market more thoroughly probably starting the second half of 2018 and have made a number of recent hires and we have a number of folks in the pipeline for that so in both places we re hiring the teams first and then we ll establish a physical location but i think in both areas we see an opportunity now as joe mentioned the loans that are going into the book today are yielding over 5 so we think the pricing is back where it should be and we think by entering those markets we can get selective relationship transactions that will be added to the balance sheet so i m going to ask joe to just make a comment or two about the hires he has made to date and what he has been selected joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer frank it s continued path down the road of seasoned lenders from national regional banks that have been through cycles that have big followings in books of business and we ve continued that we had the loan production offices in newtown square and now we ve hired two more folks that will be in central philadelphia and hopefully on our way for a third and continue to recruit in this space frank schiraldi sandler o neill partners lp analyst and as you think about growth into philly and new york just curious how are you thinking about net loan growth net organic growth in general and what are you thinking about in terms of net growth in new jersey at this point christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer sure so if you think about how we ve guided in the past saying that we d like to have say somewhere in the range of 50 million to 100 million of loan growth number one we d like to be much more consistent about that we recognized over the last couple of quarters albeit due to pay offs and somethings like that we ve had less consistency in the net growth numbers so we want to be more consistent so i think we need to supplement what we re doing in new jersey and then the second thing is i would look at this as being largely a second half of the year event you ll see maybe some impacts in the first or second quarter but it s really going to be a second half event i think that we could be then at that point have the productive capacity to be looking more toward the higher end of that range so maybe we can begin to target more of the 100 million plus per quarter in loan growth so this is not something that will change overnight but we were waiting we did not want to enter either of these markets in a small way or kind of as a hobby we wanted to make sure we re getting high quality staff that staff comes with it s expensive staff appropriately so but we think it s the right time the last thing i d say about that is to be credible to the folks that you re hiring in those markets you want to make sure you ve got everything aligned internally so having finished we wanted to get through the sun transition we had to be able to demonstrate that we ve got all engines firing with a great support team that we would be able to support from a credit infrastructure perspective adding those kinds of producers frank schiraldi sandler o neill partners lp analyst okay and then just finally if i could i mean obviously you talked joe you talked about the expenses and the expense base is a bit higher i think than people were looking for it sounds to me like these weren t sort of you called out a few categories in the release but is it fair to say these weren t sort of one off this is sort of the operating expense base and then to get to your goals you re looking for further branch rationalization to get there does that is that fair michael j fitzpatrick executive vice president chief financial officer yeah they re mostly frank it s mike it s primarily recurring expenses although the i can see equipment for example is higher than we expected we re holding a dozen properties for sale so those correspond while we wrote those properties down to market value the operating cost associated with taxes and maintenance are recurring expense so we have an opportunity to exit those 12 branches and reduce expenses that way that s taken a little bit longer than we had thought and some of the professional fees are up a little bit that tended to be a little bit lumpy we did have higher legal and consulting and accounting professionals in the fourth quarter especially with all the tax issues that s going on in new jersey with the new jersey and the federal taxation so just a little bit of lumpiness in that line that might not recur but yes we would and going forward you will see when we start with the new year now we do have compensation increases for our staff that take effect at the beginning of the year so we ll grow into that over the course of the year so looking forward we ll see the expenses rise little bit above these levels frank schiraldi sandler o neill partners lp analyst all right thank you christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer thanks frank operator and the next question comes from david bishop with fig partners please go ahead with your question david bishop fig partners llc analyst hey good morning guys christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer good morning david joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer good morning david bishop fig partners llc analyst chris you spoke about some of the headwinds in terms of the originations but may have been impacted by continued pay off of some loans you re looking to exit just curious i don t know if you have the number in front of you but do you have a sense what the exit of those credits how much of a headwind that was in aggregate for the year and what gives you confidence or do you have confidence that the majority of that is behind you as you enter into 2019 christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer i d give you an order of magnitude and then joe may have some comments on the types of things that we allowed to kind of move on there was about just in december we had about 47 million worth of pay offs but much of that was the kind of stuff you would expect to pay off joe can walk you through a couple of examples i think what we re recognizing is that on the size of this balance sheet now we need to have a little more productive capacity and we wanted to be careful not to try and draw that out of the core markets that we feel we ve already got covered pretty well so i ll just say we win every deal in our market but i think we are winning a lot of the deals who want to be in our market so stretching the markets a little bit provides us a vast pool both in philly and new york so to just put on a little bit of production in each one of those and make sure that these pay offs which are probably a way of life for the next year two that we can overcome them and still continue still find a way to do very consistent loan growth so joe maybe a little color on the loans that we kind of let go we could have in some cases stayed in joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer i think it s a couple of things dave one is we ve gone through this before we tend to take a fairly strict approach to the acquired banks loans and make decisions on credit and structure and pricing so we do have some of that runoff i think we mentioned this in the third quarter it was like 75 million and i don t know what the actual number related just the sun would have been in the fourth quarter but as chris mentioned about 47 million in payoffs just in december but three of those loans were the type of loans that should pay off when they due 9 million construction loan that s converting to an insurance company led permanent and 11 million land loan that was on the books for two years as agreed and paid off from construction refinance so those types of things are expected along with on occasion the acquired bank portfolios but typically we ve seen the acquired bank portfolios runoff be exacerbated in year one as we touch these credits and make decisions and then slowdown in years two and three as the folks that remain are acclimated to us where you re comfortable with them so i expect some of that runoff to abate in 2019 david bishop fig partners llc analyst just curious as sort of like inaudible crystal ball you had look back in terms of the sun acquisition in terms of the way these loans have trended and paid down any surprises from that perspective or does this change how you maybe approach how you re handling the capital bank portfolio versus the future acquisitions and scrubbing their loan portfolio christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer it s a good question so a few factors here the first is that the sun loans had on average had a larger average balance so what we might have i think maybe modeled better is that in larger dollar loans as they come up for renewal the competition is more heated and in many cases it was a competitive decision where there were elements like structural elements like more cash out where we had a relationship because stayed in the loan but the guy can get a lot more dollars than we d be willing to do somewhere else and that s going to happen if you got a 15 million 20 million 30 million loan so i think we ve been thoughtful about that overall we re very pleased with where sun is tracking we ve got some other positives in things like the cost of deposits and the operating expenses kind of played out well as we then translate that into capital to answer the second part of your question our capital is a much more granular portfolio so a lot smaller average loan balance and i think that we re going to have less of an issue related to the prepaid levels on a percentage basis and then of course capital is much smaller than sun sun was about 1 8 billion portfolio actually 1 6 billion portfolio sorry and we ve got a fraction of that in capital so it really won t present the headwind david bishop fig partners llc analyst got it and then one follow up in terms of the quarterly losses in terms of the your favorite banquet hall facility that s now in the past should we expect that drag in terms of the fee income line the 837 000 loss on real estate operations to basically go away or just be immaterial amount christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer that is correct this is the primary motivations we never wanted to be in that business and we re glad to be out of it but i will say i m glad that we handled that the way we did it was a significant employer in a local community where we do a lot of business we thank the municipality we thank a lot of people in that area and we were able to make a difference not a big financial impact to us michael j fitzpatrick executive vice president chief financial officer and dave out of that 800 000 600 000 was directly related to the property that we sold so there s always going to be a little bit of recurring cost for other oreo that comes on and off our books david bishop fig partners llc analyst got it thanks mike operator and the next question comes from russell gunther with davidson please go ahead with your question russell gunther d a davidson co analyst hey good morning guys christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer good morning russell russell gunther d a davidson co analyst i wanted to circle back to the loan growth conversation appreciate the color about your plans for 2019 and the strategy there as we think about the back half of the year and that 100 million target how should we think about the mix of that growth consumer and resi re has been pretty strong of late but as we look toward the back half of last year with the commercial initiatives you talked about how would that mix change if at all christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think that you should think about our residential and consumer line at a very slow trends like it has been in the past it will not accelerate we re not looking to put a lot more in the balance sheet there that s a nice risk mitigant for us it s a great product for our customers and it is a product that we find to be profitable in our model that we ve funded with long term core deposits so the incremental growth to the extent we re able to do it would be in the commercial lines and it would be a combination of investor cre owner occupied cre and c i with the waiting in the real estate categories the we love c i we re trying to push that all the time but we also recognize that there is a lot of appetite for c i out there and it s probably one of those asset classes you got to be most careful about now because new entries are coming into the market that may not have the historical context the credit discipline to in some cases it s pricing in some cases it s structure but there is some c i relationships out there that while we love to have them but we can t have them on the terms that they re available to us russell gunther d a davidson co analyst got it okay great and then just circling back to the margin comment expecting the margin to remain in a range around current levels are you thinking about that relative to the 3 68 this quarter and if you could share with us what you re baking in there from any expectations for the fed to raise rates and also if you could comment what you d expect from the margin were the fed to be on pause going forward christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer sure so we have a relatively balanced position from an interest rate risk standpoint the 3 68 is kind of where we say we ll bounce around that number going forward we continue to have and the rate of balance sheet is growing today which is not much the rotation of fed increases get passed through to our floating rate loans and they impact our deposits a little bit and the net is we re a little better off at the end of the day so the accretion is related to purchase accounting is rolling off and the natural nim is coming up in the event in the back half of the year we were able to significantly increase the growth rate and hit those 100 million numbers that s an opportunity potentially to drive the margin a little better because we still think funding is in very good shape we re not seeing we don t have any concerns about our funding base so we re able to hold funding where it is we have a little bit of excess deposit capacity in balance sheet today as we fold capital in their loan to deposit ratio of 67 gives us more capacity and then of course we think we can actually grow deposits if we need to if we ve got good loans to put them in so back half of the year if loan growth picks up i think you could see little upside in the nim but absent that i think we re pretty steady and the situation doesn t change much whether there is fed hikes or not if the fed hikes come we pass them through on our floating rate loans our deposits go up a little bit and it s about neutral and if the fed rate doesn t come and both of those things don t happen and wind up again pretty neutral russell gunther d a davidson co analyst got it okay great color there thank you and then last one from me would be any update mike on the tax rate outlook for 2019 and 2020 michael j fitzpatrick executive vice president chief financial officer it would be as we ve said in the past 19 would be our expected rate russell gunther d a davidson co analyst thanks guys for taking my questions christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer all right thanks russell operator and the next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw please go ahead with your question collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst thanks good morning guys just curious joe how many commercial lenders do you guys currently have joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer we re over 20 at the moment and every day it seems that i m adding lenders and of course so i think that s a great thing for us and as we expand the geography further into philadelphia and then eventually new york city i expect that number to continue to rise every quarter collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst and i guess that was going to be my next question kind of where do you see that your team of lenders sort of leveling out or how are you kind of thinking about the staffing outlook here joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer we like to say internally that every year when we budget for staff that we have a budget for every position except for lenders commercial lenders so if we find good commercial lenders we ll hire them what we ve also done and we hold our folks accountable we also look at those performance issues when we have them and so we re constantly calling through the staff and making sure that we re optimally structured based on performance so i don t know collyn i would tell you that we tend to try to focus on hiring one to two strong lenders every quarter i think we ll probably over the last two months we ve hired a few i think we ll probably may outpace that in the first quarter of 2019 collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay so i was just trying to gauge so the comments with the focus on building out philadelphia as well as new york city so it s not like you re going to meaningfully scale your team of lenders it s more just having your current folks give them a little bit more latitude to start to grow their portfolios or just trying to think multiple speakers joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah it s a little bit more nuanced than that in the past i would tell you as we ve grown the company we ve tried to focus on adding a lender or two in geographies we ve gotten enough scale in certain geographies now where the approach needs to be a little bit more top down to try to hire us a team leader or someone of even higher significance so the regional president role comes to mind because we re geographically structured as a company and then having those folks that are known in those markets especially philadelphia and new york drive the recruitment activity collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay that s helpful and then just thinking about chris the idea here that kind of expanding your wings a little bit into the new york city geographies or geographies maybe where there s a little bit better growth prospects than your legacy market how do you think about m a i mean it seems like this would be a great opportunity for you to even accelerate m a or even do larger deals or i mean you just seem to be in a pretty good spot from that standpoint how are you thinking about that any differently as you move into these sort of higher growth markets christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer we would look i would use the like the capital example where that might have been a little bit smaller than something we would like to find it checked all boxes and i think we showed we ll close that we ll go from announcement to close in roughly 90 days on that so i think we ve gotten pretty good at taking the risk out of acquisitions integrating them hitting our expense targets and then also adding both customer bases as well as lenders as part of that so we have our eyes open i think we have the opportunity we have that s one of the reasons that we are choosing to keep little more capital on the balance sheet right letting our tce ratio drift up gives us the opportunity if we wanted to find something interesting we d go ahead and do that that said it s an interesting time in m a because you do have a few people that i think would be heavily interested in finding a partner but typically many of those have a balance sheet issue right it could be an interest rate issue it could be something like that and that doesn t necessarily advance our business so although it may be viable it may not advance the business so it has to be the right thing the other thing i think comes into m a is the mentality around price expectations and it s very hard probably for ceos but especially for boards to say hey you know i m going to accept a price today that may be 20 lower than i was trading at eight months ago but the reality is that s probably the right price for the company today but it s a really hard thing for people emotionally to let go of what my value was four months or five months ago so i think we ve got the capacity to do it i think we ve got the team to do it i think we re demonstrating that as we do things like capital as quickly and efficiently as we have but the circumstances have to be right the right franchise and pricing has to be right if you think about our currency our currency is not valued at what it was 60 days ago i know it s an industry issue as well but we have to be thoughtful about if i m going to print the share for something i better print the share that s really going to pay back my shareholders so i think we re open to it we love that opportunity but we re also realistic that if that doesn t happen we think we can make real progress organically and on the organic side i d add we re making a small number of hires in philadelphia and new york to establish our beachheads to get comfortable with that these are markets that we both know from having worked in and in case of philadelphia having studied pretty hard over the last couple of years we wanted to be thoughtful about when we enter we re seeing loan rates at a point where we think the incremental expansion of our balance sheet makes sense so stage 1 is establishing our presence there once we have a presence there as joe pointed out and this is i think really critical we re looking at this saying we want to attract the leaders in these geographies that will then do that additional hiring under their wing in 2019 i think we ve been kind of reasonably conservative about what our expectations are if you play this forward into 2020 and 2021 each of those geographies individually have the opportunity to add a tremendous amount of growth to our balance sheet so i think we have access to markets that we re going to start to take advantage of collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay that s very helpful and then just lastly on the buyback what are some of the thresholds that will determine kind of how aggressive or not aggressive you ll be on the buyback going forward christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer so we look at the buyback of our own shares a lot like we look at the an acquisition or the purchase of somebody else s company so tangible book dilution is really important to us and earn back periods are important to us so if you were to look at kind of the earnings trajectory we re on and the price of the stock today and i would imagine if a lot of smart people put their models together their model would look a lot like ours in terms of earn back horizons and we typically get pretty conservative as earn backs at the five year mark now i would say as opposed to an acquisition where we look for earn backs to be in the three year mark with us we know we re buying we re buying ourselves so we would stretch out a little bit further i would note that the buybacks that occurred in the fourth quarter were limited due to dependency of the capital bank shareholder vote which prevented us from making additional share repurchases during that so as we go forward with that being behind us and we get into the further into the quarter and window opens up for us we have the opportunity to maybe do some more meaningful buybacks collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay that s helpful i ll leave it there thanks guys christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator operator instructions and our next question comes from erik zwick with boenning scattergood please go ahead with your question mr zwick your line is live erik zwick boenning scattergood inc analyst can you hear me now christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer yes we can sorry hey erik erik zwick boenning scattergood inc analyst great good morning everyone first just a question about your comments about creating a loan syndication desk can you just provide a little color maybe on your decision to create this desk maybe how many people it will involve and whether you re sourcing them internally or externally christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer sure so not surprising given the growth of the company our participations both bought and sold have tended to be an effort that s risen out of our line commercial lenders and maybe peer to peer relationships we have with a couple of banks but we didn t have an established place in the bank it was the sole owner for all of this business and any decisions we would make so they d run through the normal credit processes and go through credit committee and we d kind of make a decision on a one off basis our book is not giant today it s only a couple of hundred million we don t think we re going to change that dramatically but we do think that given the number of participations we have and the way the process works for us you would expect the more mature commercial bank to have a lead person in a process and a desk and everything flow through that so i think there s the opportunity for a little bit of growth there but i would be careful to signal this is not a giant effort and it s not going to add a lot of dollars to the balance sheet so we have one professional who s got a deep background in this who s been doing this kind of work for 30 years he joined us just a couple of weeks ago and he will be able to both strengthen the existing participations function that we have today and allow us to do some business that as we re better organized we might be able to do more of so i wouldn t look at this and say it s going to be a big component of the balance sheet it s not a high value business in and of itself but when you think about the excess deposits we have today there are more effective ways that we could deploy those into commercial loans even on a short term basis until we win them out in our relationship deals so it s more of an institutionalization and upgrade to what we have a little bit of growth on top of that it s not a giant effort it s not going to be a group of people erik zwick boenning scattergood inc analyst that s helpful i appreciate the explanation and then next on your comments that you expect the deposit beta to be lower going forward versus what you experienced in 4q i guess what gives you the confidence that you ll be able to hold the line christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer i m going to be careful our forward visibility is fairly limited right so i think we remain very close to our customers and we kind of get the ebb and flow of what they re thinking about in terms of deposit rates and the needs to get a return on their money we have a very large commercial cash management portfolio it s about 40 of the bank s deposits and some of those deposits are held in significantly large relationships so what we opted to do after we had a couple of conversations in the last six months or so is work with a few of those customers who may have had excess cash positions that they were beginning to think about either taking out of the bank or optimizing and we were able to put together structures that said look given the totality of the relationship here s how we re going to price your relationship in a way that both makes you comfortable and in return we re getting longer term commitments that they re going to stay with us so we went through that process in the commercial cash management book over the last several months but in earnest probably really in november and december and it was a defensive process to make sure that we were doing everything we can for our customers we have gotten through the major customers in that process as of 12 31 so the cost of deposits is a little higher as of 12 31 that ll carry forward a little bit into the first quarter but that s what you saw little higher beta in the fourth quarter it was a little bit of a catch up that is retrospective not prospective and in fact having negotiated a lot of that out with our clients i think we re in a good position at least for the next quarter or so that said in this kind of environment you ll be very careful about understanding what the price demands will be on your deposits i don t think you can see much more than 90 days 120 days erik zwick boenning scattergood inc analyst great thank you for taking my questions christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and the next question comes from joe gladue with alden securities please go ahead with your question joe gladue alden securities analyst good morning christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer good morning joe gladue alden securities analyst yeah pardon me if you covered this already i missed it but just wondering on the service charges and fees last quarter there was i guess some waivers to the sun bancorp customers just wondering if the full impact of those coming off was seen in the fourth quarter results are there still some additional upward bias to that figure going forward christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer there s not an upward bias i think it s about where you would expect it to be i would say in the third quarter we had some swap fee income that was a little higher than normal so there was a little bit extra in the third quarter and that will be a little lumpy we may have that on and off from quarter to quarter but from the deposit fee perspective i think we re at a steady state joe gladue alden securities analyst that s it from me thank you christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer all right thank you joe operator operator instruction and the next question comes from don koch with koch investments please go ahead with your question donald l koch koch investments llc analyst hey guys congratulations on 22 years of consecutive quarterly cash dividend that s a brilliant remark i mean that s very that s a hallmark that you should take an applause for so my question is christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer it s our entire life as a public company so thank you donald l koch koch investments llc analyst good well we ve been with you for at least more than that or anyhow my basic questions are strategic not tactical so tactically you are doing a brilliant job of increasing your penetration and your sandbox my concern is the right side of the balance sheet and the strategic notion that you want to have a low decay rate and a very low cost by a good retail right side of the balance sheet and in that regard the last time we had a conversation you were talking about major investment into sort of some kind of digital system where you had 24 hour telephone tellers helping seniors do something in areas that you wanted to be both offensive and defensive and assumptions of my question is you re playing brilliantly in the sandbox and you re getting penetration but the sandbox is actually contracting because you re in major areas that are out migrating i mean if you d go forward 10 years you re seeing people go in different regions michigan lost 1 million people california lost people that s basically high tax states and places like florida are gaining 1 000 people a day have you ever thought about following your customer base i know we ve had this discussion but at least a beachhead to take all those wonderful people who are in both philadelphia and new jersey and ocean and whiting and who migrate so you protect that and you keep that right side of the balance sheet with no decay rate at very low cost i mean how are you addressing my worry is that in the next five to 10 years that right side of the balance sheet won t be nearly as stable as you had hoped it would be because you re doing such a great job on the left side of the balance sheet so give me your thoughts on that please christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer sure the first is i would focus on your opening comments about digital and you mentioned one or two of the technologies we offer but we made a significant investment in digital in things wide and far so the investment in digital particularly in the consumer side is engineered to do a few things first to retain the customers we have so we think it s been a great job especially in the context of us having to consolidate as many branches as we have but we ve consolidated 34 branches in the last couple of years and kept our customers so that was a tremendous value creator for the company and digital allows you to allows you to span more geographies so i think over time once we feel we ve got digital really strong in our core footprint it would lend itself to expanding the market definition the second thing is we talked a lot about the commercial lending beachheads in new york and philadelphia and we are acutely aware that you ve got to be careful about geographies and to not have your business overly reliant on a single geography the first step in those metropolitan areas will be commercial loans but as we build out those areas i expect we ll do commercial cash management and then following commercial cash management especially if we have digital capabilities it will be easier to get a foothold in those markets and i would want to make sure that we ve done the best we can i ll use your sandbox analogy we want to be really great in our sandbox i think we can push the borders of our sandbox across the hudson river and across the delaware river and we ll do that slowly methodically and carefully but as much as we love our customers to spend some time in florida or arizona wherever they are i think we re going to preserve our capital and our investments to be closer to home for them donald l koch koch investments llc analyst okay thank you that s it christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to chris maher for any closing remarks christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer all right thank you i just want to thank everybody who participated in the call this morning and i

anyone searching for positive news about the global economy faces a tough challenge right now fading projections for corporate earnings and downbeat readings on growth suggest the outlook is dimming yet despite the steady drizzle of gloom during the first few weeks of 2019 investors have turned downright sunny in both canada and the united states stock markets have marched higher since new year s day this is not as crazy as it sounds several forecasters say the swoon in stock prices late last year set up markets for a healthy and sustained rebound this year if political clashes over brexit or china u s trade don t derail the global economy the optimists could well be right one of the most articulate bulls is robert buckland global equity strategist at citigroup in a report this week he predicted global stocks will gain 14 per cent over the course of this year despite the slowdown he expects in corporate earnings growth falling forecasts for earnings often go hand in hand with rising share prices he pointed out by his reckoning there have been 15 years since 1989 in which earnings forecasts have been revised down but stocks have gone up pessimism about the outlook for corporate earnings is already baked into today s share prices mr buckland said the sell off in was all about investors anticipating earnings per share downgrades in 2019 he averred we think that global equities are now pricing in a 1 per cent earnings per share contraction for the year his view is that analysts will probably continue to chop their earnings forecasts over the course of the year and that markets will shrug off the cuts this is not just wishful thinking analysts are usually too optimistic at the start of the year and trim their forecasts as the year proceeds as long as the cuts are under 10 per cent share prices can still advance according to mr buckland s analysis of market behaviour over the past three decades given his belief that this year of forecast revisions will amount to a relatively mild 4 per cent he argues that share prices around the world are more likely to go up than down over the next few months as long as there isn t a full blown global recession this of course amounts to a fairly major loophole and it is certainly possible to point to reasons for worry about what lies ahead nobel laureate paul krugman has warned about the possibility of what he terms a smorgasbord recession this would be a downturn caused by several discrete problems none of them individually overwhelming but cumulatively debilitating brexit slowing chinese growth trade wars and euro zone fiscal tensions are among the issues that could collectively overwhelm global growth a more specific reason for concern is a disappointing run of manufacturing readings around the world the early or flash versions of the ihs markit purchasing managers index pmi for january indicate declines in japanese and euro zone factory activity coupled with lacklustre readings on u s economic activity the pmis suggest year over year growth in advanced economies will drop below 2 per cent in the first quarter according to capital economics a london based forecaster we have long thought that the world economy would slow significantly in 2019 but the flash pmis for january provide an early sign that growth may be deteriorating more quickly than even we had assumed global economist simon macadam wrote this week the team at capital economics suggests that now is a good time to load up on high grade bonds and other refuges from economic chaos such as the u s dollar japanese yen and gold still a recession is far from a done deal the bank of canada for instance is at least modestly upbeat it has taken note of falling oil prices and downgraded its forecast for economic growth this year to 1 7 per cent but it predicts a rebound to 2 1 per cent in 2020 in the united states bloomberg s economic surprise monitor shows that many readings on industrial production retail sales real estate and the broad economy are falling short of forecasters expectations however gauges related to households and the jobs market are handily beating forecasters for investors trying to interpret this patchy picture is an impossible task but one reason to buy into the bullish case is the lack of obvious excesses such as those that preceded the financial crisis or the dot com crash most major stock markets appear reasonably priced when you compare share prices with expected earnings over the year to come canadian stocks for instance are at their cheapest valuations since 2013 by this measure even noted bears are detecting potential gmo llc a money manager in boston renowned for its pessimistic take on markets in recent years sounded uncharacteristically enthusiastic in a quarterly report this week the poor returns over the past year have a silver lining wrote ben inker head of asset allocation at the company many assets are now priced at levels that should deliver decent long term returns in general it looks to be the best opportunity set we have seen since 2009 he said both mr inker and mr buckland make a similar point the reason to be optimistic about stocks right now is precisely because expectations are so low for his part mr buckland is happy to acknowledge the gathering gloom he points out that citi s earnings revision index which tracks the number of analyst upgrades and downgrades around the world recently sank to its most negative reading since 2009 it looks especially bad in the u s and continental europe he says but that doesn t shake his faith that the market can still advance barring that global recession of course
watching activist van jones deliver a speech is an unforgettable experience dressed in his trademark black turtleneck black slacks and black sport jacket jones can step up to a podium and disarm listeners with a potent mix of confidence and modesty he speaks softly at first but as he makes a point about racism or the environment his voice rises and turns staccato afterward it s common to hear observers liken him to dr martin luther king jr trained as a lawyer jones has spent two decades fighting what he sees as an inefficient and prejudiced criminal justice system he defies easy categorization attorney human rights advocate political radical environmentalist churchgoing christian jones is all of these he can sit with two feet squarely on one side of an issue rising juvenile prison populations for example and simultaneously intuit how others might see the same problem differently recently jones has been connecting two issues that have largely been seen as separate worlds the abysmal conditions of u s inner cities and the need for a healthier planet to stem global warming jones argues the mainstream environmental movement must make itself relevant to low income americans why should a single parent working two jobs care about greenhouse gases if there are far more immediate concerns at hand jones calls for the creation of a green collar job corps that will train urban youth of color to retrofit u s cities so that they are environmentally sustainable jones grew up in rural tennessee and attended the university of tennessee where he wrote for the campus newspaper and started an underground publication called the 14th circle he also helped found the new alliance project a statewide african american newspaper and the third eye a nashville alternative monthly while interning one summer as a cub reporter in shreveport louisiana jones attended a rap concert where police officers lined the streets and helicopters traversed the sky in anticipation of violence although the crowd was largely mild mannered the next day his own newspaper led with a story that highlighted every noise violation and misdemeanor alongside the article was a map of the city marked with exploding bomb icons in jones s mind the coverage promoted the image that black youth were violent even when they were just attending a peaceful musical event disillusioned with journalism jones enrolled at yale law school with the hope of reshaping the laws that perpetuated injustice he arrived on campus with combat boots and a black panther party badge on his backpack in 1992 he spent a semester interning at the lawyers committee for civil rights in san francisco his internship coincided with the rodney king trial four white la police officers had been caught on videotape beating king an unarmed black motorist when three of the four officers were declared not guilty riots erupted in parts of la and spontaneous protests broke out across the country acting as a legal observer at the san francisco demonstrations jones was arrested alongside hundreds of activists in jail he met a broad cross section of young people fighting for change and was so impressed that after finishing law school he moved to san francisco to be part of their movement he went on to cofound the ella baker center for human rights ebc named for the civil rights heroine www ellabakercenter org their first office was a closet literally they pulled out the shelves and stuck a desk inside ten years later the ebc has twenty four people on staff and a 1 7 million budget its mission is to promote democratic control of law enforcement agencies and to advance alternatives to the incarceration of young people over the years jones s anger has given way to a passionate yet practical approach to fostering change he says he is willing to collaborate with anybody working toward the same ends regardless of background or affiliation jones s current campaign has been successful mostly because he is able to move between worlds from capitol hill to inner city streets due in large part to his efforts the u s house of representatives and the city of oakland california have recently passed legislation mandating the creation of green collar jobs in the aftermath of hurricane katrina jones spoke out about the intersections of race environmental injustice and poverty revealed by the disaster he cofounded colorofchange org an online community of four hundred thousand members that focuses specifically on african american issues jones s first book the future is getting restless is due out later this year jones lives in oakland with his wife jana and their three year old son cabral named after african revolutionary amilcar cabral i spoke with jones on a hot summer day at the ebc in oakland in a back room where several people were using the copy machine despite being the center s cofounder jones had a cramped office no bigger than the rest too cramped for our meeting amid the bustle he was focused and warm his voice lilting the same way it does when he gives a speech to a packed conference hall van jones kupfer what stake do people of color have in the environmental movement jones a big one it s the people of color who are disproportionately affected by bad food bad air and bad water people of color are also disproportionately unable to escape the negative consequences of global warming look at hurricane katrina people of color need equal protection from the worst environmental disasters and equal access to the best environmental technologies we should be speaking out ourselves on these issues because we are going to be hit first and hardest by everything negative and we will benefit last and least from everything positive unless everybody works to solve this problem kupfer what do you think are some of the primary lessons from katrina jones one lesson is that the right wing s ideology which says that we don t need government and we don t need each other is wrong we ve spent almost thirty years listening to them say that government is the problem not the solution that collectivism is inferior to individual strength and fortitude we ve heard for thirty years that people don t need government let them sink or swim then everyone turned on the television one day and saw an american city underwater and we saw people sink beneath that water as a direct consequence of that ideology it wasn t a deviation from what the right wing had been shouting about it was an inevitable outcome of their policies of defunding government and stripping away essential services a lot of those people in the floodwaters were hotel workers who scrubbed toilets and changed sheets for the tourists but they weren t unionized so their wages were much lower than those of hotel workers in say las vegas who are unionized so when the hurricane hit three days ahead of payday people didn t have the money to leave even if they worked every day they might not have a functioning car a credit card or money in the bank and they were left to make do with a free market evacuation plan that is the primary lesson of katrina in a flood there is no room for an ideology that says let your neighbor sink or swim we need a philosophy that says we are all in this together we are now entering an age of disasters an age of storms an age of perils rugged individualism isn t going to cut it certainly we need individuals to be responsible and to contribute but none of us can expect to be immune to the consequences of a few centuries worth of industrial pollution as those bills start to come due we are going to need each other if we don t retool our politics and our economy to reflect that then i think we will continue to embarrass ourselves on the world stage with our response to crises kupfer do you hold the army corps of engineers culpable for not maintaining the levees jones sure but there has been a wholesale neglect of public infrastructure by both political parties a bridge just fell in minnesota you are going to see more bridges and levees failing because we have put all our money into this warfare state i think the democratic party is beginning under pressure from its left wing and its grass roots to take a different view but even now during the presidential campaign you don t hear a full throated call for the sort of world war ii level mobilization that it s going to take to avert ecological catastrophe if you look at the scientific data on global warming you can see that we can t avoid a wholesale disaster unless we put this country back to work putting up solar panels weatherizing buildings and constructing wind farms on a massive scale even now the democratic party is bashful about calling for that kind of response we can t rely just on markets and technologies and consumer behavior that sort of eco elitism is a dead end eco populism is a better model for dealing with these problems we need a greater faith in communities government action voters and work kupfer last year voters in california turned down proposition 87 which would have increased taxes on big oil companies and used those funds to invest in renewable energy projects why didn t it pass jones we saw an alliance form between poor people and polluters the oil companies told the poor that proposition 87 was going to make their energy bills go up and send gas prices through the roof so the poor voted against it if polluters can appeal to poor folks and people of color in california and get them to kill a clean energy ballot measure that would have created jobs and cleaned up the air then the same could happen in any state in the union proposition 87 failed because the clean energy proponents didn t reach out to the people who feel the most vulnerable for the eco elites the idea of energy independence is exciting just by itself for the person who is dealing with bread and butter grits and gravy concerns that s all just pie in the sky nobody is showing people of modest means how they will benefit from green energy green is the new gold for rich eco entrepreneurs but it can be just one more burden for low income people if they get stuck paying higher rates you can t have a sustainable economy when only 20 percent of the people can afford to pay for hybrids solar panels and organic cuisine while the other 80 percent are still driving pollution based vehicles to the same pollution based jobs and struggling to make purchases at wal mart kupfer you often speak about eco apartheid could you define it jones eco apartheid is a situation in which you have ecological haves and have nots in other words if you are in the san francisco bay area and you visit marin county you ll find hybrid vehicles solar panels organic food organic everything if you then get in your car and drive twenty minutes you ll be in west oakland where people are literally choking on the fumes of the last century s pollution based technologies that s eco apartheid and it s morally wrong because we should deliver clean jobs and health benefits not just to the wealthy but also to the people who need them most eco apartheid doesn t work on a practical level either because you can t have a sustainable economy when only 20 percent of the people can afford to pay for hybrids solar panels and organic cuisine while the other 80 percent are still driving pollution based vehicles to the same pollution based jobs and struggling to make purchases at wal mart for the sustainable economy to be successful it has to be a full participation economy right now it is a niche economy a lifestyle economy though green products are a 230 billion industry and growing that s still a slice of a slice of a slice of the overall pie it is easy for the eco elites in massachusetts or northern california to wrap themselves in the trappings of sustainability and think that the problem has been solved but the people who clean their houses are going back to neighborhoods that may be fifty years in the past in terms of their ecological sustainability as we move toward a sustainable economy if we do not take care to minimize the pain and maximize the gain for the poor they will join forces with the polluters to derail the green revolution it s important from both a moral standpoint and a purely crass political point of view that we create a new deal coalition among green businesspeople labor the poor and people of color you unite groups by offering immediate as well as long term benefits for each constituency for poor people that could take the form of job opportunities better mass transportation and free bus passes obviously you ll want to split the business community the problem makers should get nothing but grief the problem solvers should get plenty of support right now the problem makers the warmongers the polluters the clear cutters the incarcerators get all the support they need from the government the problem solvers the solar engineers and the people who are growing local and organic produce get very little support from any level of government we want to lure the government away from the problem makers and put it back on the side of the problem solvers give them the tax breaks the subsidies and the incentives and starve those other guys another part of the new deal strategy is to give labor plenty of support we have to find union wage jobs for low income people and those are just the sort of jobs that building a sustainable infrastructure will create but it will require government action public private partnerships and most of all leadership kupfer what s the status of the green jobs act of 2007 which you have helped advance in congress jones the bill has passed through both houses of congress and president bush has signed it into law as a part of the energy bill the act authorizes 125 million a year to train people for green collar jobs twenty percent of that is dedicated to helping those who need the most support the poor and unemployed high school dropouts and formerly incarcerated people i call it green pathways out of poverty the green economy will be strong enough to lift people out of poverty but only if the people who need the jobs most receive training and support otherwise you re just retraining the existing workforce and not making a dent in the larger social problem we are standing on the verge of a new economy in the u s and we need to think about who this economy will include and who it will exclude it would be easy to say that once we have renewable this and organic that everybody will benefit but that s not a progressive policy it s just trickle down reaganomics in greenface of course there will be jobs created but will kids over in west oakland be able to get those jobs will we be satisfied with a sustainable economy that at the end of the day is eco apartheid is a green economy only about reclaiming throwaway stuff or is it also about reclaiming throwaway communities throwaway people throwaway children in the last century people of color fought for equal opportunity in the gray pollution based economy certainly we should fare better in the green economy because its leaders are supposed to be more passionate about inclusion and equal access kupfer are you finding much long term commitment from the democratic leadership jones that remains to be seen we ve deliberately kept the numbers relatively small so far next we are going back to congress to ask for 1 billion to lift a quarter million people out of poverty and into green collar jobs that process will involve job training employer incentives and more house speaker nancy pelosi is passionate about the current 125 million green jobs bill what she will think about 1 billion is another question but i believe there is leadership in the democratic party that will embrace it cole thompson kupfer have you seen this new deal coalition that you re calling for beginning to form jones we have seen it locally here in oakland the oakland city council is very fractious there are eight members and ten factions on that council but they voted unanimously to create a green jobs corps committing a quarter million dollars of city money they might disagree on everything else but they can agree that giving our young people job training and job opportunities is important to my knowledge this is the first time a city has had a green jobs corps our slogan is green jobs not jails we are seeing a new kind of social uplift environmentalism and a new image of an environmentalist with a hard hat a lunch bucket and rolled up sleeves somebody who says give us the tools give us the technology we can fix america i believe this kind of working class eco populism will become the dominant political mode for progressives in the new century as we put people to work weatherizing buildings installing solar panels building windmills and creating public transportation systems it used to be that the more radical you were on environmental issues the farther you were from working class people poor people and people of color because you were making individual lifestyle changes that alienated you from the majority you looked different you ate different foods you wore different clothes working class people were shopping at wal mart and eating at mcdonald s and you were mad at them for it with this new environmentalism the more radical you are on environmental solutions the closer you are to the working class we ve reached the limits of what can be done with individual lifestyle choices from now on it s going to require a massive investment from government and the private sector to completely restructure the economy if you re a radical environmentalist you may still look a little odd but you have a reason to talk to that labor leader that african american preacher that kid living in rural or urban poverty who doesn t have a future you can say to that person we want you to help save the world and you can get paid doing it once activists do that i think a new day will dawn in american politics you are going to see a major realignment as occurred with the new deal and the great society programs of the mid twentieth century and the rise of the far right toward the end of that century both the welfare state and the warfare state are exhausted ideas in u s politics there has to be a new political center of gravity where people join with government to try to solve the problems of the economy and the environment those people are going to be the eco entrepreneurs progressive labor and antipoverty activists who are looking to create ecologically responsible jobs they will show that you can have a populist movement based on environmental values kupfer do you think that the green jobs initiative will help soften the social economic and ecological shocks to come jones as much as they can be softened one good thing about green collar jobs is that they can t be outsourced if you want to weatherize this building you can t ship it to india or china if you want to build wind farms it s the wind blowing in the u s that has to be captured if you want to install solar panels it s the sun shining on the u s they have to catch green collar jobs create a stable source of employment for u s workers who right now are under tremendous pressure from india and china god bless india and china i want their economies to do well but the outsourcing of good blue collar manufacturing jobs has created enormous social and political instability in the u s right now the far right has overplayed its hand and the progressives have an opportunity to take advantage of that in 2008 we are likely to elect a democratic president house and senate but there s no guarantee we will keep them we can t afford a repeat of what we saw from 1992 to 1994 when president bill clinton and a democratic congress lost the ball and republicans rallied behind newt gingrich and took over the congress i think we need eight to twelve years of progressive stewardship to deal with our ecological problems the only way we are going to get that is if working people feel that help is on the way and that somebody on the left is concerned about the economic crisis in this country kupfer is this what some refer to as the politics of inclusion jones yes in some ways it s the opposite of the traditional white mainstream environmentalist approach environmentalists sometimes don t understand that what motivated them to get involved in political activism and change their lifestyle isn t going to inspire everyone else it s not just a matter of their explaining louder and louder why everyone should be like them that s not the politics of inclusion that s the politics of elitism the reality is that working people will support ecological solutions but not for the same reasons that the eco elites support them a lot of wealthy educated people wanted to take action as a result of al gore s documentary an inconvenient truth but most low income people and people of color i know had no interest in seeing the movie in the first place they already have enough problems they don t need new crises to worry about around here we say that the people who already have a lot of opportunities are the ones who need to hear about the crises so if you have a house and a car and a college degree then yes you should hear about global warming or peak oil or dying species but poor and low income people need to hear about opportunities they need to hear about the expected reduction in asthma rates when we reduce greenhouse gases they need to hear about the wealth and health benefits of moving to a sustainable economy otherwise you are just telling people who are already having a bad day that they should have a worse one the politics of inclusion requires that you let different people approach ecological issues through different doors wanting to create jobs for poor kids has to be just as valid an entryway as concern about the rain forest these different crises political ecological and spiritual are all interlocked the people who are dominating the environmental discussion right now want everybody to watch their movie sign their petition and march in line behind them but the movement cannot grow the way we need it to unless we let the working class guy and the undocumented worker and the poor kid from the inner city articulate their own agendas it s no surprise that the country that has the world s biggest pollution problem also has the most prisons we ve got a disposable mind set disposable products disposable species disposable people kupfer you ve also been involved over the years with prisoners rights and prison reform what challenges do we face in reforming the criminal justice system jones people ask me what do prisons have to do with the ecological crisis to me it s no surprise that the country that has the world s biggest pollution problem also has the most prisons we ve got a disposable mind set disposable products disposable species disposable people we don t see our sisters and brothers much less all the animal species as sacred the failure to honor the sacred is at the root of both problems most of our prison population growth has come from convictions on nonviolent drug offenses which rich people and poor people commit in equal measure but for which only poor people end up serving time when i was at yale i saw more drugs on campus than i saw in the poor community but the police never kicked in the door at the skull and bones society and made arrests there they were busy arresting people in the housing projects drug users need treatment not jail time we know how to take care of people who are in trouble with drugs because we do it for rich kids we should do the same thing for poor addicts because it s the right thing to do and we d save money doing it california which is considered a liberal state spends more money on prisons than any other state in the country not because it is bigger but because it has the wrong strategy the governor wants to expand the size of the prison system by fifty thousand beds the population of a couple of small towns we need to be moving in the opposite direction in california the juvenile prisons are like expensive prep schools for adult prison we are beating and brutalizing these kids and 90 percent of them end up as repeat offenders in the so called red state of missouri on the other hand they are taking juvenile offenders out of huge prisons and placing them in small dormlike facilities the doors have locks but rather than the kids putting on orange uniforms and having adults in blue uniforms scream at them all day everyone dresses normally they have coaching counseling art instruction yoga and gardening seventy percent of those kids never get in trouble again because they are being treated like human beings not savage creatures that missouri program costs 30 000 a year per kid as opposed to the 120 000 a year we are spending here in california think of what you could do with a troubled kid and 120 000 a year you could take the kid to europe you could buy the kid a hybrid you could say here s fifty grand if you stay out of trouble for a year i ll give you seventy more there is no way that that kid should ever get in trouble again we should close the prisons and bring the prisoners and the guards home and help them heal and then put them to work installing solar panels and pursuing urban forestry and gardening and organic agriculture but first we have to give up our addiction to punishment i believe there will come a day when there will be no such thing as a green building there will just be buildings and what is now green technology will become just the way things are done kupfer dealing with the prison guards union here in california must be a significant challenge jones the prison guards union is the main obstacle to prison reform in california at the moment it s unfortunate but the union pushes for tougher laws so that more people will be locked up for longer periods which means we ll have to build more prisons and hire more guards which means a bigger union and more union dues then the union uses those dues to push for even tougher laws right now we don t have a criminal justice system we have a massive incarceration industry that has to be fed with human bodies kupfer some years ago you helped found the group bay area policewatch a legal help line for victims of police misconduct since then a number of comparable groups have sprouted up around the country have you seen progress in the effort to end abuse on the part of law enforcement agencies jones unfortunately we haven t instead we ve seen an expansion of police power with no corresponding expansion of police oversight which is always a recipe for abuse any human system that doesn t have adequate checks and balances will tend toward corruption it s hard to have a rational discussion about law enforcement in the u s because the right wants to divide everyone into cop lovers and cop haters all we re saying is that oversight is needed you can call for meat inspections without hating butchers or building inspections without hating architects and you can call for increased police oversight without hating anybody in law enforcement since i started working on these issues in the 1990s we ve seen police state like measures being taken against muslims in certain parts of this country we ve seen the loss of habeas corpus and the creation of secret prisons around the world and the abuses at guantánamo bay in cuba and abu ghraib in iraq these are features of a society that has turned its back on its best traditions if the project of western civilization has anything to offer the world it s our accomplishments in the domain of human rights as recently as five years ago that contribution would have been unarguable now it s become harder to defend that position because the same society that s bulldozing the planet is also bulldozing its own bill of rights the constitution is burning along with the rain forests kupfer among the current crop of political leaders do you see any you think can own up to our country s misdeeds and move us forward jones i don t think that in the near term a politician who wants the country to repent for its sins past or present will get very far we need to be tough on our problems without being tough on america it is a complicated dance for any reform movement how to point out the shortcomings and even the crimes of the system and still inspire people to change the system rather than shoot the messenger some environmentalists and progressives want people to sign a contract that says america is messed up i think more people want to sign a contract that says america is a great country but we could be even greater i can t go home to tennessee and tell people they are living in a terrible country i think the late 1960s was really the last time the politics of shame blame and confrontation had any mass appeal i am interested in the meat and potatoes kitchen table politics that uplifts people who need a break and offers them power dignity and solutions cybelle codish kupfer you seem to be a bridge builder you re known for connecting different sectors is that a conscious strategy jones i don t wake up in the morning thinking how can i get groups together i m just looking for solutions to problems and there is no way to solve the problems we face with the black people over here and the lesbians over there and the labor unions off by themselves global warming the impacts of economic globalization on the u s working class confrontations with islamic fundamentalism none of these can be resolved by any one constituency even a powerful constituency like big business the only way to solve these problems is to bring everyone together it used to be that to people working for racial justice the environment was a side issue the same was true of those working for the environment racial justice was an add on that approach won t work anymore social problems are driving ecological problems which are feeding back into social problems you have to deal with both at the same time if you try to fix poverty with suburban sprawl and pollution based economic development you are going to sink the environment but if you preserve the environment by outlawing development you then strand poor people and displace workers they re not going to starve to death so that you can have trees they are going to fight for their survival you have got to come up with economic development that honors the real constraints of the natural world all roads lead to the same solution a green collar jobs agenda that puts people to work reengineering our production waste energy and water processes kupfer do you identify yourself primarily as an environmentalist or a social justice activist jones right now i fall between the two categories people on the social justice side think van is a green person and people on the environmental side think van is a social justice person those categories are going to fall away i believe there will come a day when there will be no such thing as a green building there will just be buildings and what is now green technology will become just the way things are done we are in a transition phase of our history suicidal industrial capitalism is in a slow motion collapse we just hope it collapses faster than the environment and a greener ecologically wiser form of capitalism is emerging the danger is that the al gores of the world believe technology consumer education and voter education by themselves will solve this problem they will not they are important but without strong government programs that put millions of people to work the transition will prove to be too difficult when we move to protect the environment there will be economic shocks and the left will be voted out of office and replaced with even more reactionary elements than we have in the white house right now yes there will be environmental benefits later but you have to offer people some benefits right now to keep them invested in this process and show them that you care otherwise people who can t afford to buy a hybrid or shop at whole foods feel left out and lectured to and they will be happy to walk across the street and work for chevron or shell kupfer as you travel around speaking to different groups do you see more unity on the left jones ever since dr martin luther king jr and bobby kennedy were assassinated in 1968 i think people on the left have longed for a leader who would divide the right and unite progressives well that leader has emerged and his name is george w bush president bush has divided the right and united the left in a way no other political leader has for a generation over the past five years i ve seen more and more progressives willing to work together listen to each other and put aside their differences the iraq war global warming and the fragility of the economy have opened the eyes of people who were narrowly focused on their own issues and constituencies now they are looking at these problems anew and looking around for friends instead of enemies people on the left have tended to define themselves by who their enemies are and what they refuse to do now we are beginning to define ourselves by who our allies are and what we are willing to do when the democrats won back congress in november 2006 it was the end of six years of one party authoritarian rule by the republicans six years in which our leaders managed to squander the budget surplus create a massive deficit destroy iraq and play chicken with china on global warming none of the democrats we elected in 2006 was that great but the worst of the republicans are out of power in the house and senate and the left has the opportunity to make real gains and progress i do not know how well we are going to do if we cling to the last century s answers progressives are not going to get anywhere we ve seen that soviet style industrial socialism has horrible ecological consequences the same as western style industrial capitalism any industrial model socialist capitalist or otherwise is not sustainable the question we are wrestling with now is not who owns the means of production but what will be the means of production kupfer do you think the democrats success in 2006 has to do with a generational shift as more younger people are stepping up to the plate and older conservatives are dying off jones no the republicans simply didn t play their hand well with iraq or global warming or katrina the far right took over the whole republican party and ran it into the ground and ran the country into the ground now they are about to run the planet into the ground all of this has repelled independents and young people who haven t made up their minds about party affiliation so no i don t think demographics alone can explain what we re seeing and i definitely don t think any democratic strategy can take credit for it the left stayed in its circular firing squad throughout this whole period the republicans simply became victims of classic imperial overreach we shouldn t pat ourselves on the back for their misfortune they blew it now we have to figure out how to take advantage of that kupfer do you feel there is an inherent contradiction between a free market economy and a sustainable society jones there probably is it would be arrogant for anybody to say that twentieth century capitalism is the last word for humanity that we will never invent a better way to allocate wealth but even if capitalism isn t viable in the long term there is no way to get to a postcapitalist world except by going through a green capitalism phase i think there will be a postcapitalist society i can t predict what it will look like except to say that it won t resemble the last century s attempts in that direction the immediate challenge however is to make capitalism as green and humane as we possibly can doing that will conceivably buy us a few more decades or centuries on the planet kupfer how do you deal with cynicism and apathy jones some people are committed to being cynical and they have their role which is to keep asking the tough questions i use those people to keep my own thinking sharp but right now a lot of good people are being cynical who shouldn t be some of them accuse me of being inspirational as if that were a bad thing i hope that i am inspirational about projects that excite me i want to break people out of their cynicism because the level of cynicism that we have been indulging in is a luxury that we cannot afford it is indulgent to live in the richest most advanced technological society in history and say we cannot do it we have the best shot of anyone at solving the big problems we have technologies that thirty years ago people couldn t have imagined the internet laptop computers cellphones you and i have better computers on our person than the u s government had when it landed a man on the moon everyone you know is a walking technological superpower by the standards of thirty years ago to be playing helpless and throwing up our hands when we haven t even tried to solve these problems is totally unacceptable to me there was a speech that winston churchill gave in the early days of world war ii before the u s entered the war british citizens felt they were living in darker days do not let us speak of darker days he said let us speak rather of sterner days these are not dark days these are great days that is how i feel these are difficult times but these are great times it s when the authoritarians have taken over your country and are running it into the ground and the earth is crying out for a change of course that people have to look within and figure out where they stand i think many people are willing to stand together and make the necessary sacrifices it is going to be a tough period but i m betting that this country s best days lie ahead

in our earnings release and in our sec filings this conference call will be made available on our website or by phone replay approximately two hours after the end of this call now here s todd todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today yesterday briggs reported robust second quarter sales growth of 13 on strength across multiple dimensions of our business both business segments engines power and products contributed to this result in both residential and commercial categories for the fiscal second quarter we delivered adjusted eps of 0 20 per share adjusted gross margins were lower in the second quarter due to lower engine production some operational inefficiencies primarily driven by lower throughput in our service distribution center hub and sales mix we made great strides during the quarter toward improving our service parts distribution capabilities and this business is now well positioned as we enter the peak selling season at the same time we announced a revision to our outlook to reflect near term headwinds related to two issues the effects of prolonged severe drought in australia and europe and the sears bankruptcy combined and including the partial offset from incremental storm related sales we re reducing our annual sales outlook by approximately 50 million and earnings by 0 30 per diluted share i d like to provide some context to the revision in the fiscal first in the fiscal 2019 first quarter we projected that u s generator sales related to hurricanes florence and michael would offset the weather headwinds in australia and europe we recently recently concluded that the australia and europe weather conditions are likely to be more impactful than previously estimated specifically the drought in australia did not abate in time for the growing season to recover and our second quarter sales in the region were lower than expected in europe where the market is significantly more fragmented than in the u s we received more input from channel partners throughout the second quarter and learned that the historic heat and drought conditions from this past season resulted in channel inventory levels that were more elevated than previously estimated regarding sears as we previewed last quarter we believe that the bankruptcy caused some disruption during the upcoming lawn and garden season in the u s accordingly we adjusted our outlook to account for store closures and lower channel inventory stocking we expect that much of this market disruption will ease by next season as consumers migrate their shopping patterns and adjust to this change in the retail landscape despite the near term market headwinds we ll make every effort to offset the challenges we highlighted during the remainder of our fiscal year we remain confident in our long term strategy to grow sales and profitability and are pleased that commercial sales growth remains very solid and on track for the year in addition with line reviews for the upcoming season now complete i m pleased to report that we maintained our industry leading engine placement at the major retailers especially given the significant brand transitions that retail this season in particular we are very proud to continue our long tradition of powering craftsman branded products and are eager to help support our channel partners as this iconic brand has launched at lowe s this spring for a lawn and garden homeowner shopping for lawn mowers this season including craftsman branded models will find our engines very well represented equally encouraging is the exceptional progress made in building our commercial business the quarter commercial sales were up more than 20 or approximately 30 million year to date commercial sales have increased over 17 and we are well on track to achieve very strong growth for the year while all parts of commercial performed well commercial engines in job site stood out both advancing more than 30 in the quarter vanguard commercial engines are powering more applications than ever before with higher quality durability and reliability than the competition our commercial engines are making substantial share gains in lawn and garden equipment construction equipment and storm related applications an important element of this success has been offering new products that improve productivity and uptime for contractors to date this fiscal year we ve expanded business with more than 20 current customers and secured business with about as many new customers we have been more demanding more product powered by vanguard engines through rental houses distributors we are pleased with the success of this multiyear strategy in which there is still considerable opportunity for the growth business diversification is also benefiting job site with a broader range of products and stronger distribution we are now serving applications in entertainment infrastructure and general rental in addition to our traditional base in oil and gas and construction with a full business pipeline we announced the facility expansion for our job site business to increase production capacity and improve productivity and speed to market expansion includes new modern assembly lines a prototyping lab to assist customers on product configuration a new paint system and efficient robotic welding cells expansion is scheduled for completion by the end of calendar 2019 operationally we ve made significant progress on our business optimization program the onshoring of commercial engines is proceeding on plan with the production of vanguard engines ramping up on schedule at our auburn alabama plant customers are recognizing the high quality of the engines produced at the plant and appreciate the faster delivery times attention has now turned to our statesboro georgia plant which began production of vanguard engines in late december and is expected to reach full production by the end of this fiscal year also in the second quarter we made all the necessary preparations to enable the remaining production of various commercial mowers to shift to our new facility in upstate new york early in the third quarter located only a few miles from our older outdated facility the new manufacturing site doubles production capacity and improves throughput commercial turf has been on a steady upward trajectory for several years and the new ferris facility gives us the production capacity needed to support further growth we also made significant progress in the quarter with the upgrade of our erp system in addition to the improvements that are benefiting our service parts distribution throughput we continue to make strides across the organization in adapting to streamline processes and new tools taken together we now estimate that our business optimization program will deliver pre tax savings of 35 million to 40 million by 2021 up from our previous estimate of 30 million to 35 million the incremental improvement comes primarily from higher than planned efficiencies we expect to achieve from several aspects of the program we are well on track with our strategic priorities and i am proud of our team which has driven the great progress made today at our challenging market conditions and here is mark to walk you through our financial results for the fiscal 2019 second quarter and provide details on the earnings revision mark schwertfeger chief financial officer thanks todd i ll begin by touching on some highlights from the financial results second quarter gaap consolidated net loss of 2 6 million included 10 7 million in business optimization pre tax cost 200 000 premiums paid on the repurchase of senior notes and 200 000 on acquisition integration pre tax costs the net loss also includes a onetime tax charge of 1 1 million related to finalizing estimates on the inclusion of foreign earnings related to the implementation of u s tax reform excluding these items fiscal 2019 second quarter adjusted net income was 8 4 million or 0 20 per diluted share a decrease from 10 7 million or 0 25 per diluted share a year ago the engine segment incurred approximately 7 5 million dollars of the pre tax business optimization costs and the product segment incurred the remaining 3 2 million as well as the acquisition integration cost engine segment sales for the second quarter were 272 million an increase of 29 million or 12 engine unit sales increased by 17 or approximately 274 000 engines on the strength of shipments for commercial applications and timing of shipments for residential applications due to several factors including our erp upgrade go live approximately 15 million of sales shifted from the first quarter to the second in addition sales of approximately 20 million were accelerated from the third quarter for customers in north america to begin production earlier than last year sales of service parts increased year over year by over 6 million in the quarter due to reduced throughput of our distribution center hub we experienced a steady improvement in throughput throughout the second quarter from the improvements we drove that todd commented on earlier international sales decreased in the quarter due to weather related softness in europe and australia the engine segment adjusted gross profit margin was 20 7 which was down from 23 1 last year the decrease was largely driven by lower manufacturing volumes unfavorable sales mix of approximately 100 basis points and inefficiencies from lower throughput in our service distribution centers higher pricing largely offset higher material costs including tariffs engine production volume in the quarter was 1 2 million units which was 7 lower than the second quarter last year total engine inventories at the end of the quarter were approximately 2 1 million units which is a decrease of approximately 230 000 units from the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 the decrease largely came in small engines which is why engine inventory dollars are consistent year over year we continue to anticipate that fiscal 2019 year end engine inventory dollars will be lower than at the end of fiscal 2018 engine segment adjusted esg a held relatively steady with a decrease in the second quarter of 2019 by approximately 1 million from year ago largely due to lower variable compensation adjusted segment income for engines was 12 2 million up from 10 7 million last year product segment net sales for the second quarter increased by 15 or 33 million to 255 million the increase was largely driven by higher pressure washer sales and growth in sales of allmand commercial job site products ferris commercial mowers and the hurricane acquisition which added stand on blowers to our product portfolio product segment adjusted gross profit margin decreased from 17 to 15 largely due to sales mix and manufacturing inefficiency the sales mix was a result of lower storm generator sales because of a less active hurricane season this year compared to a year ago and timing of product mix within both residential and commercial offerings higher pricing offset increases in material costs including tariffs products segment adjusted esg a expenses increased by approximately 2 million or 7 this year due to higher employee compensation costs and higher commission expense on increased sales volume on the balance sheet net debt at the end of the second fiscal quarter was approximately 476 million which was 191 million higher than a year ago the increase is primarily due to last year s discretionary pension contribution of 30 million investments in the business optimization program and higher working capital amounts following the suboptimal lawn and garden season last year we also increased inventory purchases from china in the prior prior to quarter end to take advantage of lower tariff costs last 12 month cash used by operating activities was 58 million which was largely due to the factors that resulted in higher net debt second quarter sales were weighted toward the end of the quarter which resulted in elevated accounts receivable that will be collected early in the third quarter inventory dollars at the end of the second quarter were also elevated both to facilitate the plant transitions and progress for vanguard engines and ferris mowers and lower than planned sales in australia from the drought conditions there last 12 months free cash flow was a negative 150 million with capital expenditures totaling 92 million over the period for the quarter depreciation and amortization of 16 million was higher than capital expenditures of 13 million which are trending down following the bulk of expenditures related to our business optimization program year to date capital spending is down 11 million or over 25 and we expect capital spending of approximately 65 million for fiscal 2019 regarding the business optimization program we now estimate achieving up to 40 million in pre tax savings by 2021 we also estimate that pre tax charges related to the program will be 60 million to 70 million up from our initial estimate of 50 to 55 million total program charges incurred to date through the second quarter were 52 million or approximately 80 of total expected program charges the increase is primarily related to costs associated with the go liveof our upgraded erp at the end of the quarter last 12 month average funded debt was 382 million and last 12 month ebitda was 147 million both as defined by our credit agreements resulting in a leverage ratio of 2 6 times which is well within our debt covenants before i turn the call back over to todd for his closing remarks i want to offer some further insights into our updated fiscal 2019 outlook there were three primary reasons for the revised guidance which todd commented on earlier first we are adjusting our outlook for the sears holdings bankruptcy this past season sears full line stores covered approximately 500 locations and represented a little over 10 of the residential lawn and garden market in the u s should sears emerge from bankruptcy it is expected to operate less than half the stores that were in place last season it is also unknown what products the remaining stores will offer and how frequently consumers will visit the stores we continue to believe that sears channel inventory is low but liquidation of inventory from closed stores is likely to cause some market disruptions in addition we expect that a portion of consumers who previously shopped at sears will not immediately migrate to new retailers we estimate the sales impact of sears at 30 million and earnings at 0 15 per share the impact is predominantly comprised of engine and service part sales the majority of which would have been sold in during our third quarter second poor weather conditions in australia have extended beyond our original expectations and have resulted in lower overall demand in season in addition the drought in europe last summer has contributed to high inventories in the channel of engines mowers and service parts together we expect lower sales of 40 million due to weather in australia and europe of which we have incurred approximately 30 million of the decrease through december we expect the remaining amount of 10 million to largely impact the third quarter partially offsetting this is the benefit of approximately 20 million of generator sales in the first half of fiscal 2019 related to hurricanes florence and michael net we estimate these weather related items will reduce sales by approximately 20 million and eps by 0 15 lastly in order to proactively manage working capital we played the lower engine production volumes by 10 compared to last year s production volume with this change we expect third quarter production to be approximately 300 000 units or 15 lower than last year s third quarter production despite this reduction we are confident that we have adequate safety stock in plant production to meet customer demand in the back half of the year we will actively work to reduce expenses to help offset the impact of lower plant throughput through the remainder of the fiscal year partially offsetting the near term headwinds we expect the engine segment will encounter in the third quarter we anticipate robust sales growth in the third quarter within our product segment due to our focus on selling higher end commercial and residential lawn and garden equipment through our north america dealer channel now let me turn the call back over to todd for some closing remarks todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thanks mark we entered the second half of fiscal 2019 with favorable momentum in our commercial business and a stronger leading position serving the power needs of the consumer we have made great progress improving the efficiency of our part distribution business and are now well positioned as we approach the peak selling season for lawn and garden in north america at the same time we recognize the temporary headwinds caused by weather conditions in europe and australia as well as the channel related matters around sears as a result we re taking appropriate responsible actions to align production with demand to ensure adequate product availability while focusing on generating an improved cash flow stream overall briggs is in a stronger competitive position today which is a direct result of our focus on innovation and driving consumer driven power solutions expanding global channels to reach our reach more customers and diversifying into high growth commercial businesses as a result we are now in the latter stages of our business optimization program and as a result we are well positioned to drive costs lower improve working capital efficiency and deliver better returns on investment in addition to driving further profitable growth in commercial our priorities for the second half of fiscal 2019 are one focusing on executing on the upcoming lawn and garden season we are encouraged by our placement for the upcoming season and excited about the support we are seeing promoting the brand transitions two internally we will be working to manage working capital to improve cash generation we ended the second quarter with higher inventories in part to support the vanguard and ferris manufacturing transitions we are completing this year as mark commented earlier in response to lower than planned sales we intend to adjust production downward in the second half of the year to control inventories three maintaining our high level of innovation we are very pleased with the success of our commercial business which has built the foundation of offering customers demonstrably better products to maintain this momentum plans are now under way to refresh and expand our line of job site equipment which is also experiencing strong growth in commercial engines we will be launching an expanded range of horizontal engines to complement our 200 cc model which is meeting with strong customer acceptance and an important element in our success in expanding the range of power applications we serve finally we will continue to follow through on our business optimization program the third quarter transition of the remaining ferris mower production into a larger more efficient plant and our erp upgrade as well as the smooth ramp up of vanguard commercial engines brought onshore we are now nearing the end of implementing this broad based initiative financial benefits from it will begin flowing in the second half of this fiscal year with substantially further cost savings coming in fiscal 2020 and the full benefit of fiscal 2021 let me finish with a word on capital allocation we continue to evaluate the allocation of our resources to those areas that deliver the highest risk adjusted returns to date we are pleased with the value creating investments in the business optimization program in addition we look forward to the first full year s contribution from the hurricane and ground logic acquisitions which should advance our strategy of filling out the professionals trailer with innovative power equipment as we look for further investment opportunities our m a pipeline is filling with a range of bolt on acquisition opportunities that would accelerate the diversification of our business enhance long term growth and improve the overall profit profile of the company along with our investment discipline we remain mindful of ensuring that we maintain a strong balance sheet with appropriate financial leverage finally we continue to view stock repurchases as part of our investment options during the second quarter we repurchased 6 3 million of briggs shares and committed 11 4 million to stock buybacks in the year to date that concludes our prepared comments i would like to open up the call for questions questions and answers mark schwertfeger chief financial officer renz we can now open up the call to questions operator certainly sir your first question comes from the line of mr joe mondillo your line is now open joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst hi guys good morning todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning joe mark schwertfeger chief financial officer good morning joe joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst so i wanted to just touch on the guidance first off so you brought the revenue down 2 5 roughly and the eps comes down 20 so i m just curious just given what s going on we had the sears headwind which we knew about we had the weather in europe and the inventory levels there that we sort of knew about is there any other i m just wondering is there any other flexibility that we have within the business model to try to prevent such volatility and the bottom line relative to fluctuations in the top line like that mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes joe the other factors that contributes to the bottom line versus top line one is the production volume and we re doing the responsible thing from a working capital perspective in taking down the engine production as much as 500 000 units compared to what we ve talked through previously when we came out with guidance at the beginning of the year and has to keep the inventory levels in check and that has a pretty big impact on the absorption of our manufacturing facilities the second piece has to do with sales mix as well and the european and australian lawn and garden markets are a little bit different than the u s from a price point perspective and so having some headwinds there can create some margin pressure from a sales mix perspective which is what you re seeing also as part of the australia and europe as well as sears impact there is a component of service parts sales that are impacted by that reduction and those as many with many other manufacturers come at a higher margin profile relative to the whole book todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer and what i d tell you joe is that as we look forward if you think about all the things we ve done over the last few years with commercial engines and products and that sort of thing i mean that adds diversification of the business and so the business will be exposed to weather related type things whether it be hurricanes whether it be spring selling seasons whatever it is but at the end of the day when you look at commercial and our opportunities to not only grow in a higher market growth we also have the opportunity to gain share which you ve seen us do and then the margin profile is also better so i mean going forward the mix of business has changed will continue to change and but you get to these kind of transitory things whether it be the weather in the international markets or sears and they re going to have a near term impact but we re still very confident with where things are at in the long term joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok and then sort of just to transition with your comments there todd commercial doing good i mean better than even i was expecting in terms of residential side we had a really tough challenging spring last year and we were anticipating somewhat a rebound but obviously things have changed a little bit just in terms of the overall u s economy i think there s still growth there so do you have any visibility into the spring season can you talk about that and what you have sort of baked into your guidance what you re anticipating in terms of any rebound at all considering the comparison to last year todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes so when you look at what happened last year we had inventory destocking right in the channel so what was happening is with the brand transitions that were anticipated some of the retailers especially lowe s they took their inventories down because they knew they were going to bringing in craftsman this year so if you go back to a year ago it was pretty evident what was happening which is why when you look at what our guidance has been and is i mean we continue to see growth here a big part of that has to do with channel restocking and that s kind of what you saw here in q2 when you think about earlier production and earlier stocking that s why i mentioned in the prepared comments you get into the situation where we re starting to see some favorable things happen in north america lawn and garden now you got to remember too last year and you pointed out the weather wasn t it was snowing in the middle of april and whatever that happens it s starts to delay the season so i don t know what the weather forecast is going to be but at the end of the day we re feeling quite good about where the channel is going to be inventory wise and we re confident that if the season is a normal season remember we haven t had a normal season since 2015 if it s a normal season we re there to serve the market joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok great and then last question from me just in terms of engine placement could you provide any more color there it sounds like you re pretty pleased but do you have any sort of i don t know statistics or anything you also you can sort of provide regarding the engine placement mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes if you look across the board we commented that largely consistent year over year despite of the brand transition so we re particularly pleased with some of the larger engines that power riding lawn mowers and that we picked up some volume there this last year and then the other thing from an overall lineup perspective is that the major retailers we indeed expect a similar number of skus in the lineup compared to a year ago as it related to products that we power as well as the other gas engine companies power as well so those are really the encouraging things and like todd mentioned in the remarks too we ve very nice placement on the craftsman mowers at lowe s which was the big one of the big transitions coming into this upcoming year joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst so at the retailers on the residential side it sounds like sort of similar year over year are you achieving growth or more placement at the commercial side with your new engines todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes we ve seen continued upticks on the commercial side remember that doesn t that s not part of and you know this is not part of the retail channel it s really part of the dealer channel and so when you look at what we ve been able to do i think we ve got 20 new at least somewhere around 20 new customers this year and then the customers that we ve had we re seeing increased placements that s why you re seeing such tremendous growth in that commercial engine business because the people who are expecting our engines are continuing to do more and more of that joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst great thanks a lot todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mark schwertfeger chief financial officer thanks joe operator your next question comes from the line of tom hayes your line is now open tom hayes northcoast research analyst thanks good morning gentlemen todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer hi tom mark schwertfeger chief financial officer hi tom tom hayes northcoast research analyst todd i was wondering maybe it sounds like you re having great success in the commercial segment specifically with vanguard just maybe help us update the total opportunity you see there and kind of maybe where you are as a share position right now todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes so when you look at kind of share it s a very large market so we have a tendency to break the share down a little bit in terms of different segments and so if you think tom where we ve been if you think about where we ve been playing here as of late it s in that commercial turf space it s been a big piece although there s a lot of other applications that we ve been powering and so when you look at the commercial side our share is substantially lower than it would be for example on the residential side which is part of the reason you re seeing the tremendous growth in commercial engine so think about it this way if the market in these commercial areas generally go grow at about 2 time gdp we ve got substantially let s say it s about 2 5 3 we also have a 5 growth we re seeing substantially higher growth than that which means we re taking share but i would tell you we still have a fair amount of ways to fair ways to go in terms of the ability to take share and continue growth in that area and then on top of that i would tell you that on the vanguard v twin side where we re going to auburn and statesboro there s a lot of other applications that are out there that we can now really participate in and it s little bit more nichey but actually they re really good segments for us and they re really interesting things like mud boats powering mud boats and things like that where people actually go out and use the equipment to have fun so there s a whole aspect there and then when you look at the horizontal shaft we still have a very very low share in the horizontal think of single cylinder horizontal shaft market vanguard engines we ve got 200 cc we re coming out with 400 we ll have a 300 and 160 following so as we continue to broaden out that product offering on the single cylinder side there s some tremendous opportunities out there and so we re still encouraged because we think there are ways to go with the market growth but even probably more impactful is really opportunities to get new and more market share tom hayes northcoast research analyst ok great i appreciate the color just wanted to follow up i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks todd that the rental equipment market was holding up well i just wanted to kind of circle back and make sure i heard that right todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes we ve been doing very well on the rental equipment market and we ve been keeping a close eye on that to just to understand what some of the capex requirements will be now as we get into calendar 2019 and we re still seeing it hold up really pretty well there s obviously always noise around various aspects of that but overall we think that the we make great strides because we d be able to gain share so should a market turn down a bit we think we have more opportunities though because our share is pretty low and we can go and take share overall though i will tell you what we re hearing from the channel is that capex levels aren t going to drop dramatically they re going to be either flat to slightly up tom hayes northcoast research analyst ok i appreciate it and then mark i think you mentioned that 80 of the business optimization expenses have been occurred earlier in the first half of the year i mean should the balance be then split equally over the back half of the year or should most be done in 3q mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes my comment was actually 80 of the program cost to date but that also includes some in 2018 and so indeed if you were to expect quite a bit of deceleration in the back half of the year of expenditures of say roughly another 10 million or so to 15 million and indeed that would be fairly split between quarters tom hayes northcoast research analyst appreciate it thanks for the color operator your next question comes from the line of josh chan your line is now open josh chan private investor hi good morning todd and mark todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning josh josh chan private investor hi good morning yes thanks for the color on the guidance related to weather i just wanted to ask about the sears piece of it is it fair to assume that that reduction comes out primarily in the second half and are you basically assuming that not much sales goes into that channel for the year basically mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes we actually believe that most of the impact will be in the third quarter because that s typically when the market would load up sears or other retailers to be prepared for the season and at this point in time there s just a lot of uncertainty as to whether sears will merge and how it will merge and so therefore we do think that that impact will be back half and mainly q3 todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes josh let me just even a little bit more color so if you think about the inventory stock up that would normally happen because their hearing isn t until the first week of february you which again they ve kind of missed the stock up because normally store set start in the south about now and then they work their way up and so we just don t think that they re going to have the kind of inventory stocking they would otherwise have especially given fewer stores then you think about they have very low inventory we believe we don t have full visibility but we believe low inventory at the dc level but they ll use that inventory then to stock up the existing stores should they emerge from bankruptcy and but ultimately what it comes back to is what kind of then will the consumers there s less points of light out there how will they adjust and so ultimately we believe that it really is more q3 and because they will take whatever inventory they have and then try to sell that out and then quite honestly the oems i don t know that the oems i know they re not building for sears right now the question is when will they slot them in for production should they emerge from bankruptcy so there s just a lot of moving pieces around the sears situation which is why we took the tack we did and expect that in q3 where we ll see most of the impact josh chan private investor ok yes appreciate the color there i think that definitely makes sense and then on the on the pull ahead that you saw in north america could why do you think that is and do you think it s related to tariff s price increases or that craftsman outside of sears weld in in q2 why did you see that pull ahead in the quarter todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes so what happened is if you go back through the last few years you kind of alluded to this is that oems were pushing back production and so ultimately this year was a little bit different and a big part of it was the fact that this ramp up that s going on at lowe s where the oems and then also remember we do pressure washers and generators under craftsman at lowe s and so ultimately what you saw was preparation for what we expect to be a really robust launch of craftsman at lowe s and so the last thing i think anybody wants to do is be short at inventory when this with the kind of marketing dollars and the kind of splash that lowe s and others will be making for that brand transition so ultimately that s the biggest piece of what you saw come through in q2 josh chan private investor ok that makes sense and then on the guidance for the second half it sounds like engine production is going to come down so can you just talk about the level of confidence that you can hold margins kind of flat to up which is what seems to be implied by the guidance in the second half mark schwertfeger chief financial officer i think it s a little bit different between segments from a standpoint of with engine taking out the sort of production contemplated in the third order that would have a pretty significant margin impact unfavorable year over year but it s the right thing to do i mean could be as much as 150 basis points to take out that much volume which is 15 in the quarter which is almost as much as we took out of the first two quarters alone but it s the right thing to do from a working capital perspective in a year like this on the other side within our product segment we anticipate some nice growth in the third quarter because the product segment is a little less augured in on europe as well as a little bit less from a sears perspective because of our focus we placed on our independent dealer channel for that business and so you can see the margin lift and a nice revenue growth in the product segment offsetting some of the headwind the near term headwind in the engine business josh chan private investor all right and then the last question mark i guess on free cash flow for the year we had been thinking that it would be a modestly positive number but the first half is quite a use and so just kind of talking about what kind of cash flow you think you can generate for the year thanks mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes i think the biggest thing that s going to come down to how we can manage our inventory levels as we go to the back half of the year which is why we re taking the actions we are from an engine perspective we do believe that it ll probably be fairly tight on free cash flow for the fiscal year when you take a look at where ebitda would check out what the revised forecast such that we could be pretty flat from a pretty quick cash flow perspective to just modestly negative we would anticipate that rebounding quite a bit as we would go into fiscal year 20 as we start to sunset the business optimization investments and then keep our capital spending in check at around 65 million and begin to garner more benefits from the business optimization program josh chan private investor all right thanks guys for the color and good luck in the second half todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thanks mark schwertfeger chief financial officer thanks josh operator your next question comes from the line of josh wilson your line is now open josh wilson graham partners analyst good morning mark and todd this is josh filling in for sam darkats thanks for taking my questions todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning josh wilson graham partners analyst a few for me here first the impacts in the service distribution center could you give us some more specificity on what the issues were and what the progress is on resolving them todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes so what happened josh is we basically went live with with sfp in july and we did an extensive amount of testing but the thing that is probably most complicated in our business has to do with our service part centers there s tens of thousands of parts in a lot of different permutations so as we as we went live we worked through some of the issues and then we had to make a few changes as to how we process some of the pics if you will so we picked throughout the warehouse so we made some changes there and so what s happened is we ve made tremendous progress here over the last quarter or so over the last three months and and now we re we believe we re at a point where we ll be just fine here for the upcoming season arguably then there s going to be some restock that s going to happen here back half of the year because inventory levels are lower at our distributors and dealers than we would like them to be and so that s why it was really important to get the flow of the materials through the distribution center where they needed to be and we believe we re there josh wilson graham partners analyst good glad to hear that and then a few regarding sears just confirm for me again the 30 million is that the entirety of the serious exposure is there some potential further downside depending on how this unfolds mark schwertfeger chief financial officer no that s not the full amount of sales that we contemplated to sears in fiscal 19 we commented last year that our full amount of sales or last quarter we commented that our full sales are less than 3 of our total outlook of the year so it s a little bit more than that it really is under the assumption that some of the volume that would ve shopped at sears stores in the year will go elsewhere in this first year and then in subsequent years we d see more of that volume rebound in other locations as consumers migrated from where they typically shopped in the past due to new outlets josh wilson graham partners analyst and how long do you think it will take for some of the 30 million to come back for the channel to settle out again mark schwertfeger chief financial officer difficult to say i think the inventory liquidation piece associated with closed stores that one should bounce back pretty quickly as you think about that next year and then we believe that a consumer conversion happened fairly rapidly from a standpoint of the craftsman brand is now so available at locations outside of sears which is really helpful but it s difficult to say precisely when the volume would return other than to say we expect to see a lot of the headwind abate even as early as 2020 for us josh wilson graham partners analyst got it good luck with the next quarter todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mark schwertfeger chief financial officer thanks josh operator your next question comes from the line of joe mondillo your line is now open joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst hi guys just a couple of follow up questions could you provide any more color or detail on where the additional saving is coming from regarding the business op plan mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes i didn t mentioned in the comment it s really several aspects if you think about just getting further along in the program where now that we have our erp upgrade live we re starting to discover more and more of the process benefits to light at the same time we also have now our vanguard production up and running in our u s plants and a lot of production going into our new ferris plant and all of the early signs we ve seen have been really promising such that we re able to modestly increase what we think our outlook is for the program savings joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok so it s sort of across the board in terms of the three biggest buckets that are coming from the op plan mark schwertfeger chief financial officer that s right joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok and then just on how much could you can you quantify how much of the benefits we ve seen of that 35 million to 40 million how much have we sort of gotten finish with or seen and when you say by 21 fiscal 2021 will there be any benefits in fiscal 2021 or are all the benefits are going to completely seen in fiscal 20 and by fiscal 20 that s really it mark schwertfeger chief financial officer we continue to expect to earn about 6 million to 8 million of benefits in the back half of fiscal 2019 we really haven t recognized many to date because the program has been ongoing in many regards so now that we re starting to get to that pace where things are live and the like in the plants as well as with erp we expect to begin realizing the benefits and then the remaining portion of the benefits we expect to earn somewhat ratably between fiscal 20 and fiscal 21 such by at the end of 21 we would be up to that full savings rate joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok great and then looking at the balance sheet how much of that do you think just given the sort of free cash flow estimates that you sort of provided are you going to use most of that free cash flow to try to bring down that debt in the back half or just how much that do you think you can bring down in the back half mark schwertfeger chief financial officer i think it s probable that our the borrowing level will be a little bit higher than it was at the end of the last year but we do believe that the borrowing level will be substantially lower at the end of the year than it is now as we seasonally collect from the upcoming two quarters i also mentioned that there s two things at the end of the second quarter that impacted where we were from our borrowing level one of which was some of the pre buying we did on inventories to facilitate our plant transitions as well as the pre buy a little bit ahead of what we expected to be some of the tariff rate increases in the early part of calendar 2019 and then the second piece was our sales in the second quarter were somewhat weighted toward the back of the quarter such that accounts receivable was elevated quite a bit year over year in all collectible in our estimation as we get into q3 which should be beneficial from a debt and cash flow perspective joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok great and then the d a i m just wondering with what s going on at the ferris facility and i guess the vanguard facility and maybe even erp i don t know how that s sort of accounted for but the d a levels should that be sort of consistent going forward or that climb or decline actually potentially mark schwertfeger chief financial officer i think it s pretty consistently such that depreciation would largely offset capital spending of around 65 million a year joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok so at the current levels i guess it should be remain around the current levels some 16 3 million roughly mark schwertfeger chief financial officer that s right with maybe a little bit joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok ok and why is the next thing i was going to ask was the capex why is the capex not shouldn t it fall a little bit because you re spending on the ferris facility capitalizing certain things wouldn t it fall on next year or no mark schwertfeger chief financial officer no we re are just what working on prioritizing the most important things to advance our strategy was the 65 million in capital spending that we have allotted for in 2019 as we get into 2020 we expect to have other funding needs as well that we need to get to in order to support the strategy more so from a product basis and things like that less major initiative the other thing too is both the vanguard project and the ferris project we ve been able to do fairly in a fairly capital unintensive manner because if you think about especially with the vanguard area we re using our existing footprint we re not adding square footage joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst great ok yes that s why i was sort of maybe thinking i think square footage is declining right or anyways the last question i just had was related to sort of the macro consumer just wondering sort of we ve seen housing data in the u s continue to trend pretty weak europe economies the pmis just came out today those were pretty weak itself just wondering if you could sort of comment on the consumer how you re sort of thinking about that baking that in your guidance just in terms of the macro market both in the u s and europe todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes so you look at joe the north america or u s primarily yes housing has ticked down a bit but remember i mean the housing market for us especially in the lower end there is still a lot of demand out there and so the question is when will it ultimately turn where there s a lot more supply and that will be helpful to us but so we ve been we ve seen that part of the market down pretty substantially over the last several years now if the higher end of the market continues to rotate and that s where you re starting to see some weakness perhaps we still think that the commercial do it for me is perhaps more driven by people willing to trade money for time than anything else and so we would expect that to be fairly robust and so yes housing has driven our business in the past we ve been very clear on that but when you look at the impacts sequentially from where we ve been it s still not where it would return to normal and so it s a little bit we don t know if there s significant downdrafts when you look at europe europe is interesting because the biggest impact we saw was ultimately the weather but assuming that the drought you saw the snow and everything else they got over there assuming that it s a more normal spring we re still pretty encouraged by what s going to happen because even though there s an economic downturn you still have to cut your grass and so ultimately i would tell you that we don t have significant growth in our model because it s just that wouldn t be prudent but we didn t put a significant downsize the model other than what we ve already talked to you about because i think that has a tendency to mute some of the economic impacts as well joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok great thank you todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brett reese your line is now open unidentified speaker yes hi thanks for taking my question with so many balls up in the air and these turbulence you re navigating through how committed do you think the board is going to be in maintaining the dividend todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer we there has been no discussion of taking a dividend down we re very committed to holding the dividend we want to get back to growing the dividend but basically i we don t talk about taking the dividend down because still cash flow just fine the last couple of years have been interesting because we continue to invest in the business but i would tell you that we ve not had any discussion with regards to taking the dividend down unidentified speaker great thanks for answering the question operator we don t have any other questions at this time sir please continue todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer well thank you very much for joining today s conference call our next quarterly earnings call will be held in

but don t try to tell them that their solutions always focus on making the greedy government richer and more powerful for them it is always about taking away from the private sector instead of expanding it socialist rep alexandria ocasio cortez wants a 70 top federal tax rate on the rich which wouldn t raise much money think of how much the rich would have left over to invest after they paid the 70 along with all their other taxes in ocasio cortez s home state the top tax rate is 8 82 and new york city has a top rate of 3 86 you can see that at the links here new york city collects its own income taxes in addition to those collected by the state the city s tax rates range from 3 078 of taxable income to 3 876 for top earners after the rich pay up to 82 68 in income taxes under the ocasio cortez plan they could pay their property taxes carbon taxes payroll taxes motor fuel taxes and all the other government taxes and fees then with the leftover money they could invest and create jobs what a wonderful economy we would have and the ignorant ocasio cortez is not the only one with such bad ideas the very rich sen elizabeth warren d mass proposes a wealth tax that of course would not hit her maybe someday people could tell warren and others that most of the richest 1 5 and 10 in the united states today were not that rich so long ago so the statement that the rich are getting richer is completely misleading the true statement is that the economy is getting richer which allows people to move up the economic ladder for example twenty years ago jeff bezos mark zuckerburg and the owners of google including their workers were not rich but now they are capitalism is a wonderful thing now that we are on the topic come to think of it other people who are very rich today and who were not that rich twenty years ago include the obamas the clintons and harry reid i would not mind a wealth tax or high income tax on politicians who got rich because they were powerful politicians the policies democrats espouse would certainly make the areas around washington d c richer perhaps here s the data census bureau 5 richest counties are d c suburbs the five richest counties in the united states when measured by median household income are all suburbs of washington d c according to the american community survey data released today by the census bureau yet the fact remains that essentially they produce nothing except rules regulations and taxes for the rest of us politicians have already made five counties around d c the richest counties in america now here come the democrats who explicitly want to expand that particular wealth gap there is one sure way to reduce the wealth gap in the united states and democrat policies would almost surely make that happen the solution would be to have the economy collapse real estate stocks and commodities would decline rapidly in price and that would certainly make the richest people poorer but i fail to see how that would help the poor and the middle class whom democrats all pretend they want to help a great example of an economy collapsing is venezuela where socialist policies and a powerful government have caused pure misery why would we want to emulate socialist policies in cuba the castros became billionaires but the powerful government free health care and free education has certainly not helped the people move up the economic ladder president obama s eight years of government continually taking away power and money from the people gave us the slowest economic recovery in seventy years why do journalists support policies that gave us slow growth despite almost zero interest rates that punished savers why is the media bragging about house speaker nancy pelosi schooling president trump while holding federal workers hostage all because she refuses to give a small amount of money for a border barrier that she supported not so long ago it appears that these democrats want the economy to slow a piece of great news came out yesterday unemployment claims were down to 199 000 which is a fifty year low despite the shutdown the jobs picture is phenomenal and to put the unemployment claims in perspective the labor force was less than half the size in 1969 as it is today instead of focusing on the good economic news which includes the record low unemployment especially for minorities and less educated workers or holiday sales or nominal wages going up faster than any time during obama s eight years or continued low inflation or rising exports or low oil prices because of increased production journalists in collusion with democrats are trying to talk the economy down because that is how they would get democrats elected in 2020 the goal of journalists along with other democrats is to win at all costs they would rather have more people dependent on government than give them the chance to move up the economic ladder those are disastrous goals for our long term freedom and health especially for the poor and middle class

us dollar tumbles as focus turns to fed policy meeting reuters new york the us dollar fell on friday from its three week highs in the previous session as traders focus shifted to the us federal reserve s policy meeting next week when the us central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged while the fed next week may not sound overtly dovish its tone might emphasize caution and thus do little to alter very low expectations for policymakers to raise rates this year said joe manimbo senior market analyst at western union business solutions in washington the fed raised interest rates four times last year and has signaled it will probably lift borrowing costs twice this year although some central bank officials have said they will be patient in raising rates in taipei the new taiwan dollar rose against the us dollar adding nt 0 060 to close at nt 30 825 little changed from last week s nt 30 841 in mid morning trading on friday the us dollar index was down 0 6 percent at 96 046 after climbing to a three week high of 96 676 on thursday it ended friday down 0 8 percent at 95 81 posting a weekly loss of 0 5 percent the us dollar s decline also coincided with a rally in us stocks which were bolstered by upbeat earnings the euro on the other hand rebounded on friday steadying after a dovish european central bank president mario draghi failed to alter an already downbeat assessment on the eurozone s economy draghi on thursday said that a dip in the eurozone s economy could be more pronounced than thought a few weeks ago comments seen as signaling a delay in the bank s first interest rate hike the euro on thursday weakened broadly on those comments and fell to a two month low of us 1 1286 against the us dollar however on friday the single currency recovered rising 0 7 percent to us 1 1379 a relatively dovish performance from draghi was already priced in said john hardy head of foreign exchange strategy at saxo bank a s the euro has traded in a range of us 1 12 to us 1 16 for the past three months and analysts expect it to underperform in the near term as monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative for now sterling reached an 11 week high on friday after a report in the sun newspaper that northern ireland s democratic unionist party had privately decided to offer conditional backing for british prime minister theresa may s brexit deal next week the report pushed the pound 0 4 percent higher to us 1 3139 its highest level since nov 9 last year sterling has risen about 1 8 percent this week moving above us 1 30 to the us dollar on hopes britain will avoid a no deal brexit on march 29 additional reporting by cna
revenge of the us millennials us democrats major economic initiatives tend to favor the young at the expense of the old by karl w smith bloomberg opinion almost every major new economic initiative proposed by democrats the green new deal medicare for all debt free college has a common feature unlike most social programs it would benefit younger americans at the expense of older americans since the new deal the us social insurance programs have primarily transferred resources from the relatively young to the old social security was designed as a program to support those unable to work but over time its spending came to be dominated by payments to retirees medicaid was intended for the poor but now mostly pays for medical care for lower income older americans medicare has always been focused on serving senior citizens true healthcare spending tends to go toward older americans anyway but these programs are prone to letting younger americans fall through the cracks last year the uninsured rate for americans overall was 8 8 percent but for americans aged 26 to 34 it was 16 2 percent medicare for all would represent a much larger expansion of health insurance among younger adults than among older adults with a corresponding increase in costs these costs would have to be made up with higher taxes or more likely reductions in services for those who currently have medicare likewise the young have the most to gain from a green new deal first and most obviously they are likely to live long enough to reap the benefits of any impact it might have in mitigating the effects of climate change second and more immediately the green new deal is likely to create jobs in the development and installation of renewable energy technology both the technical skills and the physical labor required for this work are likely to come disproportionately from the young the argument that a debt free college policy would mostly benefit the young hardly needs an explanation yet it is even more skewed toward them than it appears it is not a given that such a program would result in many more americans going to college if that happened the overall benefits from the increase in skilled workers would be widespread instead more students would leave college without owing tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt that reduced debt burden represents a direct transfer from older americans to younger ones none of this is to argue against the goals of these democratic proposals but they represent a radical departure from the past and present model it is interesting to consider why they are all being introduced now my favorite theory and that is all it is is that they are payback for decades of pro elderly monetary policy if you bought a house or started investing in stocks and bonds in the late 1970s or early 1980s you probably did pretty well at the time interest rates were high at their peak in october 1981 the average home mortgage rate was 18 5 percent high interest rates tend to push down the value of the underlying asset so while interest payments on homes might have been exorbitant the principle was relatively small these high interest rates were designed to reduce inflation and they worked however as inflation fell so did interest rates and in response asset prices soared that means that houses as well as stocks bonds and other assets that americans of that generation bought went up in value with the new lower interest rates many homeowners could refinance and save even more those low interest rates made student debt look less daunting so numerous states allowed their university systems to raise tuition in many cases the rationale was that the students paying full price would subsidize aid for lower income students all those paying customers radically changed incentives for universities instead of focusing on academics they spent lavishly on administrative staff campus renovations and amenities largely in an effort to improve the student experience however upon graduation students found that their more expensive educations had not brought them more lucrative job opportunities the same monetary policy that pushed down inflation also reduced job growth particularly for entry level workers college students were entering a subpar job market with an above par amount of debt it seems that they have finally had enough they want to use fiscal policy to help repair the damage wrought by monetary policy this is not necessarily the way that i would address the issue i would argue for fixing monetary policy instead of spending vast additional sums to support a new suite of government entitlements but i am certainly sympathetic toward those who think otherwise karl w smith is a senior fellow at the niskanen center and founder of the blog modeled behavior this column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or bloomberg lp and its owners

questions include forward looking statements these statements are based on our current assessment of the markets in which we operate actual results could differ materially from any stated or implied projections due to changes in one or more of the factors described in the safe harbor section of yesterday s earnings release as well as our filings with the sec we ll also make reference to certain non gaap financial measures during today s call additional information regarding these financial measures including reconciliations to comparable u s more from the motley fool gaap amounts is available in our earnings release and in our sec filings this conference call will be made available on our website or by phone replay approximately two hours after the end of this call now here s todd todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today yesterday briggs reported robust second quarter sales growth of 13 on strength across multiple dimensions of our business both business segments engines power and products contributed to this result in both residential and commercial categories for the fiscal second quarter we delivered adjusted eps of 0 20 per share adjusted gross margins were lower in the second quarter due to lower engine production some operational inefficiencies primarily driven by lower throughput in our service distribution center hub and sales mix we made great strides during the quarter toward improving our service parts distribution capabilities and this business is now well positioned as we enter the peak selling season at the same time we announced a revision to our outlook to reflect near term headwinds related to two issues the effects of prolonged severe drought in australia and europe and the sears bankruptcy combined and including the partial offset from incremental storm related sales we re reducing our annual sales outlook by approximately 50 million and earnings by 0 30 per diluted share i d like to provide some context to the revision in the fiscal first in the fiscal 2019 first quarter we projected that u s generator sales related to hurricanes florence and michael would offset the weather headwinds in australia and europe we recently recently concluded that the australia and europe weather conditions are likely to be more impactful than previously estimated specifically the drought in australia did not abate in time for the growing season to recover and our second quarter sales in the region were lower than expected in europe where the market is significantly more fragmented than in the u s we received more input from channel partners throughout the second quarter and learned that the historic heat and drought conditions from this past season resulted in channel inventory levels that were more elevated than previously estimated regarding sears as we previewed last quarter we believe that the bankruptcy caused some disruption during the upcoming lawn and garden season in the u s accordingly we adjusted our outlook to account for store closures and lower channel inventory stocking we expect that much of this market disruption will ease by next season as consumers migrate their shopping patterns and adjust to this change in the retail landscape despite the near term market headwinds we ll make every effort to offset the challenges we highlighted during the remainder of our fiscal year we remain confident in our long term strategy to grow sales and profitability and are pleased that commercial sales growth remains very solid and on track for the year in addition with line reviews for the upcoming season now complete i m pleased to report that we maintained our industry leading engine placement at the major retailers especially given the significant brand transitions that retail this season in particular we are very proud to continue our long tradition of powering craftsman branded products and are eager to help support our channel partners as this iconic brand has launched at lowe s this spring for a lawn and garden homeowner shopping for lawn mowers this season including craftsman branded models will find our engines very well represented equally encouraging is the exceptional progress made in building our commercial business the quarter commercial sales were up more than 20 or approximately 30 million year to date commercial sales have increased over 17 and we are well on track to achieve very strong growth for the year while all parts of commercial performed well commercial engines in job site stood out both advancing more than 30 in the quarter vanguard commercial engines are powering more applications than ever before with higher quality durability and reliability than the competition our commercial engines are making substantial share gains in lawn and garden equipment construction equipment and storm related applications an important element of this success has been offering new products that improve productivity and uptime for contractors to date this fiscal year we ve expanded business with more than 20 current customers and secured business with about as many new customers we have been more demanding more product powered by vanguard engines through rental houses distributors we are pleased with the success of this multiyear strategy in which there is still considerable opportunity for the growth business diversification is also benefiting job site with a broader range of products and stronger distribution we are now serving applications in entertainment infrastructure and general rental in addition to our traditional base in oil and gas and construction with a full business pipeline we announced the facility expansion for our job site business to increase production capacity and improve productivity and speed to market expansion includes new modern assembly lines a prototyping lab to assist customers on product configuration a new paint system and efficient robotic welding cells expansion is scheduled for completion by the end of calendar 2019 operationally we ve made significant progress on our business optimization program the onshoring of commercial engines is proceeding on plan with the production of vanguard engines ramping up on schedule at our auburn alabama plant customers are recognizing the high quality of the engines produced at the plant and appreciate the faster delivery times attention has now turned to our statesboro georgia plant which began production of vanguard engines in late december and is expected to reach full production by the end of this fiscal year also in the second quarter we made all the necessary preparations to enable the remaining production of various commercial mowers to shift to our new facility in upstate new york early in the third quarter located only a few miles from our older outdated facility the new manufacturing site doubles production capacity and improves throughput commercial turf has been on a steady upward trajectory for several years and the new ferris facility gives us the production capacity needed to support further growth we also made significant progress in the quarter with the upgrade of our erp system in addition to the improvements that are benefiting our service parts distribution throughput we continue to make strides across the organization in adapting to streamline processes and new tools taken together we now estimate that our business optimization program will deliver pre tax savings of 35 million to 40 million by 2021 up from our previous estimate of 30 million to 35 million the incremental improvement comes primarily from higher than planned efficiencies we expect to achieve from several aspects of the program we are well on track with our strategic priorities and i am proud of our team which has driven the great progress made today at our challenging market conditions and here is mark to walk you through our financial results for the fiscal 2019 second quarter and provide details on the earnings revision mark schwertfeger chief financial officer thanks todd i ll begin by touching on some highlights from the financial results second quarter gaap consolidated net loss of 2 6 million included 10 7 million in business optimization pre tax cost 200 000 premiums paid on the repurchase of senior notes and 200 000 on acquisition integration pre tax costs the net loss also includes a onetime tax charge of 1 1 million related to finalizing estimates on the inclusion of foreign earnings related to the implementation of u s tax reform excluding these items fiscal 2019 second quarter adjusted net income was 8 4 million or 0 20 per diluted share a decrease from 10 7 million or 0 25 per diluted share a year ago the engine segment incurred approximately 7 5 million dollars of the pre tax business optimization costs and the product segment incurred the remaining 3 2 million as well as the acquisition integration cost engine segment sales for the second quarter were 272 million an increase of 29 million or 12 engine unit sales increased by 17 or approximately 274 000 engines on the strength of shipments for commercial applications and timing of shipments for residential applications due to several factors including our erp upgrade go live approximately 15 million of sales shifted from the first quarter to the second in addition sales of approximately 20 million were accelerated from the third quarter for customers in north america to begin production earlier than last year sales of service parts increased year over year by over 6 million in the quarter due to reduced throughput of our distribution center hub we experienced a steady improvement in throughput throughout the second quarter from the improvements we drove that todd commented on earlier international sales decreased in the quarter due to weather related softness in europe and australia the engine segment adjusted gross profit margin was 20 7 which was down from 23 1 last year the decrease was largely driven by lower manufacturing volumes unfavorable sales mix of approximately 100 basis points and inefficiencies from lower throughput in our service distribution centers higher pricing largely offset higher material costs including tariffs engine production volume in the quarter was 1 2 million units which was 7 lower than the second quarter last year total engine inventories at the end of the quarter were approximately 2 1 million units which is a decrease of approximately 230 000 units from the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 the decrease largely came in small engines which is why engine inventory dollars are consistent year over year we continue to anticipate that fiscal 2019 year end engine inventory dollars will be lower than at the end of fiscal 2018 engine segment adjusted esg a held relatively steady with a decrease in the second quarter of 2019 by approximately 1 million from year ago largely due to lower variable compensation adjusted segment income for engines was 12 2 million up from 10 7 million last year product segment net sales for the second quarter increased by 15 or 33 million to 255 million the increase was largely driven by higher pressure washer sales and growth in sales of allmand commercial job site products ferris commercial mowers and the hurricane acquisition which added stand on blowers to our product portfolio product segment adjusted gross profit margin decreased from 17 to 15 largely due to sales mix and manufacturing inefficiency the sales mix was a result of lower storm generator sales because of a less active hurricane season this year compared to a year ago and timing of product mix within both residential and commercial offerings higher pricing offset increases in material costs including tariffs products segment adjusted esg a expenses increased by approximately 2 million or 7 this year due to higher employee compensation costs and higher commission expense on increased sales volume on the balance sheet net debt at the end of the second fiscal quarter was approximately 476 million which was 191 million higher than a year ago the increase is primarily due to last year s discretionary pension contribution of 30 million investments in the business optimization program and higher working capital amounts following the suboptimal lawn and garden season last year we also increased inventory purchases from china in the prior prior to quarter end to take advantage of lower tariff costs last 12 month cash used by operating activities was 58 million which was largely due to the factors that resulted in higher net debt second quarter sales were weighted toward the end of the quarter which resulted in elevated accounts receivable that will be collected early in the third quarter inventory dollars at the end of the second quarter were also elevated both to facilitate the plant transitions and progress for vanguard engines and ferris mowers and lower than planned sales in australia from the drought conditions there last 12 months free cash flow was a negative 150 million with capital expenditures totaling 92 million over the period for the quarter depreciation and amortization of 16 million was higher than capital expenditures of 13 million which are trending down following the bulk of expenditures related to our business optimization program year to date capital spending is down 11 million or over 25 and we expect capital spending of approximately 65 million for fiscal 2019 regarding the business optimization program we now estimate achieving up to 40 million in pre tax savings by 2021 we also estimate that pre tax charges related to the program will be 60 million to 70 million up from our initial estimate of 50 to 55 million total program charges incurred to date through the second quarter were 52 million or approximately 80 of total expected program charges the increase is primarily related to costs associated with the go liveof our upgraded erp at the end of the quarter last 12 month average funded debt was 382 million and last 12 month ebitda was 147 million both as defined by our credit agreements resulting in a leverage ratio of 2 6 times which is well within our debt covenants before i turn the call back over to todd for his closing remarks i want to offer some further insights into our updated fiscal 2019 outlook there were three primary reasons for the revised guidance which todd commented on earlier first we are adjusting our outlook for the sears holdings bankruptcy this past season sears full line stores covered approximately 500 locations and represented a little over 10 of the residential lawn and garden market in the u s should sears emerge from bankruptcy it is expected to operate less than half the stores that were in place last season it is also unknown what products the remaining stores will offer and how frequently consumers will visit the stores we continue to believe that sears channel inventory is low but liquidation of inventory from closed stores is likely to cause some market disruptions in addition we expect that a portion of consumers who previously shopped at sears will not immediately migrate to new retailers we estimate the sales impact of sears at 30 million and earnings at 0 15 per share the impact is predominantly comprised of engine and service part sales the majority of which would have been sold in during our third quarter second poor weather conditions in australia have extended beyond our original expectations and have resulted in lower overall demand in season in addition the drought in europe last summer has contributed to high inventories in the channel of engines mowers and service parts together we expect lower sales of 40 million due to weather in australia and europe of which we have incurred approximately 30 million of the decrease through december we expect the remaining amount of 10 million to largely impact the third quarter partially offsetting this is the benefit of approximately 20 million of generator sales in the first half of fiscal 2019 related to hurricanes florence and michael net we estimate these weather related items will reduce sales by approximately 20 million and eps by 0 15 lastly in order to proactively manage working capital we played the lower engine production volumes by 10 compared to last year s production volume with this change we expect third quarter production to be approximately 300 000 units or 15 lower than last year s third quarter production despite this reduction we are confident that we have adequate safety stock in plant production to meet customer demand in the back half of the year we will actively work to reduce expenses to help offset the impact of lower plant throughput through the remainder of the fiscal year partially offsetting the near term headwinds we expect the engine segment will encounter in the third quarter we anticipate robust sales growth in the third quarter within our product segment due to our focus on selling higher end commercial and residential lawn and garden equipment through our north america dealer channel now let me turn the call back over to todd for some closing remarks todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thanks mark we entered the second half of fiscal 2019 with favorable momentum in our commercial business and a stronger leading position serving the power needs of the consumer we have made great progress improving the efficiency of our part distribution business and are now well positioned as we approach the peak selling season for lawn and garden in north america at the same time we recognize the temporary headwinds caused by weather conditions in europe and australia as well as the channel related matters around sears as a result we re taking appropriate responsible actions to align production with demand to ensure adequate product availability while focusing on generating an improved cash flow stream overall briggs is in a stronger competitive position today which is a direct result of our focus on innovation and driving consumer driven power solutions expanding global channels to reach our reach more customers and diversifying into high growth commercial businesses as a result we are now in the latter stages of our business optimization program and as a result we are well positioned to drive costs lower improve working capital efficiency and deliver better returns on investment in addition to driving further profitable growth in commercial our priorities for the second half of fiscal 2019 are one focusing on executing on the upcoming lawn and garden season we are encouraged by our placement for the upcoming season and excited about the support we are seeing promoting the brand transitions two internally we will be working to manage working capital to improve cash generation we ended the second quarter with higher inventories in part to support the vanguard and ferris manufacturing transitions we are completing this year as mark commented earlier in response to lower than planned sales we intend to adjust production downward in the second half of the year to control inventories three maintaining our high level of innovation we are very pleased with the success of our commercial business which has built the foundation of offering customers demonstrably better products to maintain this momentum plans are now under way to refresh and expand our line of job site equipment which is also experiencing strong growth in commercial engines we will be launching an expanded range of horizontal engines to complement our 200 cc model which is meeting with strong customer acceptance and an important element in our success in expanding the range of power applications we serve finally we will continue to follow through on our business optimization program the third quarter transition of the remaining ferris mower production into a larger more efficient plant and our erp upgrade as well as the smooth ramp up of vanguard commercial engines brought onshore we are now nearing the end of implementing this broad based initiative financial benefits from it will begin flowing in the second half of this fiscal year with substantially further cost savings coming in fiscal 2020 and the full benefit of fiscal 2021 let me finish with a word on capital allocation we continue to evaluate the allocation of our resources to those areas that deliver the highest risk adjusted returns to date we are pleased with the value creating investments in the business optimization program in addition we look forward to the first full year s contribution from the hurricane and ground logic acquisitions which should advance our strategy of filling out the professionals trailer with innovative power equipment as we look for further investment opportunities our m a pipeline is filling with a range of bolt on acquisition opportunities that would accelerate the diversification of our business enhance long term growth and improve the overall profit profile of the company along with our investment discipline we remain mindful of ensuring that we maintain a strong balance sheet with appropriate financial leverage finally we continue to view stock repurchases as part of our investment options during the second quarter we repurchased 6 3 million of briggs shares and committed 11 4 million to stock buybacks in the year to date that concludes our prepared comments i would like to open up the call for questions questions and answers mark schwertfeger chief financial officer renz we can now open up the call to questions operator certainly sir your first question comes from the line of mr joe mondillo your line is now open joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst hi guys good morning todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning joe mark schwertfeger chief financial officer good morning joe joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst so i wanted to just touch on the guidance first off so you brought the revenue down 2 5 roughly and the eps comes down 20 so i m just curious just given what s going on we had the sears headwind which we knew about we had the weather in europe and the inventory levels there that we sort of knew about is there any other i m just wondering is there any other flexibility that we have within the business model to try to prevent such volatility and the bottom line relative to fluctuations in the top line like that mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes joe the other factors that contributes to the bottom line versus top line one is the production volume and we re doing the responsible thing from a working capital perspective in taking down the engine production as much as 500 000 units compared to what we ve talked through previously when we came out with guidance at the beginning of the year and has to keep the inventory levels in check and that has a pretty big impact on the absorption of our manufacturing facilities the second piece has to do with sales mix as well and the european and australian lawn and garden markets are a little bit different than the u s from a price point perspective and so having some headwinds there can create some margin pressure from a sales mix perspective which is what you re seeing also as part of the australia and europe as well as sears impact there is a component of service parts sales that are impacted by that reduction and those as many with many other manufacturers come at a higher margin profile relative to the whole book todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer and what i d tell you joe is that as we look forward if you think about all the things we ve done over the last few years with commercial engines and products and that sort of thing i mean that adds diversification of the business and so the business will be exposed to weather related type things whether it be hurricanes whether it be spring selling seasons whatever it is but at the end of the day when you look at commercial and our opportunities to not only grow in a higher market growth we also have the opportunity to gain share which you ve seen us do and then the margin profile is also better so i mean going forward the mix of business has changed will continue to change and but you get to these kind of transitory things whether it be the weather in the international markets or sears and they re going to have a near term impact but we re still very confident with where things are at in the long term joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok and then sort of just to transition with your comments there todd commercial doing good i mean better than even i was expecting in terms of residential side we had a really tough challenging spring last year and we were anticipating somewhat a rebound but obviously things have changed a little bit just in terms of the overall u s economy i think there s still growth there so do you have any visibility into the spring season can you talk about that and what you have sort of baked into your guidance what you re anticipating in terms of any rebound at all considering the comparison to last year todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes so when you look at what happened last year we had inventory destocking right in the channel so what was happening is with the brand transitions that were anticipated some of the retailers especially lowe s they took their inventories down because they knew they were going to bringing in craftsman this year so if you go back to a year ago it was pretty evident what was happening which is why when you look at what our guidance has been and is i mean we continue to see growth here a big part of that has to do with channel restocking and that s kind of what you saw here in q2 when you think about earlier production and earlier stocking that s why i mentioned in the prepared comments you get into the situation where we re starting to see some favorable things happen in north america lawn and garden now you got to remember too last year and you pointed out the weather wasn t it was snowing in the middle of april and whatever that happens it s starts to delay the season so i don t know what the weather forecast is going to be but at the end of the day we re feeling quite good about where the channel is going to be inventory wise and we re confident that if the season is a normal season remember we haven t had a normal season since 2015 if it s a normal season we re there to serve the market joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok great and then last question from me just in terms of engine placement could you provide any more color there it sounds like you re pretty pleased but do you have any sort of i don t know statistics or anything you also you can sort of provide regarding the engine placement mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes if you look across the board we commented that largely consistent year over year despite of the brand transition so we re particularly pleased with some of the larger engines that power riding lawn mowers and that we picked up some volume there this last year and then the other thing from an overall lineup perspective is that the major retailers we indeed expect a similar number of skus in the lineup compared to a year ago as it related to products that we power as well as the other gas engine companies power as well so those are really the encouraging things and like todd mentioned in the remarks too we ve very nice placement on the craftsman mowers at lowe s which was the big one of the big transitions coming into this upcoming year joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst so at the retailers on the residential side it sounds like sort of similar year over year are you achieving growth or more placement at the commercial side with your new engines todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes we ve seen continued upticks on the commercial side remember that doesn t that s not part of and you know this is not part of the retail channel it s really part of the dealer channel and so when you look at what we ve been able to do i think we ve got 20 new at least somewhere around 20 new customers this year and then the customers that we ve had we re seeing increased placements that s why you re seeing such tremendous growth in that commercial engine business because the people who are expecting our engines are continuing to do more and more of that joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst great thanks a lot todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mark schwertfeger chief financial officer thanks joe operator your next question comes from the line of tom hayes your line is now open tom hayes northcoast research analyst thanks good morning gentlemen todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer hi tom mark schwertfeger chief financial officer hi tom tom hayes northcoast research analyst todd i was wondering maybe it sounds like you re having great success in the commercial segment specifically with vanguard just maybe help us update the total opportunity you see there and kind of maybe where you are as a share position right now todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes so when you look at kind of share it s a very large market so we have a tendency to break the share down a little bit in terms of different segments and so if you think tom where we ve been if you think about where we ve been playing here as of late it s in that commercial turf space it s been a big piece although there s a lot of other applications that we ve been powering and so when you look at the commercial side our share is substantially lower than it would be for example on the residential side which is part of the reason you re seeing the tremendous growth in commercial engine so think about it this way if the market in these commercial areas generally go grow at about 2 time gdp we ve got substantially let s say it s about 2 5 3 we also have a 5 growth we re seeing substantially higher growth than that which means we re taking share but i would tell you we still have a fair amount of ways to fair ways to go in terms of the ability to take share and continue growth in that area and then on top of that i would tell you that on the vanguard v twin side where we re going to auburn and statesboro there s a lot of other applications that are out there that we can now really participate in and it s little bit more nichey but actually they re really good segments for us and they re really interesting things like mud boats powering mud boats and things like that where people actually go out and use the equipment to have fun so there s a whole aspect there and then when you look at the horizontal shaft we still have a very very low share in the horizontal think of single cylinder horizontal shaft market vanguard engines we ve got 200 cc we re coming out with 400 we ll have a 300 and 160 following so as we continue to broaden out that product offering on the single cylinder side there s some tremendous opportunities out there and so we re still encouraged because we think there are ways to go with the market growth but even probably more impactful is really opportunities to get new and more market share tom hayes northcoast research analyst ok great i appreciate the color just wanted to follow up i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks todd that the rental equipment market was holding up well i just wanted to kind of circle back and make sure i heard that right todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes we ve been doing very well on the rental equipment market and we ve been keeping a close eye on that to just to understand what some of the capex requirements will be now as we get into calendar 2019 and we re still seeing it hold up really pretty well there s obviously always noise around various aspects of that but overall we think that the we make great strides because we d be able to gain share so should a market turn down a bit we think we have more opportunities though because our share is pretty low and we can go and take share overall though i will tell you what we re hearing from the channel is that capex levels aren t going to drop dramatically they re going to be either flat to slightly up tom hayes northcoast research analyst ok i appreciate it and then mark i think you mentioned that 80 of the business optimization expenses have been occurred earlier in the first half of the year i mean should the balance be then split equally over the back half of the year or should most be done in 3q mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes my comment was actually 80 of the program cost to date but that also includes some in 2018 and so indeed if you were to expect quite a bit of deceleration in the back half of the year of expenditures of say roughly another 10 million or so to 15 million and indeed that would be fairly split between quarters tom hayes northcoast research analyst appreciate it thanks for the color operator your next question comes from the line of josh chan your line is now open josh chan private investor hi good morning todd and mark todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning josh josh chan private investor hi good morning yes thanks for the color on the guidance related to weather i just wanted to ask about the sears piece of it is it fair to assume that that reduction comes out primarily in the second half and are you basically assuming that not much sales goes into that channel for the year basically mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes we actually believe that most of the impact will be in the third quarter because that s typically when the market would load up sears or other retailers to be prepared for the season and at this point in time there s just a lot of uncertainty as to whether sears will merge and how it will merge and so therefore we do think that that impact will be back half and mainly q3 todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes josh let me just even a little bit more color so if you think about the inventory stock up that would normally happen because their hearing isn t until the first week of february you which again they ve kind of missed the stock up because normally store set start in the south about now and then they work their way up and so we just don t think that they re going to have the kind of inventory stocking they would otherwise have especially given fewer stores then you think about they have very low inventory we believe we don t have full visibility but we believe low inventory at the dc level but they ll use that inventory then to stock up the existing stores should they emerge from bankruptcy and but ultimately what it comes back to is what kind of then will the consumers there s less points of light out there how will they adjust and so ultimately we believe that it really is more q3 and because they will take whatever inventory they have and then try to sell that out and then quite honestly the oems i don t know that the oems i know they re not building for sears right now the question is when will they slot them in for production should they emerge from bankruptcy so there s just a lot of moving pieces around the sears situation which is why we took the tack we did and expect that in q3 where we ll see most of the impact josh chan private investor ok yes appreciate the color there i think that definitely makes sense and then on the on the pull ahead that you saw in north america could why do you think that is and do you think it s related to tariff s price increases or that craftsman outside of sears weld in in q2 why did you see that pull ahead in the quarter todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes so what happened is if you go back through the last few years you kind of alluded to this is that oems were pushing back production and so ultimately this year was a little bit different and a big part of it was the fact that this ramp up that s going on at lowe s where the oems and then also remember we do pressure washers and generators under craftsman at lowe s and so ultimately what you saw was preparation for what we expect to be a really robust launch of craftsman at lowe s and so the last thing i think anybody wants to do is be short at inventory when this with the kind of marketing dollars and the kind of splash that lowe s and others will be making for that brand transition so ultimately that s the biggest piece of what you saw come through in q2 josh chan private investor ok that makes sense and then on the guidance for the second half it sounds like engine production is going to come down so can you just talk about the level of confidence that you can hold margins kind of flat to up which is what seems to be implied by the guidance in the second half mark schwertfeger chief financial officer i think it s a little bit different between segments from a standpoint of with engine taking out the sort of production contemplated in the third order that would have a pretty significant margin impact unfavorable year over year but it s the right thing to do i mean could be as much as 150 basis points to take out that much volume which is 15 in the quarter which is almost as much as we took out of the first two quarters alone but it s the right thing to do from a working capital perspective in a year like this on the other side within our product segment we anticipate some nice growth in the third quarter because the product segment is a little less augured in on europe as well as a little bit less from a sears perspective because of our focus we placed on our independent dealer channel for that business and so you can see the margin lift and a nice revenue growth in the product segment offsetting some of the headwind the near term headwind in the engine business josh chan private investor all right and then the last question mark i guess on free cash flow for the year we had been thinking that it would be a modestly positive number but the first half is quite a use and so just kind of talking about what kind of cash flow you think you can generate for the year thanks mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes i think the biggest thing that s going to come down to how we can manage our inventory levels as we go to the back half of the year which is why we re taking the actions we are from an engine perspective we do believe that it ll probably be fairly tight on free cash flow for the fiscal year when you take a look at where ebitda would check out what the revised forecast such that we could be pretty flat from a pretty quick cash flow perspective to just modestly negative we would anticipate that rebounding quite a bit as we would go into fiscal year 20 as we start to sunset the business optimization investments and then keep our capital spending in check at around 65 million and begin to garner more benefits from the business optimization program josh chan private investor all right thanks guys for the color and good luck in the second half todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thanks mark schwertfeger chief financial officer thanks josh operator your next question comes from the line of josh wilson your line is now open josh wilson graham partners analyst good morning mark and todd this is josh filling in for sam darkats thanks for taking my questions todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning josh wilson graham partners analyst a few for me here first the impacts in the service distribution center could you give us some more specificity on what the issues were and what the progress is on resolving them todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes so what happened josh is we basically went live with with sfp in july and we did an extensive amount of testing but the thing that is probably most complicated in our business has to do with our service part centers there s tens of thousands of parts in a lot of different permutations so as we as we went live we worked through some of the issues and then we had to make a few changes as to how we process some of the pics if you will so we picked throughout the warehouse so we made some changes there and so what s happened is we ve made tremendous progress here over the last quarter or so over the last three months and and now we re we believe we re at a point where we ll be just fine here for the upcoming season arguably then there s going to be some restock that s going to happen here back half of the year because inventory levels are lower at our distributors and dealers than we would like them to be and so that s why it was really important to get the flow of the materials through the distribution center where they needed to be and we believe we re there josh wilson graham partners analyst good glad to hear that and then a few regarding sears just confirm for me again the 30 million is that the entirety of the serious exposure is there some potential further downside depending on how this unfolds mark schwertfeger chief financial officer no that s not the full amount of sales that we contemplated to sears in fiscal 19 we commented last year that our full amount of sales or last quarter we commented that our full sales are less than 3 of our total outlook of the year so it s a little bit more than that it really is under the assumption that some of the volume that would ve shopped at sears stores in the year will go elsewhere in this first year and then in subsequent years we d see more of that volume rebound in other locations as consumers migrated from where they typically shopped in the past due to new outlets josh wilson graham partners analyst and how long do you think it will take for some of the 30 million to come back for the channel to settle out again mark schwertfeger chief financial officer difficult to say i think the inventory liquidation piece associated with closed stores that one should bounce back pretty quickly as you think about that next year and then we believe that a consumer conversion happened fairly rapidly from a standpoint of the craftsman brand is now so available at locations outside of sears which is really helpful but it s difficult to say precisely when the volume would return other than to say we expect to see a lot of the headwind abate even as early as 2020 for us josh wilson graham partners analyst got it good luck with the next quarter todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mark schwertfeger chief financial officer thanks josh operator your next question comes from the line of joe mondillo your line is now open joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst hi guys just a couple of follow up questions could you provide any more color or detail on where the additional saving is coming from regarding the business op plan mark schwertfeger chief financial officer yes i didn t mentioned in the comment it s really several aspects if you think about just getting further along in the program where now that we have our erp upgrade live we re starting to discover more and more of the process benefits to light at the same time we also have now our vanguard production up and running in our u s plants and a lot of production going into our new ferris plant and all of the early signs we ve seen have been really promising such that we re able to modestly increase what we think our outlook is for the program savings joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok so it s sort of across the board in terms of the three biggest buckets that are coming from the op plan mark schwertfeger chief financial officer that s right joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok and then just on how much could you can you quantify how much of the benefits we ve seen of that 35 million to 40 million how much have we sort of gotten finish with or seen and when you say by 21 fiscal 2021 will there be any benefits in fiscal 2021 or are all the benefits are going to completely seen in fiscal 20 and by fiscal 20 that s really it mark schwertfeger chief financial officer we continue to expect to earn about 6 million to 8 million of benefits in the back half of fiscal 2019 we really haven t recognized many to date because the program has been ongoing in many regards so now that we re starting to get to that pace where things are live and the like in the plants as well as with erp we expect to begin realizing the benefits and then the remaining portion of the benefits we expect to earn somewhat ratably between fiscal 20 and fiscal 21 such by at the end of 21 we would be up to that full savings rate joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok great and then looking at the balance sheet how much of that do you think just given the sort of free cash flow estimates that you sort of provided are you going to use most of that free cash flow to try to bring down that debt in the back half or just how much that do you think you can bring down in the back half mark schwertfeger chief financial officer i think it s probable that our the borrowing level will be a little bit higher than it was at the end of the last year but we do believe that the borrowing level will be substantially lower at the end of the year than it is now as we seasonally collect from the upcoming two quarters i also mentioned that there s two things at the end of the second quarter that impacted where we were from our borrowing level one of which was some of the pre buying we did on inventories to facilitate our plant transitions as well as the pre buy a little bit ahead of what we expected to be some of the tariff rate increases in the early part of calendar 2019 and then the second piece was our sales in the second quarter were somewhat weighted toward the back of the quarter such that accounts receivable was elevated quite a bit year over year in all collectible in our estimation as we get into q3 which should be beneficial from a debt and cash flow perspective joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok great and then the d a i m just wondering with what s going on at the ferris facility and i guess the vanguard facility and maybe even erp i don t know how that s sort of accounted for but the d a levels should that be sort of consistent going forward or that climb or decline actually potentially mark schwertfeger chief financial officer i think it s pretty consistently such that depreciation would largely offset capital spending of around 65 million a year joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok so at the current levels i guess it should be remain around the current levels some 16 3 million roughly mark schwertfeger chief financial officer that s right with maybe a little bit joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok ok and why is the next thing i was going to ask was the capex why is the capex not shouldn t it fall a little bit because you re spending on the ferris facility capitalizing certain things wouldn t it fall on next year or no mark schwertfeger chief financial officer no we re are just what working on prioritizing the most important things to advance our strategy was the 65 million in capital spending that we have allotted for in 2019 as we get into 2020 we expect to have other funding needs as well that we need to get to in order to support the strategy more so from a product basis and things like that less major initiative the other thing too is both the vanguard project and the ferris project we ve been able to do fairly in a fairly capital unintensive manner because if you think about especially with the vanguard area we re using our existing footprint we re not adding square footage joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst great ok yes that s why i was sort of maybe thinking i think square footage is declining right or anyways the last question i just had was related to sort of the macro consumer just wondering sort of we ve seen housing data in the u s continue to trend pretty weak europe economies the pmis just came out today those were pretty weak itself just wondering if you could sort of comment on the consumer how you re sort of thinking about that baking that in your guidance just in terms of the macro market both in the u s and europe todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yes so you look at joe the north america or u s primarily yes housing has ticked down a bit but remember i mean the housing market for us especially in the lower end there is still a lot of demand out there and so the question is when will it ultimately turn where there s a lot more supply and that will be helpful to us but so we ve been we ve seen that part of the market down pretty substantially over the last several years now if the higher end of the market continues to rotate and that s where you re starting to see some weakness perhaps we still think that the commercial do it for me is perhaps more driven by people willing to trade money for time than anything else and so we would expect that to be fairly robust and so yes housing has driven our business in the past we ve been very clear on that but when you look at the impacts sequentially from where we ve been it s still not where it would return to normal and so it s a little bit we don t know if there s significant downdrafts when you look at europe europe is interesting because the biggest impact we saw was ultimately the weather but assuming that the drought you saw the snow and everything else they got over there assuming that it s a more normal spring we re still pretty encouraged by what s going to happen because even though there s an economic downturn you still have to cut your grass and so ultimately i would tell you that we don t have significant growth in our model because it s just that wouldn t be prudent but we didn t put a significant downsize the model other than what we ve already talked to you about because i think that has a tendency to mute some of the economic impacts as well joe mondillo sidoti company llc analyst ok great thank you todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brett reese your line is now open unidentified speaker yes hi thanks for taking my question with so many balls up in the air and these turbulence you re navigating through how committed do you think the board is going to be in maintaining the dividend todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer we there has been no discussion of taking a dividend down we re very committed to holding the dividend we want to get back to growing the dividend but basically i we don t talk about taking the dividend down because still cash flow just fine the last couple of years have been interesting because we continue to invest in the business but i would tell you that we ve not had any discussion with regards to taking the dividend down unidentified speaker great thanks for answering the question operator we don t have any other questions at this time sir please continue todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer well thank you very much for joining today s conference call our next quarterly earnings call will be held in

africa insurance contractor based in the city of london uncovered the hidden impact of intermediary fees with the more risk an investor took on up to 78 of returns from private equity are consumed by intermediary fees gawlowski investigated and found that while this was the case the underlying equity and bond returns were over 4 rather than the 1 he actually received undisclosed fees added he calculated made intermediaries consume over three quarters of the underlying returns generated by the bond portfolio that was ultimately invested in gawlowski considered putting his pension into higher risk investments such as private equity funds and as the mutual fund returns resulted in real depreciation of his pension by 1 3 per year after fees he modelled a dummy private equity portfolio where he calculated that the portfolio would need to make 140 over a typical seven year period simply to cover the fees and to keep up with inflation this meant that an annualised internal rate of

do not typically compete on price with their retail active funds in the uk there is some evidence of a negative relationship between net returns and charges these fees which the fca regards as excessive have real societal costs as einstein is alleged to have said compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe a pension that appreciates by 13 3 per annum ie gross returns without the 78 intermediary fees will return 140 in seven years time whereas with the fees added an annual return of 2 7 will only appreciate by 20 these fees have already broken the defined benefit company pensions system and has the potential to cause real poverty in the western world where their effect is not well understood by the general population the fact that the uk financial services pr industry is worth 2 billion per year does not help furthermore if the fund management industry is taking three quarters of returns with 40 of funds disappearing upfront it becomes distinctly more risk averse as any loss of retail investor capital will invite scrutiny and therefore shed light on the level of their fees this risk aversion is manifested in the fact that 0 02 of assets under management

presentations as you know beginning with our fiscal first quarter we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard asc 606 on a modified retrospective basis the focus of our commentary this morning will be on our financial results under the old standard asc 605 which will allow for comparability on an apples to apples basis as well as comparisons to our original 2019 financial guidance after this discussion of our first quarter results we will review our updated guidance which now reflects the adoption of asc 606 with that introduction let me now turn the call over to john john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer thanks mary kay good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today q1 was another successful quarter for hill rom we started the year with continued momentum accelerating core revenue growth and driving solid operational execution resulting in financial performance that exceeded expectations on both the top line and the bottom line in addition to these strong results we continue to make great progress in our strategic priorities advancing our category leadership with differentiated innovative healthcare solutions expanding our category presence our geographic presence in emerging markets and transforming the portfolio to enhance outcomes and drive value for patients caregivers and our shareholders for the first quarter we reported core revenue growth of 6 reflecting continued progress and benefits from establishing a more durable and diversified business this represents our third consecutive quarter of mid single digit growth our focus on operational execution led to margin expansion of 110 basis points and we delivered adjusted earnings of 1 03 per diluted share an increase of 12 versus the prior year this represents our 14th consecutive quarter of double digit earnings growth importantly this strong performance provides flexibility to reinvest in our key growth initiatives and sets a solid foundation for achievement of both our short term and long term financial objectives our teams are doing an excellent job executing on our vision and our four strategic priorities aimed at enhancing our global category leadership to drive durable sustainable top line and bottom line growth their first priority is advancing our category leadership with differentiated solutions and innovation as i mentioned before new product revenue is a key metric in measuring the success of our strategy and meeting our objectives of driving core revenue growth 200 basis points to 300 basis points above our weighted average market growth rate the contribution of new products was a significant driver of top line growth in q1 once again with revenue of approximately 100 million on track with our expectation of driving 400 million in new product revenue for 2019 supporting this performance were several new innovative products including centrella connex vital signs spot monitor the monarch airway clearance system integrated table motion and our vision care portfolio in total eight new products represent 90 of new product revenue our connected innovations are focused on addressing challenges faced by our customers these challenges include escalating costs lower reimbursement and the need for innovation to enhance efficiency workflow and patient outcomes while preventing events like falls sepsis and pressure ulcers that may cause readmissions unreimbursed complications or reimbursement penalties we highlighted a number of recent achievements in our press release this morning including a global collaboration with microsoft to bring actionable point of care data and solutions to caregivers in real time as well as the commercial launches of the linq mobile smartphone application and earlysense continuous contact free heart rate and respiratory rate sensing technology we believe continued investments in innovation connectivity and data will allow us to enter new markets and channels creating even more opportunities to drive accelerated growth and value for patients and caregivers in the years ahead getting information to caregivers and proactively anticipating patient needs not only provides clinical and economic value it is central to achieving hill rom s mission turning to our second priority expanding internationally and penetrating emerging markets i m pleased to report we are beginning to see some progress we generated international core revenue growth of 3 this quarter reversing the trend from the second half of last year while still in the early stages of a turnaround we were encouraged by strong double digit growth collectively across asia pacific and latin america emerging markets today account for only 9 of hill rom s total revenue and we are in the process of reinvigorating our commercial operations we have recently added experienced senior leadership in asia pacific and are finalizing our assessment of product categories and go to market strategies to support meaningful growth and acceleration in the region our third strategic priority is transforming the portfolio through m a and portfolio optimization initiatives we thoughtfully considered our product offerings and have divested or exited a number of low growth and lower margin product areas that were not strategic to our growth strategy this has strengthened our portfolio enabled us to focus our energy and resources to drive more durable and consistent revenue growth in the core this diversification and our new product introductions has improved our overall revenue mix this quarter approximately 50 of our revenue is coming from categories that grow at 4 or greater demonstrating progress toward our 2020 goal of achieving 60 of total revenue from these higher growth categories in terms of m a this has been and continues to be an important part of our growth in diversification strategy with improved balance sheet flexibility we re in a strong position to enhance our category leadership and further our growth objectives we continue to deploy capital with a disciplined approach adhering to our rigorous strategic and financial criteria to generate attractive returns our final strategic priority is driving operational execution and strong financial performance we ve previously discussed our business optimization program focused on accelerating growth reducing complexity and improving our cost structure we have made significant progress and we are currently executing on a number of initiatives we expect to drive 50 million of pre tax savings over the next few years these benefits are not included in our long range plan but provide us the financial flexibility to reinvest in key priorities like new products and emerging markets in conclusion we are entering 2019 from a position of strength we are energized by our progress in executing on our four strategic priorities we remain focused on accelerating durable and profitable growth while enhancing margins profitability and generating strong cash flow we are capitalizing on new products advancing our pipeline and expanding in emerging markets we see a clear path to achieving our objectives to deliver innovative healthcare solutions and improve outcomes for patients and their caregivers by advancing connected care now i d like to introduce our new cfo barbara bodem barb is a seasoned finance executive with over 20 years of experience in healthcare barb joins us joins hill rom from mallinckrodt where she served as the senior vice president of finance earlier in her career she worked at hospira as the vice president global commercial finance as well as at eli lilly and company where she held a variety of finance roles in the us and the uk including cfo for lilly oncology with that i ll now turn it over to barb barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer thanks john and good morning everyone for the fiscal first quarter we reported gaap earnings of 0 62 per diluted share these results include after tax special items related to intangible amortization tax reform legislation business optimization and other special charges these results also reflect the adoption of asc 606 the new revenue recognition accounting standard on an adjusted basis excluding special items we reported earnings of 1 02 per diluted share on a comparable basis under the old accounting standard adjusted earnings increased 12 to 1 03 per diluted share exceeding our guidance range of 0 97 to 0 99 per diluted share these results reflect accelerated core revenue growth continued margin expansion and strategic investments to drive future growth as mary kay mentioned our commentary this morning will focus on our first quarter results on a comparable basis to the prior year period before the adoption of asc 606 please use the supplemental schedules posted to our website to follow along now let me briefly walk through the p l before turning to our financial outlook starting with revenue for the fiscal first quarter revenue of 684 million increased 2 on a reported basis and 3 on a constant currency basis core revenue accelerated to 6 exceeding our guidance of approximately 4 growth core revenue growth adjusts for the impact of foreign currency divestitures and non strategic assets we may exit including the surgical solutions international oem business domestic revenue on a core basis increased 7 in the first quarter driven by mid to high single digit growth across all three businesses international core revenue grew 3 in the quarter driven by improved performance in emerging markets and solid growth in patient support systems and front line care moving on to the business segments i will address revenue growth on a constant currency basis only starting with patient support system revenue of 342 million increased 3 and core revenue advanced 8 this represents the strongest growth we ve seen in this business in several years and it was well balanced geographically with strong growth both in the us and internationally for the third consecutive quarter we generated strong double digit growth across our key capital product categories in the us including med surg bed systems clinical workflow solutions and safe patient handling equipment outside of the us core patient support systems revenue increased 7 driven by solid growth in europe and double digit growth in the middle east latin america and asia pacific regions now moving on to front line care revenue increased 5 to 233 million new products including the connex spot monitor the monarch mobile vest and our vision care portfolio continue to be the key drivers domestic revenue increased 5 while international revenue grew 3 with solid performance across europe latin america and asia pacific lastly surgical solutions revenue of 109 million was flat to the prior year while core revenue increased 2 double digit growth in placements of the integrated table motion and solid growth in surgical consumables and patient positioning equipment were partially offset by a decline in the middle east impacted by the timing of capital orders versus last year now turning to the rest of the p l adjusted gross margin of 48 3 improved 60 basis points versus last year reflecting the positive contribution from mix as well as benefits from manufacturing productivity and procurement efforts collectively these factors more than offset the impact of tariffs and raw material inflation r d spending of 33 million increased 3 versus the prior year reflecting our ongoing commitment to innovation and investments in key programs to drive future growth adjusted sg a of 189 million was flat to the prior year as strategic investments were offset by disciplined cost management our adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 15 8 an improvement of 110 basis points compared to the prior year the adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 19 7 stock based compensation was a benefit of 0 03 per diluted share versus a benefit of 0 05 per diluted share last year excluding the impact of stock based compensation our first quarter tax rate was 21 7 so bottom line adjusted earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 1 03 per diluted share increased 12 excluding the impact of stock based compensation from both periods adjusted earnings per share increased 15 now turning to cash flow cash flow from operations was very strong in the first quarter advancing 25 to 116 million higher net income and strong working capital management contributed to this perform capital expenditures totaled 15 million 12 million lower than the prior year period primarily due to project timing as a result free cash flow of 101 million is 53 higher than last year in terms of the balance sheet and financial leverage our debt to ebitda ratio at the end of december was 3 2 ph and we ve returned approximately 92 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the fiscal first quarter now let me conclude this portion of the call by providing our guidance for fiscal 2019 as noted in the press release we are reaffirming our full year revenue growth margin expansion and adjusted earnings per diluted share growth guidance and are updating the adjusted earnings guidance range to solely reflect the adoption of asc 606 the updated 2019 financial guidance now compares to the 2018 modified financial results which are included in our supplemental schedules on the website the impact of asc 606 for fiscal year 2018 is a reduction in reported revenue of 14 million and a reduction in adjusted earnings of 0 10 per diluted share so for the full year we continue to expect reported revenue growth of 1 to 2 in constant currency growth of 2 to 3 core revenue growth is expected to increase 4 to 5 collectively non core revenue totaled approximately 110 million in 2018 and is expected to decline to approximately 50 million in 2019 this headwind is incorporated in our reported revenue guidance while core growth guidance is calculated by excluding the non core components in both the current and prior year period by business segment on a core basis we continue to expect all three businesses to grow in the 4 to 5 range in 2019 on a reported basis given the decline in non core revenue we expect patient support systems revenue to increase 1 to 2 and surgical solutions revenue to be flat to up 1 from a profitability standpoint we continue to expect the following adjusted gross margin to expand approximately 50 basis points reflecting mix and productivity improvements that more than offset incremental costs associated with tariffs and raw material inflation r d spending to increase in mid single digits representing approximately 5 of sales adjusted sg a of 26 to 26 5 of sales reflecting both savings related to our business optimization program and the reinvestment in key growth initiatives adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points other expense including interest of approximately 90 million and a tax rate of 21 to 22 and finally we expect a share count of approximately 67 5 million shares again we are only adjusting our earnings guidance range for the 0 10 impact related to the asc 606 aligned with the estimated impact we disclosed last november this adjustment lowers our previously disclosed adjusted earnings guidance of 5 08 to 5 16 per diluted share to 4 98 to 5 06 per diluted share importantly there is no change in our adjusted earnings growth profile we continue to expect growth of 7 to 9 and 12 to 14 growth excluding stock based compensation from a cash flow perspective we now project operating cash flow of approximately 420 million and capital expenditures of approximately 90 million this change reflects a reclassification related to asc 606 between operating cash flow and capital expenditures our 2019 free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at 330 million for the fiscal second quarter under asc 606 we expect revenue growth to be flat to the prior year and revenue to increase approximately 2 on a constant currency basis we expect core revenue to increase approximately 4 and are providing guidance for adjusted earnings of 1 09 to 1 11 per diluted share this represents growth of 7 to 9 and 9 to 11 growth excluding stock based compensation you may have noticed that the asc 606 impact was immaterial to our first quarter performance as we look forward the calendarization of the impact of 2019 will vary from the impact in 2018 this is primarily due to changes in quarterly revenue mix the timing of shipments and software implementations and the timing of the monarch launch which occurred mid year last year we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to be impacted by more than half of the expected 0 10 full year 2019 impact thank you and now i ll turn the call back over to john john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer thanks barb to summarize we are off to an excellent start this year and look forward to building on that momentum throughout 2019 by executing on our four strategic priorities we are confident that we can sustain the momentum we have delivered over the past three quarters we are committed to delivering durable mid single digit top line growth strengthening our margins and driving double digit earnings growth while delivering on our mission and creating enhanced value for our shareholders with that we will open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions i would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the hill rom website for seven days at www hill rom com our first question comes from the line of larry keusch from raymond james your line is open larry keusch raymond james analyst thank you good morning everyone maybe just two questions but the first one to start is john could you talk a little bit about obviously core growth in the first quarter was really very nicely strong at 6 but the outlook decelerates to 4 in the 2q so and i think the core comps are essentially the same for the 1q and the 2q so could you talk a little bit about thoughts around the deceleration john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah larry good question first we are very pleased with the first quarter results of 6 core growth and a nice progression of acceleration from last year starting the year at 2 in the first half and accelerating in the third and fourth quarter to 4 so good trajectory as we look at our guidance for q2 we are certainly considering all the puts and takes that are occurring in the business one of the things we see in q2 is that we ve got a tougher comp in europe and some other international markets it was a strong quarter last year and we re really just factoring that into the guidance as we look at q2 for the full year we re still very confident with the 4 to 5 guide but for q2 it looks more like a 4 and we re just calling it out to be representative of what we see across the business mary kay ladone senior vice president corporate development strategy and investor relations and larry it s mary kay with the 6 in q1 and 4 in q2 for the first half we re looking at 5 which is at the top end of our 4 to 5 core growth guidance for the year larry keusch raymond james analyst okay got it and then john obviously very encouraging comments around some of the progress being made overseas i know that there have been some geographies that have been challenged for a period of time i guess the question is in that 3 growth that you recorded how durable do you think that is and if you could weave into your answer what are the investments that need to be made into the emerging markets to drive that penetration higher now that you ve had a chance to kind of dig in and think a little bit more about the product portfolio and what needs to be done there john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah it s a great question larry and we re pleased with the start to the year 3 core growth in total international mid single digit in emerging markets at about 5 and double digit growth in the new regions of latin america and asia pac so really solid start to the year as i mentioned earlier q2 represents a tough comp for us in some of our bigger international regions so that s the primary reason for a deceleration in our overall core growth but as i look toward international for the full year we would expect to see acceleration at the end of the year in emerging market growth rates and that is driven by some of the early investments we re making in the organization and aligning ourselves around the key product categories for those regions we re in the final stages now of putting together an investment plan in asia pacific for the emerging markets in asia pacific with obviously china being the biggest opportunity for us we expect to turn on those investments as mentioned before in the second half of the year so the next this current quarter that we re in is all about finalizing those plans and preparing ourselves to turn on those investments we would expect to see those investments really begin to mature about a year later right at the end of our lrp period at the end of fiscal 20 so we re excited about the opportunities they look promising and similar comments in other emerging markets in latin america and as we previously discussed we have shown an ability to drive emerging market growth in regions like the middle east and africa where we ve had over a three year period 18 compounded annual growth rate so our confidence in being able to deliver more consistent durable revenue growth in the emerging markets continues to grow and we re pleased with the early success that we saw in q1 larry keusch raymond james analyst okay terrific thank you operator and bob hopkins of bank of america is on the line with a question please state your question your line is open robert hopkins bank of america analyst well thank you and good morning john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer good morning bob robert hopkins bank of america analyst yeah good morning it really there s a lot of moving pieces here with some of the accounting changes and such but i just wanted to ask a question on the earnings guidance for the year so just i m curious what are you assuming in the new guidance on eps for the impact of stock based comp on earnings and the reason i ask that is that it was my impression from the conversations kind of in the last call that the stock based compensation may actually be an offset to the new accounting change so i guess my question to be very clear is what are you assuming in terms of the impact on eps from stock based comp in this new fiscal 19 guidance barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer i ll take this one hi bob it s barb how are you today thank you for the question with regards to stock based comp if you recall last year we recognized a pretty large benefit from stock based comp about 0 24 or yes 0 24 on the full year when we think about our guidance we don t typically include this in our earnings guidance and last year s 0 24 was really driven by much of the executive changes that were going on something that we don t anticipate seeing a like for like and as you look forward we don t typically try to project what stock based comp benefits are going to be because they re driven by a couple of different factors it s driven by individual choices about when they re going to exercise options it s also driven by market performance as you go along so we have not included stock based comp in our lrp guidance we have not included it in our 2019 either what we gave last november nor what we ve provided today under 606 this just not something that we ve incorporated because we think it s pretty hard to forecast and i m pretty hard to transmit out what we have done is we ve been very transparent about it so quarter by quarter to the extent that we see a benefit if you recall i said earlier that we saw a 0 03 benefit this quarter we ll be transparent about that to the extent that that allows us some reinvestment opportunities in the business we may consider that but we will not include it in the guidance as we go forward as we think about the impact of asc 606 the 0 10 impact that we have shown in the revised adjusted earnings guidance on eps is purely the asc 606 impact so it s looking at what we experienced or what we ve seen in the restatement of 2018 and carried that forward into 2019 and then again i want to reemphasize that as you think about the calendarization of that 0 10 we re anticipating the majority of that to be coming through in q2 john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah and just for the full year then our ex stock based comp for the full year still 12 to 14 growth rate growth rates are not impacted by the asc 606 changes and then in q1 ex stock based comp we had a 15 eps growth rate so i hope that answers your question bob robert hopkins bank of america analyst yeah you know that s very clear i appreciate that so my interpretation of all those comments is that it makes sense not to include it it s hard to predict but all else equal that could be an offset you may choose to invest it depending on how things play out but it s still a potential source of offset at least as i read it john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yes i think that s a good way to read it robert hopkins bank of america analyst okay perfect and then the other comment i wanted to ask was just on surgical solutions in particular because that was the one that was maybe a little weaker than we thought and you called out middle east maybe you could just talk a little bit john about how big is that middle east portion in surgical solutions what was kind of the growth rate this quarter and how long do you think it ll take to turn that around because that s obviously been a source of volatility in the past as well john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah i guess i would start out bob by saying when we put our plan together this is how we expected that surgical business to kind of phase through the year that we knew it s going to be a lighter q1 still confident about our 4 to 5 full year performance there we did have double digit integrated table motion take place internationally but it was offset by some orders that we expected that have come out of in q2 or q3 so it s to us it s what we expected it s not a surprise we re on track and we do have the confidence in the full year guidance of 4 to 5 robert hopkins bank of america analyst perfect ph thank you very much operator and david lewis is on the line of morgan stanley with the question please state your question your line is open david lewis morgan stanley analyst great good morning just a quick follow up for barb and then maybe two for john really quickly barb just taking asc 606 aside in the stock based comp aside i think you re pretty clear there if i just sort of think about the beginning of the year margin is sort of in line with expectations you re kind starting the year kind of above expectations mary kay s commentary in the first half kind of suggest your operating performance is at the top end of your guidance so with margins coming in where they expected and revenue kind of toward the top end of the range why does that necessitate an earnings revision at this time and just update us again on tariffs 0 10 to 0 15 is that still the right number and then a couple for john barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer yeah sure so why don t i start then and we ll talk a little bit about i ll kind of go in reverse order and we ll come back to where we are on our guidance for the year so starting with our margin expansion i d like to take you all the way back to what we said in the long range plan which is that over the long range plan we expected to see an operating margin improvement of about 300 basis points and we delivered 100 basis points last year and our guidance this year is to provide another 100 basis points as you will see that kind of ebbs and flows from quarter to quarter depending on the specific performance in that given quarter of that 100 basis points we would expect about half of that to come from gross margin and the other half of it to come from opex leverage in the rest of the p l and what we saw in q1 was very consistent with that so in q1 we showed the 110 basis points of which 60 was coming through gross margin and the balance of it coming through the rest of the p l of the 60 basis points when we looked at the 60 basis points and when we looked at the guidance for the full year on gross margin we took into consideration tariffs i think we estimated last fall that we thought the headwind from tariffs was going to be about 10 million to 15 million in addition to that as you probably aware we re all experiencing a little bit of inflation on our direct materials as well but what we said is that mix and productivity in gross margin would more than offset that and we would be able to deliver the 50 basis points worth of improvement even after absorbing those as we look at q1 and we look at our experience with the tariffs in q1 it s very consistent with that 10 million to 15 million for the full year and as you know we still have some uncertainty about where tariffs are going to land for the full year as well so as we re thinking about gross margin as we re thinking about our operating margin expansion we re feeling pretty confident and pretty comfortable with where our q1 is and how it fits with our overall guidance so to your question about you know if we re seeing growth at the higher end of it and we re seeing a nice margin expansion in q1 why is it that we re not adjusting our earnings for the full year and i think the answer to that at this point is that it s still very early while we are very excited about and pleased about our performance in q1 it is only the first quarter of a four quarter year and so we have a lot of around to cover and at this point in time we thought it would be to certain to signal any upside to the earnings i hope that answers your question david lewis morgan stanley analyst yes very very clear barb and then just john two kind of one tactical one strategic for me on centrella could you just kind of talk about the contribution centrella to the pipeline this particular quarter how has that changed over the last couple of quarters and from here it is the growth contribution from centrella improved from here and then strategically just the 50 million you talked about a few weeks ago in and above the lrp can you give some sense of sort of as you re thinking right now where those investments go whether it s just the front line care business the communications portfolio or the emerging markets piece where is it likely we see that money go thanks so much john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah thanks david so let me kind of broaden it out a little bit beyond centrella at first and then i ll get into specifics on centrella to the extent i can so for new products first of all as i first said in my prepared comments about 100 million of contribution in q1 from new products what i didn t say is that s an 80 growth rate over the prior year so we really like the momentum we re seeing with new product growth it is contributing significantly to top line overall core growth probably to the tune of something above 300 basis points in first quarter as we look at that total new products category which again consists of eight products that are really driving that overall performance it continues to look promising to us this ability to continue to be that fuel that drives above weighted average market growth rate comfortably of that 200 basis points to 300 basis points so that s the overall characterization of that new product bucket that was specifically with respect to centrella and probably the best way to address that is our med surg category because there is some cannibalization of centrella over other med surg product offerings we saw double digit growth rate in q1 i guess more specifically in the neighborhood of 30 growth so very strong growth we re really excited about the new technology we re bringing into that ecosystem with our new launch of earlysense and watchcare in the case of earlysense we think that s a breakthrough technology non contact twice per second measurement of heart rate and respiratory rate and getting a really a running trend of heart rate respiratory rate to provide actionable insights and early intervention where required to reduce costly complications and life threatening complications so centrella is that digital hub in that ecosystem we re pleased with this progress i m very pleased with engagements since the last time we had a call i visited customers in china visited customers in the united states in europe and in canada and all of them are very excited about the offerings that this product provides them but not just on its own but at the whole ecosystem of sensing technology immediate care communication technology and being able to provide a turnkey solution that we can scale and integrate into their system i think one of the highlights of the last three months is visiting north america s first digital hospital and seeing how they ve incorporated these types of products in that setting with connected vital signs and connected beds and really a command center that really allows them to show significant workflow improvements of 30 plus as well as falls reductions in that same neighborhood so very excited about the response we re seeing from customers around the world on the value that these connected products bring not just as a stand alone but as a complete ecosystem getting to your second question david about the 50 million we have a lot of investment proposals that are coming forward in the organization now neighboring around 30 ph or so we are vetting those as we speak and racking and stacking what those best opportunities look like it ll be a mix between new products and innovation and emerging markets and perhaps a couple of select other investments in commercial operations or clinical studies and clinical data generation so it s a little bit too early to say what exactly those are but certainly with 50 million over the coming years that we ll have to invest we ll be looking to pace new investments as the savings are realized and put you know our best investments forward first as we think about how to deploy that cash but thank you for the question david david lewis morgan stanley analyst thanks john operator and we have matt taylor on the line with ubs please state your question your line is open matt taylor ubs analyst hi good morning thank you for taking the question john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer good morning matt matt taylor ubs analyst so i wanted to good morning i want to ask you about your kind of guidance philosophy just seeing newer with this team understand not raising at this early stage in this year that s certainly prudent i guess could you give us a little bit more color on when you might feel comfortable raising i feel like it s a little bit of an unfair question but if you had a 6 growth rate in the second quarter does that give you enough confidence or maybe you could just talk about with 6 growth this quarter are you getting more confidence that you can actually grow above 4 to 5 or were there just kind of onetime things that helped this quarter john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah great question matt let me reiterate we re very happy about the momentum from 2 a year ago to now up to 6 so clearly organic momentum is driving the portfolio and driving our core growth as we think about providing guidance we re looking at all the puts and takes across the business and i think our philosophy would be summarized pretty simply in three words meet or beat right we re looking at the guidance as a meet or beat number we certainly don t want to disappoint anybody including ourselves so when we look across the portfolio and all the businesses in the regions of all the dynamics that go on in the business as diverse as this i can boil it down to those three simple words that s our view meet or beat barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer and matt this is barb with regards to the timing of when we might revisit q2 is the obvious time so as we get through the second quarter we ll revisit our position and if we have an update we will obviously be sending that out so thanks for the question matt matt taylor ubs analyst thank you i just had one follow up i was wondering if you could expand on some of the cost savings initiatives that you ve laid out here it seems like they re kind of coming into focus can you talk about any that you have prioritized that will be helping margins sooner or anything that s changed sequentially to give us some flavor for the initiative that you ll be executing on here in the back half of the year john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah sure matt i ll start with that question and hand it over to barb for additional comments we re kicking those off right now it s going on a multiple fronts so they re a couple of very i ll point it three big ones one is continue the consolidation of our manufacturing footprint more recently we ve begun to consolidate some of our r d centers so we can concentrate our r d in centers of excellence around the businesses and around specific areas such as digital and software development so that is under way as we speak and the third one is really the whole category of just spending more wisely on everything from meetings to consulting to outside services and travel et cetera things we call indirect spend that s the third kind of big bucket that we re pursuing as we progress and because of the decentralized nature of the company we re able to execute on multiple fronts with respect to of manufacturing footprint or reorganizations like the ones i mentioned so those are the first three that i would point out and as you look over the three year period it s relatively evenly spread between the three year period in terms of when we see the savings a lot of it gets kicked off this fiscal year or we begin to realize it at the second half of this year and then annualize it more into next year as it rolls out any additional comments barb you would add barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer the only other thing i would add is that what you don t see and so you see relatively say well we ve got 3 growth in our r d spend we ve got flat sg a in particular in the flat sg a what s not visible is the fact that we are actively repurposing investments within that flat sg a so we ve taken some actions that have really brought down our g a area spend so that we can turn around and reinvest that in selling and marketing activities or commercial activities and other areas so some of the changes we re making are really not going to be visible in the p ls the expense lines as you see it because it s all happening in the redirection and the realignment of the spend that we have i hope that s helped in giving a little extra color matt taylor ubs analyst it does thank you so much for all that operator and we have rick wise of stifel on the line with a question please state your question your line is open frederick wise stifel nicolaus company analyst good morning john maybe just help us think about the current new product pipeline obviously r d spending has gone up sort of in the neighborhood of 5 clearly new products are making a difference sort of two questions about it one today what percentage of the pipeline of the new product revenue you re generating is capital and do you related like centrella but what s next and how is that pipeline changing likely to change and evolve over the next few years john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah good question rick i mean if i look at our new product revenue to specifically answer your question about how much of it is capital it s probably in the neighborhood of about 15 maybe 20 the most but it looks like around 15 of the eyeballs the numbers in front of me here that s actually consistent with our frames business our bed frames is 20 of our total revenue today so it s proportionately similar to our current mix or a little bit less capital dependent if i think about the future of what we re looking forward to we ve talked about four key product launches this year with linq mobile as part of our cws or clinical communications portfolio watchcare which is our incontinence detection device with a consumable recurring revenue stream business earlysense which is our heart rate respiratory rate monitoring in the bed and then retinavue next generation the first three are already launched or in the early phases of launch we re getting great feedback on all of those they haven t really had the dollared impact in terms of new products yet because they re really in the early phases but each of those three linq watchcare and earlysense we expect those to grow substantially over the coming quarters and couple of years here the one is not yet launched is our retinavue next generation product which is really a point and click easy to use our retinal scanning device and that s expected to come in the second half of this fiscal year so we feel good about what s in that portfolio of the eight products that drive 90 of the new products basket and then four new products coming into it this year as well as a pipeline of additional innovation that we have not yet disclosed looking very promising at driving category leadership in these seven strategic focus categories that we ve outlined most recently in the j p morgan presentation those seven focus areas and categories represent about 26 billion of total available market to us so we ve got a lot of room to grow in in these seven strategic categories that we ve outlined many of which have nice growth rates above the overall weighted average market growth rate for the company frederick wise stifel nicolaus company analyst that s very helpful second question just sort of a multipart and it s really for both you and barbara just maybe you could just talk through i d like to hear both your perspectives on barbara you re a new cfo walking in the door both of you are building on the great work and foundation that john greisch and steve did barbara what are your key priorities you talked about sg a sort of repurposing and efficiencies what do you think are the key opportunities over and above what we may know about the company priorities john i d be hear happy to hear your perspective and maybe the second part of the question is given the significant reduction in leverage and balance sheet improvement and cash flow growth john you ve been in place for a while now how are you thinking about m a i heard you promoted a rockstar biz dev strategy kind of person how are you tasking that excellent individual what can we expect on the m a front and portfolio front thank you john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah thanks for the question rick and i don t know if i m a rockstar or not but well time will tell and you can review us and judge but i don t aspire to be a rock star so when it comes to m a and it kind of feeds into my priority at this point i do feel very good about the operational execution of the organization i feel very good about the leadership team both my immediate leadership team as well as a broader leadership team and i feel very good about our ability to continue to deliver mid single digit top line growth organically so a lot of time and attention is now being directed toward m a we are looking for accretive acquisitions accretive to growth accretive to our growth profile improving the profile of the company that drives higher growth rates higher profitability and gives us the kind of returns on the investments around m a that we are looking for and we ll be rigorous and disciplined around so that s where i m spending my time obviously can t comment on things that are speculative at this point but i would say in general i do like the pipeline that we re developing of opportunities we re engaging on multiple fronts around m a they re are going to be supportive and you re going to if we get something done you ll i think see a very clear strategic fit of how these acquisitions would fit into these product categories that we ve identified as strategic to us and i think you ll see that they re going to be accretive to the overall growth of the company so that s where i m spending my time rick in addition to everything else that you would expect me to spend time on barb barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer so rick great question and i appreciate you asking it it has been not quite two months for me but it s been a very good two months and i ve been very impressed with the organization and how focused the organization is on the strategic priorities that john outlined for everybody earlier today it s embedded in the cadence of how we operate everyday when i think about where am i going to be spending my time clearly from an m a perspective externally doing everything with my team to make sure we re supporting the m a process and that we re doing the right deals that are going to drive the future growth of the company growth is also where i ll be focusing from an internal standpoint it s really about making sure our resources are lined up to the best opportunities that we have over the past few weeks have had the opportunity to really get a view of our internal innovation pipeline and it s very impressive and so making sure that we are funding that appropriately moving things forward is key making sure that as we look at our internal resource allocation that we are as streamlined and efficient in those areas that are not business facing or not driving growth so that we can free up resources for those areas where they will drive growth is going to be a key agenda and area for us it s not new from what steve was doing but it ll be a particular area of focus for me i hope that helps give you some insight into where my head is frederick wise stifel nicolaus company analyst thank you so much barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer lisa we have time for just one more question this morning operator our final question will come from kristen stewart of barclays please state your question your line is open kristen stewart barclays analyst hey everybody thanks for taking the question bard welcome to the first call ph just to go back i guess more of a couple of clarifying questions so when you are talking about flat year over year growth for the second quarter is that going to be also on a asc 606 revised basis is that fair or is that flat versus asc 605 barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer kristen it s barb thanks for the welcome excited to be here all of our guidance going forward is under 606 so the only time we were going to do anything under 605 is helping you understand q1 2019 performance go forward is only 606 so when we talked about guidance for q2 we said it would be flat on a reported basis 2 on a constant currency and then looking at 4 from a core growth for the quarter all under 606 and remember that i also flagged that we do think we ll see a disproportionate impact from an eps perspective of the 606 change in q2 mary kay ladone senior vice president corporate development strategy and investor relations and kristen this is mary kay just to clarify you do need to update your models for the 2018 modified results that s the base for 2q under 606 kristen stewart barclays analyst okay that s what i thought so it s flat off of that call it 706 million revenue the kind of restated asc 606 number mary kay ladone senior vice president corporate development strategy and investor relations yes that is correct kristen stewart barclays analyst okay and then the eps was lowered by 0 03 under asc 606 a year ago but you re basically saying the benefit is going to be greater and that s one of the things driving the little bit lower eps relative to expectations it also looks like margins are going to be little bit lower than at least the full year run rate is there any kind of thing causing that or they re just timing of investments or effects of anything you can speak to into why margins might be a little bit lower in 2q as well or maybe that s all it barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer i think when we re looking at q2 and we re looking at margins for the quarter margins are going to be driven by multifactorial sort of thing the mix of the products that we re projecting for the second quarter and that mix does fluctuate a little bit from quarter to quarter as well as timing of initiatives as well as headwinds so there s a lot of different moving pieces in there i don t know that you can draw any straight conclusions between 606 and the margin for the second quarter kristen stewart barclays analyst okay and then just to kind of go back i guess to beginning conversation not to beat a dead horse but the stock based comp was 0 03 in the quarter you re kind of keeping the guidance if i m hearing kind of how you responded back to everyone else s comments should we just think about you guys just really targeting kind of that range for the full year and to the extent there s additional stock based comp more of a willingness to kind of reinvest those opportunities and along the same lines with the 50 million in savings that you ve talked about should we just think about that as something that just automatically will get reinvested and not necessarily be additive to the lrp barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer kristen thanks thanks for the question and thanks for the opportunity to clarify back on the sbc side first of all from an lrp perspective and from a fiscal year perspective again we don t forecast the sbc which you know also on the business optimization that is not it is incremental to what we have in the lrp with the goal of reinvesting all of that so when we think about the guidance these two things are not things that we would have factored into achieving the eps guidance that we ve laid out either in the long range plan or for 2019 when you think about how are we looking at sbc for the remainder of the year again i believe that it s a good position to not try to forecast that out and put it in the guidance to the extent that we are seeing benefits and we re seeing those benefits early enough in the year where we can do something with those benefits we will look for reinvestment opportunities to the extent that the timing of when we see the sbc benefits come through and when we have investment opportunities within the quarter and within the fiscal year don t align then that will end up being potentially incremental to our guidance for the full year did that help kristen stewart barclays analyst yes it does thanks so much john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer thanks kristen operator i ll now turn the call back over to john groetelaars for closing remarks john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer well thanks and thanks for all the great questions and engagement this morning i guess summary comments was would be look things have never been better we ve gone from a 2 growth in core growth in first half of 18 4 q3 4 q4 last year coming into this year with 6 the organic growth engine is alive and working well we feel very confident about our ability to deliver mid single digit top line growth that s consistent durable in addition to that i think we ve shown over 14 quarters our ability to deliver double digit adjusted eps so we re confident in our guidance for q2 and are confident in our guidance for the full year and i want to thank you for all your time and attention this morning operator ladies and gentlemen

earnings conference call today this morning i m joined by our chief operating officer joe lebel and chief financial officer mike fitzpatrick as always we appreciate your interest in our performance and are pleased to be able to discuss our operating results with you as has been our practice we will highlight a few key items and add some color to the results posted for the quarter and then we look forward to taking your questions in terms of financial results for the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were 0 55 quarterly reported earnings were impacted by merger related expenses branch consolidation charges and a non core favorable income tax item these items net of tax benefit provides 696 000 of non core net income representing about 0 01 a share excluding those amounts core earnings per share were 0 54 a respectable 20 increase over the fourth quarter of 2017 regarding capital management for the quarter the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 17 the company s 88th consecutive quarterly cash dividend the 0 17 dividend represents a 31 payout of core earnings which will allow us to build capital levels as we pursue a variety of opportunities to deploy that capital in growth initiatives the volatility in equity markets provide the opportunity to repurchase shares during the quarter the company repurchased 459 251 shares at a weighted average price of 23 60 per share there were 1 3 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase program at current prices you could expect the company to be an active repurchaser of shares in the coming months advertisement advertisement performance metrics for the quarter reflect the progress made over the past year from a profitability perspective the company achieved record core earnings of 94 1 million or 1 98 per share the best in our history our fourth quarter run rate evidenced a core return on assets of 1 38 and a core return on tangible common equity of 15 19 which reflects the work we have done to improve relative profitability we achieved these results by managing our margins which expanded over the year and by aggressively reducing operating expenses as we integrated the sun bank operation and consolidated 17 retail branches over the course of the year from a balance sheet perspective we strengthen the company s risk profile by several key measures the company maintained a prudent interest rate risk position as evidenced by our 3 68 net interest rate margin for the fourth quarter preserved a strong liquidity position with a loan to deposit ratio of 96 build tangible book value per share which increased 5 increased the tangible common equity ratio by 113 basis points to 9 55 and reduced total non performing assets to just 18 8 million or 25 basis points of total assets less than half the level of year end 2017 collectively these efforts have been engineered to prepare our balance sheet to weather a wide variety of risks that may develop in the quarters and years ahead while developing our core business we ve continued to take advantage of opportunities as they arise including the recent agreement to acquire capital bank the capital acquisition is proceeding smoothly with regulatory approval secured on december 19 just 27 business days following our application earlier this week capital shareholders approved the transaction which is now expected to close on january 31st of 2019 the capital integration and accompanying branch consolidation is scheduled to be completed late in the second quarter of this year capital improves our deposit market share in cumberland and atlantic counties to 33 and 24 respectively it will positively impact earnings in the second half of the year capital s maintained an asset sensitive commercial bank balance sheet with a conservative loan to deposit ratio of 67 modest 51 basis point cost of deposits and a stand alone roa of over 1 25 not only does the franchise nicely complement existing oceanfirst business but their financial performance will improve our performance metrics especially after the integration is completed bear in mind however that the additional shares to be issued in connection with the capital bank transaction closing may provide a core eps headwind of about 0 01 to 0 02 per quarter until the full integration in june of this year advertisement advertisement also the board of directors announced their decision to appoint grace vallacchi executive vice president and chief risk officer of the company and the bank to the boards of directors of both the company in the bank effective immediately grace will retain her executive vice president and chief risk officer positions as well as her role in the executive management team and report directly to me grace joined oceanfirst in september of 2017 and was previously an associate deputy comptroller in the northeastern district of the office of the comptroller of the currency with her experience and insight grace has made a positive impact on our company and i know her contributions as a director will be a valuable addition to our board as we look toward performance throughout 2019 we are squarely focused on two important initiatives the first will be efforts to further improve efficiencies through the deployment of technology and the consolidation of at least four additional legacy oceanfirst branches the second will be an effort to improve the consistency of our loan growth as major integrations are behind us the recruitment of seasoned commercial bankers will become a primary objective as we expand our commercial lending presence into both the new york and philadelphia metropolitan areas joe lebel will walk you through some additional detail regarding our performance for the quarter and his plans to build out the business throughout 2019 at this point i ll turn the call over to joe after joe s discussion we ll be happy to take your questions joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer advertisement advertisement thanks chris commercial loan originations were strong in the quarter as expected with closings in excess of 151 million overall loan production of 260 million represented a very solid quarter more importantly yields on the new originations exceeded 5 with improvements in all lending areas overall loan growth was muted but positive at 36 6 million as new loan originations and the purchase of a 49 5 million pool of student loans similar to earlier purchases this year offset several payoffs from credits not meeting our credit disciplines or pricing guidelines since the sun acquisition is nearing its one year anniversary we have touched many of the credits in some fashion and fully expect attrition from our review to abate similar to other acquisitions we ve made i d like to update you on the talent acquisition strategies as the successful integration of sun is behind us we focused our efforts on the continued expansion of our commercial banking business by identifying senior leadership in geographic markets and building lending teams around them we ve added several new lenders in philadelphia in the past few months and expect to expand our presence in new york city in the first quarter as well we ve also created a syndication desk to focus on the purchase of loans that meet our conservative credit appetite while we have not changed our credit disciplines we believe our increased scale can lead to thoughtful conservative balance sheet growth in existing and adjacent markets without undue risk while these transactions maybe a thinner overall margins the value and consistent loan growth with reasonable expense levels provides a modest complement to our core lending business and will have a positive effect on overall profitability turning to the interest margin our nim of 3 68 represents a 4 basis point increase quarter to quarter largely attributable to better execution on originations purchase accounting in the margin declined 1 basis point from 24 basis points to 23 basis points during the quarter the resulting core nim increased to 3 45 up 5 basis points yield on earning assets improved by 9 basis points to 4 31 our expectation on the nim remains at or close to current levels with any impact from deposit repricing and reduction from purchase accounting offset by continued modest gains in the loan portfolio looking at the positive trends we saw a decrease of approximately 40 million due to seasonal government attrition and tempered seasonal business activity further attrition from acquired banks cd and money market accounts is slowing as expected and we expect first quarter government balances to increase due to their quarterly tax collections deposit retention for the acquired banks has exceeded our expectations despite the fierce competition for deposits in our markets in that vein our cost of deposits rose to 48 basis points from 39 basis points as we proactively reprice selected corporate cash management client accounts while costs will increase from these proactive actions in q1 we don t expect significant repricing to occur the quarterly deposit beta was 36 and the year ended at 16 as our funding profile continues as one of the best in our state advertisement advertisement a brief comment on expenses for the quarter while we held the line on operating expenses we did not achieve our internal targets and remain committed to continued progress our goal of achieving an efficiency ratio nearing 50 by fiscal year end 2019 remains in place as chris noted continued branch rationalization and consolidation will occur outside the capital bank acquisition these actions to proactively manage operating expenses in combination with the loan growth initiatives i outlined earlier are targeted to both further improve our efficiency ratio and contribute to eps growth throughout the year with that we ll move on to the q a part of the call questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instruction first question comes from frank schiraldi with sandler o neill please go ahead with your question advertisement advertisement frank schiraldi sandler o neill partners lp analyst good morning christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer good morning frank frank schiraldi sandler o neill partners lp analyst just on as you guys talk about philly and new york as you talk about new york is that sort of the can you give little more color there is that sort of the outer boroughs what sort of lending are you looking at and is this is the idea to open an lpo with something that might eventually lead to branches just some further color there thanks christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement sure we have limited coverage in new york already we have one commercial lender located in manhattan they came to us through sun so it s not a new market for us per se it s also a market that i have a significant background in as does joe lebel so we ve been watching and waiting for the right opportunity to start adding resources up there so i d characterize this we ve identified a couple of hires that we intend to make hopefully that d be concluded by the end of the first quarter and these are seasoned folks that are well known to us that we think can be pretty productive in terms of what we re looking at there it would be throughout the boroughs and as well as manhattan and it would be a mix of c i and cre but to be realistic the c i making progress in c i takes a longer period of time so i would expect that we re going to see relationship real estate lending meaning some owner occupied properties some investor properties we ve been waiting for the right opportunity to use some of our capacity in the balance sheet add some of those properties we ve looked at loan pools over the past probably couple of years and decided that we d rather go in and do it through a direct origination platform so it ll be a commercial loan origination office it will be several people there ll be known producers and we look forward to giving you more color on that so that s in progress i think we ll have that in the first half of the year established and then grow it from that point similar situation in philadelphia although we re little bit earlier in the process in philadelphia so we ve been covering that market more thoroughly probably starting the second half of 2018 and have made a number of recent hires and we have a number of folks in the pipeline for that so in both places we re hiring the teams first and then we ll establish a physical location but i think in both areas we see an opportunity now as joe mentioned the loans that are going into the book today are yielding over 5 so we think the pricing is back where it should be and we think by entering those markets we can get selective relationship transactions that will be added to the balance sheet so i m going to ask joe to just make a comment or two about the hires he has made to date and what he has been selected advertisement advertisement joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer frank it s continued path down the road of seasoned lenders from national regional banks that have been through cycles that have big followings in books of business and we ve continued that we had the loan production offices in newtown square and now we ve hired two more folks that will be in central philadelphia and hopefully on our way for a third and continue to recruit in this space frank schiraldi sandler o neill partners lp analyst and as you think about growth into philly and new york just curious how are you thinking about net loan growth net organic growth in general and what are you thinking about in terms of net growth in new jersey at this point christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer sure so if you think about how we ve guided in the past saying that we d like to have say somewhere in the range of 50 million to 100 million of loan growth number one we d like to be much more consistent about that we recognized over the last couple of quarters albeit due to pay offs and somethings like that we ve had less consistency in the net growth numbers so we want to be more consistent so i think we need to supplement what we re doing in new jersey and then the second thing is i would look at this as being largely a second half of the year event you ll see maybe some impacts in the first or second quarter but it s really going to be a second half event i think that we could be then at that point have the productive capacity to be looking more toward the higher end of that range so maybe we can begin to target more of the 100 million plus per quarter in loan growth so this is not something that will change overnight but we were waiting we did not want to enter either of these markets in a small way or kind of as a hobby we wanted to make sure we re getting high quality staff that staff comes with it s expensive staff appropriately so but we think it s the right time the last thing i d say about that is to be credible to the folks that you re hiring in those markets you want to make sure you ve got everything aligned internally so having finished we wanted to get through the sun transition we had to be able to demonstrate that we ve got all engines firing with a great support team that we would be able to support from a credit infrastructure perspective adding those kinds of producers frank schiraldi sandler o neill partners lp analyst okay and then just finally if i could i mean obviously you talked joe you talked about the expenses and the expense base is a bit higher i think than people were looking for it sounds to me like these weren t sort of you called out a few categories in the release but is it fair to say these weren t sort of one off this is sort of the operating expense base and then to get to your goals you re looking for further branch rationalization to get there does that is that fair michael j fitzpatrick executive vice president chief financial officer yeah they re mostly frank it s mike it s primarily recurring expenses although the i can see equipment for example is higher than we expected we re holding a dozen properties for sale so those correspond while we wrote those properties down to market value the operating cost associated with taxes and maintenance are recurring expense so we have an opportunity to exit those 12 branches and reduce expenses that way that s taken a little bit longer than we had thought and some of the professional fees are up a little bit that tended to be a little bit lumpy we did have higher legal and consulting and accounting professionals in the fourth quarter especially with all the tax issues that s going on in new jersey with the new jersey and the federal taxation so just a little bit of lumpiness in that line that might not recur but yes we would and going forward you will see when we start with the new year now we do have compensation increases for our staff that take effect at the beginning of the year so we ll grow into that over the course of the year so looking forward we ll see the expenses rise little bit above these levels frank schiraldi sandler o neill partners lp analyst all right thank you christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer thanks frank operator and the next question comes from david bishop with fig partners please go ahead with your question david bishop fig partners llc analyst hey good morning guys christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer good morning david joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer good morning david bishop fig partners llc analyst chris you spoke about some of the headwinds in terms of the originations but may have been impacted by continued pay off of some loans you re looking to exit just curious i don t know if you have the number in front of you but do you have a sense what the exit of those credits how much of a headwind that was in aggregate for the year and what gives you confidence or do you have confidence that the majority of that is behind you as you enter into 2019 christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer i d give you an order of magnitude and then joe may have some comments on the types of things that we allowed to kind of move on there was about just in december we had about 47 million worth of pay offs but much of that was the kind of stuff you would expect to pay off joe can walk you through a couple of examples i think what we re recognizing is that on the size of this balance sheet now we need to have a little more productive capacity and we wanted to be careful not to try and draw that out of the core markets that we feel we ve already got covered pretty well so i ll just say we win every deal in our market but i think we are winning a lot of the deals who want to be in our market so stretching the markets a little bit provides us a vast pool both in philly and new york so to just put on a little bit of production in each one of those and make sure that these pay offs which are probably a way of life for the next year two that we can overcome them and still continue still find a way to do very consistent loan growth so joe maybe a little color on the loans that we kind of let go we could have in some cases stayed in joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer i think it s a couple of things dave one is we ve gone through this before we tend to take a fairly strict approach to the acquired banks loans and make decisions on credit and structure and pricing so we do have some of that runoff i think we mentioned this in the third quarter it was like 75 million and i don t know what the actual number related just the sun would have been in the fourth quarter but as chris mentioned about 47 million in payoffs just in december but three of those loans were the type of loans that should pay off when they due 9 million construction loan that s converting to an insurance company led permanent and 11 million land loan that was on the books for two years as agreed and paid off from construction refinance so those types of things are expected along with on occasion the acquired bank portfolios but typically we ve seen the acquired bank portfolios runoff be exacerbated in year one as we touch these credits and make decisions and then slowdown in years two and three as the folks that remain are acclimated to us where you re comfortable with them so i expect some of that runoff to abate in 2019 david bishop fig partners llc analyst just curious as sort of like inaudible crystal ball you had look back in terms of the sun acquisition in terms of the way these loans have trended and paid down any surprises from that perspective or does this change how you maybe approach how you re handling the capital bank portfolio versus the future acquisitions and scrubbing their loan portfolio christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer it s a good question so a few factors here the first is that the sun loans had on average had a larger average balance so what we might have i think maybe modeled better is that in larger dollar loans as they come up for renewal the competition is more heated and in many cases it was a competitive decision where there were elements like structural elements like more cash out where we had a relationship because stayed in the loan but the guy can get a lot more dollars than we d be willing to do somewhere else and that s going to happen if you got a 15 million 20 million 30 million loan so i think we ve been thoughtful about that overall we re very pleased with where sun is tracking we ve got some other positives in things like the cost of deposits and the operating expenses kind of played out well as we then translate that into capital to answer the second part of your question our capital is a much more granular portfolio so a lot smaller average loan balance and i think that we re going to have less of an issue related to the prepaid levels on a percentage basis and then of course capital is much smaller than sun sun was about 1 8 billion portfolio actually 1 6 billion portfolio sorry and we ve got a fraction of that in capital so it really won t present the headwind david bishop fig partners llc analyst got it and then one follow up in terms of the quarterly losses in terms of the your favorite banquet hall facility that s now in the past should we expect that drag in terms of the fee income line the 837 000 loss on real estate operations to basically go away or just be immaterial amount christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer that is correct this is the primary motivations we never wanted to be in that business and we re glad to be out of it but i will say i m glad that we handled that the way we did it was a significant employer in a local community where we do a lot of business we thank the municipality we thank a lot of people in that area and we were able to make a difference not a big financial impact to us michael j fitzpatrick executive vice president chief financial officer and dave out of that 800 000 600 000 was directly related to the property that we sold so there s always going to be a little bit of recurring cost for other oreo that comes on and off our books david bishop fig partners llc analyst got it thanks mike operator and the next question comes from russell gunther with davidson please go ahead with your question russell gunther d a davidson co analyst hey good morning guys christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer good morning russell russell gunther d a davidson co analyst i wanted to circle back to the loan growth conversation appreciate the color about your plans for 2019 and the strategy there as we think about the back half of the year and that 100 million target how should we think about the mix of that growth consumer and resi re has been pretty strong of late but as we look toward the back half of last year with the commercial initiatives you talked about how would that mix change if at all christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think that you should think about our residential and consumer line at a very slow trends like it has been in the past it will not accelerate we re not looking to put a lot more in the balance sheet there that s a nice risk mitigant for us it s a great product for our customers and it is a product that we find to be profitable in our model that we ve funded with long term core deposits so the incremental growth to the extent we re able to do it would be in the commercial lines and it would be a combination of investor cre owner occupied cre and c i with the waiting in the real estate categories the we love c i we re trying to push that all the time but we also recognize that there is a lot of appetite for c i out there and it s probably one of those asset classes you got to be most careful about now because new entries are coming into the market that may not have the historical context the credit discipline to in some cases it s pricing in some cases it s structure but there is some c i relationships out there that while we love to have them but we can t have them on the terms that they re available to us russell gunther d a davidson co analyst got it okay great and then just circling back to the margin comment expecting the margin to remain in a range around current levels are you thinking about that relative to the 3 68 this quarter and if you could share with us what you re baking in there from any expectations for the fed to raise rates and also if you could comment what you d expect from the margin were the fed to be on pause going forward christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer sure so we have a relatively balanced position from an interest rate risk standpoint the 3 68 is kind of where we say we ll bounce around that number going forward we continue to have and the rate of balance sheet is growing today which is not much the rotation of fed increases get passed through to our floating rate loans and they impact our deposits a little bit and the net is we re a little better off at the end of the day so the accretion is related to purchase accounting is rolling off and the natural nim is coming up in the event in the back half of the year we were able to significantly increase the growth rate and hit those 100 million numbers that s an opportunity potentially to drive the margin a little better because we still think funding is in very good shape we re not seeing we don t have any concerns about our funding base so we re able to hold funding where it is we have a little bit of excess deposit capacity in balance sheet today as we fold capital in their loan to deposit ratio of 67 gives us more capacity and then of course we think we can actually grow deposits if we need to if we ve got good loans to put them in so back half of the year if loan growth picks up i think you could see little upside in the nim but absent that i think we re pretty steady and the situation doesn t change much whether there is fed hikes or not if the fed hikes come we pass them through on our floating rate loans our deposits go up a little bit and it s about neutral and if the fed rate doesn t come and both of those things don t happen and wind up again pretty neutral russell gunther d a davidson co analyst got it okay great color there thank you and then last one from me would be any update mike on the tax rate outlook for 2019 and 2020 michael j fitzpatrick executive vice president chief financial officer it would be as we ve said in the past 19 would be our expected rate russell gunther d a davidson co analyst thanks guys for taking my questions christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer all right thanks russell operator and the next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw please go ahead with your question collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst thanks good morning guys just curious joe how many commercial lenders do you guys currently have joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer we re over 20 at the moment and every day it seems that i m adding lenders and of course so i think that s a great thing for us and as we expand the geography further into philadelphia and then eventually new york city i expect that number to continue to rise every quarter collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst and i guess that was going to be my next question kind of where do you see that your team of lenders sort of leveling out or how are you kind of thinking about the staffing outlook here joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer we like to say internally that every year when we budget for staff that we have a budget for every position except for lenders commercial lenders so if we find good commercial lenders we ll hire them what we ve also done and we hold our folks accountable we also look at those performance issues when we have them and so we re constantly calling through the staff and making sure that we re optimally structured based on performance so i don t know collyn i would tell you that we tend to try to focus on hiring one to two strong lenders every quarter i think we ll probably over the last two months we ve hired a few i think we ll probably may outpace that in the first quarter of 2019 collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay so i was just trying to gauge so the comments with the focus on building out philadelphia as well as new york city so it s not like you re going to meaningfully scale your team of lenders it s more just having your current folks give them a little bit more latitude to start to grow their portfolios or just trying to think multiple speakers joseph j lebel executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah it s a little bit more nuanced than that in the past i would tell you as we ve grown the company we ve tried to focus on adding a lender or two in geographies we ve gotten enough scale in certain geographies now where the approach needs to be a little bit more top down to try to hire us a team leader or someone of even higher significance so the regional president role comes to mind because we re geographically structured as a company and then having those folks that are known in those markets especially philadelphia and new york drive the recruitment activity collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay that s helpful and then just thinking about chris the idea here that kind of expanding your wings a little bit into the new york city geographies or geographies maybe where there s a little bit better growth prospects than your legacy market how do you think about m a i mean it seems like this would be a great opportunity for you to even accelerate m a or even do larger deals or i mean you just seem to be in a pretty good spot from that standpoint how are you thinking about that any differently as you move into these sort of higher growth markets christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer we would look i would use the like the capital example where that might have been a little bit smaller than something we would like to find it checked all boxes and i think we showed we ll close that we ll go from announcement to close in roughly 90 days on that so i think we ve gotten pretty good at taking the risk out of acquisitions integrating them hitting our expense targets and then also adding both customer bases as well as lenders as part of that so we have our eyes open i think we have the opportunity we have that s one of the reasons that we are choosing to keep little more capital on the balance sheet right letting our tce ratio drift up gives us the opportunity if we wanted to find something interesting we d go ahead and do that that said it s an interesting time in m a because you do have a few people that i think would be heavily interested in finding a partner but typically many of those have a balance sheet issue right it could be an interest rate issue it could be something like that and that doesn t necessarily advance our business so although it may be viable it may not advance the business so it has to be the right thing the other thing i think comes into m a is the mentality around price expectations and it s very hard probably for ceos but especially for boards to say hey you know i m going to accept a price today that may be 20 lower than i was trading at eight months ago but the reality is that s probably the right price for the company today but it s a really hard thing for people emotionally to let go of what my value was four months or five months ago so i think we ve got the capacity to do it i think we ve got the team to do it i think we re demonstrating that as we do things like capital as quickly and efficiently as we have but the circumstances have to be right the right franchise and pricing has to be right if you think about our currency our currency is not valued at what it was 60 days ago i know it s an industry issue as well but we have to be thoughtful about if i m going to print the share for something i better print the share that s really going to pay back my shareholders so i think we re open to it we love that opportunity but we re also realistic that if that doesn t happen we think we can make real progress organically and on the organic side i d add we re making a small number of hires in philadelphia and new york to establish our beachheads to get comfortable with that these are markets that we both know from having worked in and in case of philadelphia having studied pretty hard over the last couple of years we wanted to be thoughtful about when we enter we re seeing loan rates at a point where we think the incremental expansion of our balance sheet makes sense so stage 1 is establishing our presence there once we have a presence there as joe pointed out and this is i think really critical we re looking at this saying we want to attract the leaders in these geographies that will then do that additional hiring under their wing in 2019 i think we ve been kind of reasonably conservative about what our expectations are if you play this forward into 2020 and 2021 each of those geographies individually have the opportunity to add a tremendous amount of growth to our balance sheet so i think we have access to markets that we re going to start to take advantage of collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay that s very helpful and then just lastly on the buyback what are some of the thresholds that will determine kind of how aggressive or not aggressive you ll be on the buyback going forward christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer so we look at the buyback of our own shares a lot like we look at the an acquisition or the purchase of somebody else s company so tangible book dilution is really important to us and earn back periods are important to us so if you were to look at kind of the earnings trajectory we re on and the price of the stock today and i would imagine if a lot of smart people put their models together their model would look a lot like ours in terms of earn back horizons and we typically get pretty conservative as earn backs at the five year mark now i would say as opposed to an acquisition where we look for earn backs to be in the three year mark with us we know we re buying we re buying ourselves so we would stretch out a little bit further i would note that the buybacks that occurred in the fourth quarter were limited due to dependency of the capital bank shareholder vote which prevented us from making additional share repurchases during that so as we go forward with that being behind us and we get into the further into the quarter and window opens up for us we have the opportunity to maybe do some more meaningful buybacks collyn gilbert keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay that s helpful i ll leave it there thanks guys christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator operator instructions and our next question comes from erik zwick with boenning scattergood please go ahead with your question mr zwick your line is live erik zwick boenning scattergood inc analyst can you hear me now christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer yes we can sorry hey erik erik zwick boenning scattergood inc analyst great good morning everyone first just a question about your comments about creating a loan syndication desk can you just provide a little color maybe on your decision to create this desk maybe how many people it will involve and whether you re sourcing them internally or externally christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer sure so not surprising given the growth of the company our participations both bought and sold have tended to be an effort that s risen out of our line commercial lenders and maybe peer to peer relationships we have with a couple of banks but we didn t have an established place in the bank it was the sole owner for all of this business and any decisions we would make so they d run through the normal credit processes and go through credit committee and we d kind of make a decision on a one off basis our book is not giant today it s only a couple of hundred million we don t think we re going to change that dramatically but we do think that given the number of participations we have and the way the process works for us you would expect the more mature commercial bank to have a lead person in a process and a desk and everything flow through that so i think there s the opportunity for a little bit of growth there but i would be careful to signal this is not a giant effort and it s not going to add a lot of dollars to the balance sheet so we have one professional who s got a deep background in this who s been doing this kind of work for 30 years he joined us just a couple of weeks ago and he will be able to both strengthen the existing participations function that we have today and allow us to do some business that as we re better organized we might be able to do more of so i wouldn t look at this and say it s going to be a big component of the balance sheet it s not a high value business in and of itself but when you think about the excess deposits we have today there are more effective ways that we could deploy those into commercial loans even on a short term basis until we win them out in our relationship deals so it s more of an institutionalization and upgrade to what we have a little bit of growth on top of that it s not a giant effort it s not going to be a group of people erik zwick boenning scattergood inc analyst that s helpful i appreciate the explanation and then next on your comments that you expect the deposit beta to be lower going forward versus what you experienced in 4q i guess what gives you the confidence that you ll be able to hold the line christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer i m going to be careful our forward visibility is fairly limited right so i think we remain very close to our customers and we kind of get the ebb and flow of what they re thinking about in terms of deposit rates and the needs to get a return on their money we have a very large commercial cash management portfolio it s about 40 of the bank s deposits and some of those deposits are held in significantly large relationships so what we opted to do after we had a couple of conversations in the last six months or so is work with a few of those customers who may have had excess cash positions that they were beginning to think about either taking out of the bank or optimizing and we were able to put together structures that said look given the totality of the relationship here s how we re going to price your relationship in a way that both makes you comfortable and in return we re getting longer term commitments that they re going to stay with us so we went through that process in the commercial cash management book over the last several months but in earnest probably really in november and december and it was a defensive process to make sure that we were doing everything we can for our customers we have gotten through the major customers in that process as of 12 31 so the cost of deposits is a little higher as of 12 31 that ll carry forward a little bit into the first quarter but that s what you saw little higher beta in the fourth quarter it was a little bit of a catch up that is retrospective not prospective and in fact having negotiated a lot of that out with our clients i think we re in a good position at least for the next quarter or so that said in this kind of environment you ll be very careful about understanding what the price demands will be on your deposits i don t think you can see much more than 90 days 120 days erik zwick boenning scattergood inc analyst great thank you for taking my questions christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and the next question comes from joe gladue with alden securities please go ahead with your question joe gladue alden securities analyst good morning christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer good morning joe gladue alden securities analyst yeah pardon me if you covered this already i missed it but just wondering on the service charges and fees last quarter there was i guess some waivers to the sun bancorp customers just wondering if the full impact of those coming off was seen in the fourth quarter results are there still some additional upward bias to that figure going forward christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer there s not an upward bias i think it s about where you would expect it to be i would say in the third quarter we had some swap fee income that was a little higher than normal so there was a little bit extra in the third quarter and that will be a little lumpy we may have that on and off from quarter to quarter but from the deposit fee perspective i think we re at a steady state joe gladue alden securities analyst that s it from me thank you christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer all right thank you joe operator operator instruction and the next question comes from don koch with koch investments please go ahead with your question donald l koch koch investments llc analyst hey guys congratulations on 22 years of consecutive quarterly cash dividend that s a brilliant remark i mean that s very that s a hallmark that you should take an applause for so my question is christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer it s our entire life as a public company so thank you donald l koch koch investments llc analyst good well we ve been with you for at least more than that or anyhow my basic questions are strategic not tactical so tactically you are doing a brilliant job of increasing your penetration and your sandbox my concern is the right side of the balance sheet and the strategic notion that you want to have a low decay rate and a very low cost by a good retail right side of the balance sheet and in that regard the last time we had a conversation you were talking about major investment into sort of some kind of digital system where you had 24 hour telephone tellers helping seniors do something in areas that you wanted to be both offensive and defensive and assumptions of my question is you re playing brilliantly in the sandbox and you re getting penetration but the sandbox is actually contracting because you re in major areas that are out migrating i mean if you d go forward 10 years you re seeing people go in different regions michigan lost 1 million people california lost people that s basically high tax states and places like florida are gaining 1 000 people a day have you ever thought about following your customer base i know we ve had this discussion but at least a beachhead to take all those wonderful people who are in both philadelphia and new jersey and ocean and whiting and who migrate so you protect that and you keep that right side of the balance sheet with no decay rate at very low cost i mean how are you addressing my worry is that in the next five to 10 years that right side of the balance sheet won t be nearly as stable as you had hoped it would be because you re doing such a great job on the left side of the balance sheet so give me your thoughts on that please christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer sure the first is i would focus on your opening comments about digital and you mentioned one or two of the technologies we offer but we made a significant investment in digital in things wide and far so the investment in digital particularly in the consumer side is engineered to do a few things first to retain the customers we have so we think it s been a great job especially in the context of us having to consolidate as many branches as we have but we ve consolidated 34 branches in the last couple of years and kept our customers so that was a tremendous value creator for the company and digital allows you to allows you to span more geographies so i think over time once we feel we ve got digital really strong in our core footprint it would lend itself to expanding the market definition the second thing is we talked a lot about the commercial lending beachheads in new york and philadelphia and we are acutely aware that you ve got to be careful about geographies and to not have your business overly reliant on a single geography the first step in those metropolitan areas will be commercial loans but as we build out those areas i expect we ll do commercial cash management and then following commercial cash management especially if we have digital capabilities it will be easier to get a foothold in those markets and i would want to make sure that we ve done the best we can i ll use your sandbox analogy we want to be really great in our sandbox i think we can push the borders of our sandbox across the hudson river and across the delaware river and we ll do that slowly methodically and carefully but as much as we love our customers to spend some time in florida or arizona wherever they are i think we re going to preserve our capital and our investments to be closer to home for them donald l koch koch investments llc analyst okay thank you that s it christopher d maher chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back

amman an international monetary fund imf mission is scheduled to start a visit to the kingdom today to conduct the second review of the national economy s performance the finance ministry announced on saturday in a statement carried by the jordan news agency petra the ministry said that the visit is part of a process related to the financial and structural reform programme that jordan implements in coordination with the global lending institution the members of the mission are due to meet with finance minister ezzeddine kanakrieh central bank of jordan cbj governor ziad fariz and technical officials at the ministry and the central bank as well as other officials in relevant public departments the ministry said it is expecting the imf s technical team to begin preparatory meetings on sunday at the ministry and the cbj anticipating the visit to the kingdom to last for two weeks earlier this month prime minister omar razzaz met with imf managing director christine lagarde during a visit to washington during which they discussed the latest developments in the imf backed fiscal reform programme jordan and the imf signed a 36 month 700 million extended fund facility eff programme in 2016 under which the two sides agreed on six conditions that aim at reducing public debt to safe levels and stimulating the economy the controversial income tax law which went into effect at the beginning of this year is part of fiscal reforms under the programme and its endorsement was a necessary step for conducting the second review of the economy under the eff programme jordan s debt to gdp ratio dropped last year for the first time in a decade to 94 per cent compared with 94 3 per cent at the end of 2017 prime minister omar razzaz said earlier this week the overall public debt stood at jd28 6 billion by the end of last october according to the finance ministry s latest figures following her meeting with razzaz lagarde said in press remarks that sustaining fiscal consolidation remains critical to preserve macroeconomic stability which needs to be supported by a faster implementation of reforms to promote jobs and investment and lower business costs
his remarks come after a group of chinese ceo s and policymakers attended the world economic forum wef in davos switzerland sending a message that china is still capable of driving global demand for raw materials and energy despite gloomy forecasts by some economists during the meetings in davos zhang jin of china s 16th largest company cedar holdings said beijing s structural reforms could potentially reverse the fading momentum in the country s gdp growth zhang said an ongoing expansion of china s consumer market could produce an acceleration in the broader national economy china can generate its own domestic consumption which can drive its own economy to grow better zhang said according to china s national bureau of statistics the nation s economy grew 6 6 per cent last year with its total gdp hitting 13 28 trillion although the data points to a slowdown from 2017 last year s pace of expansion was above beijing s target of 6 5 per cent for his part premier li reiterated that beijing s ongoing reforms are expected to spur economic growth as soon as this year the chinese government recently announced plans to cut taxes provide commercial banks with additional liquidity and keep gains in property prices subdued therefore we are fully confident and capable of keeping economic growth rate within an appropriate range in spite of multiple risks and challenges in 2019 the chinese premier said li also reaffirmed beijing s commitment to opening up its economy by relaxing rules and regulations for foreign companies operating in the chinese market and by easing foreign investment rules and capital controls read more us china business tensions may slow trade growth for latin america imf he also said that this year china will improve its regulations related to intellectual property and technology streamline administrative proceedings and boost the quality of services provided to international businesses china welcomes all competitive commodities and technology in the world and we will strictly protect intellectual property rights and speed up the market transformation of innovation results li said moreover he highlighted declining unemployment high economic output and better environmental standards as some of the achievements of beijing s economic policies read more china details upcoming fiscal stimulus touts stable gdp growth however some economists are not convinced that china can reverse its ongoing economic slowdown they point to the high debt accrued by chinese companies provincial governments and the central government itself another challenge is china s questionable practice of shadow banking which might suggest that many private sector enterprises have hidden debt off their balance sheets this speculation albeit partially confirmed by some assessments including form the international monetary fund imf hinders investor appetite for chinese assets but li dismissed the allegations insisting the chinese economy remains healthy meanwhile a separate survey by reuters found the majority of international economists to believe the chinese economy could further slow down to 6 3 per cent this year this however doesn t contradict li s remarks as officials in beijing said earlier this month they expect gdp growth to fall into the 6 0 6 5 per cent range in 2019

morning will be on our financial results under the old standard asc 605 which will allow for comparability on an apples to apples basis as well as comparisons to our original 2019 financial guidance after this discussion of our first quarter results we will review our updated guidance which now reflects the adoption of asc 606 with that introduction let me now turn the call over to john john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer thanks mary kay good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today q1 was another successful quarter for hill rom we started the year with continued momentum accelerating core revenue growth and driving solid operational execution resulting in financial performance that exceeded expectations on both the top line and the bottom line in addition to these strong results we continue to make great progress in our strategic priorities advancing our category leadership with differentiated innovative healthcare solutions expanding our category presence our geographic presence in emerging markets and transforming the portfolio to enhance outcomes and drive value for patients caregivers and our shareholders for the first quarter we reported core revenue growth of 6 reflecting continued progress and benefits from establishing a more durable and diversified business this represents our third consecutive quarter of mid single digit growth our focus on operational execution led to margin expansion of 110 basis points and we delivered adjusted earnings of 1 03 per diluted share an increase of 12 versus the prior year this represents our 14th consecutive quarter of double digit earnings growth importantly this strong performance provides flexibility to reinvest in our key growth initiatives and sets a solid foundation for achievement of both our short term and long term financial objectives our teams are doing an excellent job executing on our vision and our four strategic priorities aimed at enhancing our global category leadership to drive durable sustainable top line and bottom line growth their first priority is advancing our category leadership with differentiated solutions and innovation as i mentioned before new product revenue is a key metric in measuring the success of our strategy and meeting our objectives of driving core revenue growth 200 basis points to 300 basis points above our weighted average market growth rate the contribution of new products was a significant driver of top line growth in q1 once again with revenue of approximately 100 million on track with our expectation of driving 400 million in new product revenue for 2019 supporting this performance were several new innovative products including centrella connex vital signs spot monitor the monarch airway clearance system integrated table motion and our vision care portfolio in total eight new products represent 90 of new product revenue our connected innovations are focused on addressing challenges faced by our customers these challenges include escalating costs lower reimbursement and the need for innovation to enhance efficiency workflow and patient outcomes while preventing events like falls sepsis and pressure ulcers that may cause readmissions unreimbursed complications or reimbursement penalties we highlighted a number of recent achievements in our press release this morning including a global collaboration with microsoft to bring actionable point of care data and solutions to caregivers in real time as well as the commercial launches of the linq mobile smartphone application and earlysense continuous contact free heart rate and respiratory rate sensing technology we believe continued investments in innovation connectivity and data will allow us to enter new markets and channels creating even more opportunities to drive accelerated growth and value for patients and caregivers in the years ahead getting information to caregivers and proactively anticipating patient needs not only provides clinical and economic value it is central to achieving hill rom s mission turning to our second priority expanding internationally and penetrating emerging markets i m pleased to report we are beginning to see some progress we generated international core revenue growth of 3 this quarter reversing the trend from the second half of last year while still in the early stages of a turnaround we were encouraged by strong double digit growth collectively across asia pacific and latin america emerging markets today account for only 9 of hill rom s total revenue and we are in the process of reinvigorating our commercial operations we have recently added experienced senior leadership in asia pacific and are finalizing our assessment of product categories and go to market strategies to support meaningful growth and acceleration in the region our third strategic priority is transforming the portfolio through m a and portfolio optimization initiatives we thoughtfully considered our product offerings and have divested or exited a number of low growth and lower margin product areas that were not strategic to our growth strategy this has strengthened our portfolio enabled us to focus our energy and resources to drive more durable and consistent revenue growth in the core this diversification and our new product introductions has improved our overall revenue mix this quarter approximately 50 of our revenue is coming from categories that grow at 4 or greater demonstrating progress toward our 2020 goal of achieving 60 of total revenue from these higher growth categories in terms of m a this has been and continues to be an important part of our growth in diversification strategy with improved balance sheet flexibility we re in a strong position to enhance our category leadership and further our growth objectives we continue to deploy capital with a disciplined approach adhering to our rigorous strategic and financial criteria to generate attractive returns our final strategic priority is driving operational execution and strong financial performance we ve previously discussed our business optimization program focused on accelerating growth reducing complexity and improving our cost structure we have made significant progress and we are currently executing on a number of initiatives we expect to drive 50 million of pre tax savings over the next few years these benefits are not included in our long range plan but provide us the financial flexibility to reinvest in key priorities like new products and emerging markets in conclusion we are entering 2019 from a position of strength we are energized by our progress in executing on our four strategic priorities we remain focused on accelerating durable and profitable growth while enhancing margins profitability and generating strong cash flow we are capitalizing on new products advancing our pipeline and expanding in emerging markets we see a clear path to achieving our objectives to deliver innovative healthcare solutions and improve outcomes for patients and their caregivers by advancing connected care now i d like to introduce our new cfo barbara bodem barb is a seasoned finance executive with over 20 years of experience in healthcare barb joins us joins hill rom from mallinckrodt where she served as the senior vice president of finance earlier in her career she worked at hospira as the vice president global commercial finance as well as at eli lilly and company where she held a variety of finance roles in the us and the uk including cfo for lilly oncology with that i ll now turn it over to barb barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer thanks john and good morning everyone for the fiscal first quarter we reported gaap earnings of 0 62 per diluted share these results include after tax special items related to intangible amortization tax reform legislation business optimization and other special charges these results also reflect the adoption of asc 606 the new revenue recognition accounting standard on an adjusted basis excluding special items we reported earnings of 1 02 per diluted share on a comparable basis under the old accounting standard adjusted earnings increased 12 to 1 03 per diluted share exceeding our guidance range of 0 97 to 0 99 per diluted share these results reflect accelerated core revenue growth continued margin expansion and strategic investments to drive future growth as mary kay mentioned our commentary this morning will focus on our first quarter results on a comparable basis to the prior year period before the adoption of asc 606 please use the supplemental schedules posted to our website to follow along now let me briefly walk through the p l before turning to our financial outlook starting with revenue for the fiscal first quarter revenue of 684 million increased 2 on a reported basis and 3 on a constant currency basis core revenue accelerated to 6 exceeding our guidance of approximately 4 growth core revenue growth adjusts for the impact of foreign currency divestitures and non strategic assets we may exit including the surgical solutions international oem business domestic revenue on a core basis increased 7 in the first quarter driven by mid to high single digit growth across all three businesses international core revenue grew 3 in the quarter driven by improved performance in emerging markets and solid growth in patient support systems and front line care moving on to the business segments i will address revenue growth on a constant currency basis only starting with patient support system revenue of 342 million increased 3 and core revenue advanced 8 this represents the strongest growth we ve seen in this business in several years and it was well balanced geographically with strong growth both in the us and internationally for the third consecutive quarter we generated strong double digit growth across our key capital product categories in the us including med surg bed systems clinical workflow solutions and safe patient handling equipment outside of the us core patient support systems revenue increased 7 driven by solid growth in europe and double digit growth in the middle east latin america and asia pacific regions now moving on to front line care revenue increased 5 to 233 million new products including the connex spot monitor the monarch mobile vest and our vision care portfolio continue to be the key drivers domestic revenue increased 5 while international revenue grew 3 with solid performance across europe latin america and asia pacific lastly surgical solutions revenue of 109 million was flat to the prior year while core revenue increased 2 double digit growth in placements of the integrated table motion and solid growth in surgical consumables and patient positioning equipment were partially offset by a decline in the middle east impacted by the timing of capital orders versus last year now turning to the rest of the p l adjusted gross margin of 48 3 improved 60 basis points versus last year reflecting the positive contribution from mix as well as benefits from manufacturing productivity and procurement efforts collectively these factors more than offset the impact of tariffs and raw material inflation r d spending of 33 million increased 3 versus the prior year reflecting our ongoing commitment to innovation and investments in key programs to drive future growth adjusted sg a of 189 million was flat to the prior year as strategic investments were offset by disciplined cost management our adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 15 8 an improvement of 110 basis points compared to the prior year the adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 19 7 stock based compensation was a benefit of 0 03 per diluted share versus a benefit of 0 05 per diluted share last year excluding the impact of stock based compensation our first quarter tax rate was 21 7 so bottom line adjusted earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 1 03 per diluted share increased 12 excluding the impact of stock based compensation from both periods adjusted earnings per share increased 15 now turning to cash flow cash flow from operations was very strong in the first quarter advancing 25 to 116 million higher net income and strong working capital management contributed to this perform capital expenditures totaled 15 million 12 million lower than the prior year period primarily due to project timing as a result free cash flow of 101 million is 53 higher than last year in terms of the balance sheet and financial leverage our debt to ebitda ratio at the end of december was 3 2 ph and we ve returned approximately 92 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the fiscal first quarter now let me conclude this portion of the call by providing our guidance for fiscal 2019 as noted in the press release we are reaffirming our full year revenue growth margin expansion and adjusted earnings per diluted share growth guidance and are updating the adjusted earnings guidance range to solely reflect the adoption of asc 606 the updated 2019 financial guidance now compares to the 2018 modified financial results which are included in our supplemental schedules on the website the impact of asc 606 for fiscal year 2018 is a reduction in reported revenue of 14 million and a reduction in adjusted earnings of 0 10 per diluted share so for the full year we continue to expect reported revenue growth of 1 to 2 in constant currency growth of 2 to 3 core revenue growth is expected to increase 4 to 5 collectively non core revenue totaled approximately 110 million in 2018 and is expected to decline to approximately 50 million in 2019 this headwind is incorporated in our reported revenue guidance while core growth guidance is calculated by excluding the non core components in both the current and prior year period by business segment on a core basis we continue to expect all three businesses to grow in the 4 to 5 range in 2019 on a reported basis given the decline in non core revenue we expect patient support systems revenue to increase 1 to 2 and surgical solutions revenue to be flat to up 1 from a profitability standpoint we continue to expect the following adjusted gross margin to expand approximately 50 basis points reflecting mix and productivity improvements that more than offset incremental costs associated with tariffs and raw material inflation r d spending to increase in mid single digits representing approximately 5 of sales adjusted sg a of 26 to 26 5 of sales reflecting both savings related to our business optimization program and the reinvestment in key growth initiatives adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points other expense including interest of approximately 90 million and a tax rate of 21 to 22 and finally we expect a share count of approximately 67 5 million shares again we are only adjusting our earnings guidance range for the 0 10 impact related to the asc 606 aligned with the estimated impact we disclosed last november this adjustment lowers our previously disclosed adjusted earnings guidance of 5 08 to 5 16 per diluted share to 4 98 to 5 06 per diluted share importantly there is no change in our adjusted earnings growth profile we continue to expect growth of 7 to 9 and 12 to 14 growth excluding stock based compensation from a cash flow perspective we now project operating cash flow of approximately 420 million and capital expenditures of approximately 90 million this change reflects a reclassification related to asc 606 between operating cash flow and capital expenditures our 2019 free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at 330 million for the fiscal second quarter under asc 606 we expect revenue growth to be flat to the prior year and revenue to increase approximately 2 on a constant currency basis we expect core revenue to increase approximately 4 and are providing guidance for adjusted earnings of 1 09 to 1 11 per diluted share this represents growth of 7 to 9 and 9 to 11 growth excluding stock based compensation you may have noticed that the asc 606 impact was immaterial to our first quarter performance as we look forward the calendarization of the impact of 2019 will vary from the impact in 2018 this is primarily due to changes in quarterly revenue mix the timing of shipments and software implementations and the timing of the monarch launch which occurred mid year last year we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to be impacted by more than half of the expected 0 10 full year 2019 impact thank you and now i ll turn the call back over to john john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer thanks barb to summarize we are off to an excellent start this year and look forward to building on that momentum throughout 2019 by executing on our four strategic priorities we are confident that we can sustain the momentum we have delivered over the past three quarters we are committed to delivering durable mid single digit top line growth strengthening our margins and driving double digit earnings growth while delivering on our mission and creating enhanced value for our shareholders with that we will open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions i would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the hill rom website for seven days at www hill rom com our first question comes from the line of larry keusch from raymond james your line is open larry keusch raymond james analyst thank you good morning everyone maybe just two questions but the first one to start is john could you talk a little bit about obviously core growth in the first quarter was really very nicely strong at 6 but the outlook decelerates to 4 in the 2q so and i think the core comps are essentially the same for the 1q and the 2q so could you talk a little bit about thoughts around the deceleration john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah larry good question first we are very pleased with the first quarter results of 6 core growth and a nice progression of acceleration from last year starting the year at 2 in the first half and accelerating in the third and fourth quarter to 4 so good trajectory as we look at our guidance for q2 we are certainly considering all the puts and takes that are occurring in the business one of the things we see in q2 is that we ve got a tougher comp in europe and some other international markets it was a strong quarter last year and we re really just factoring that into the guidance as we look at q2 for the full year we re still very confident with the 4 to 5 guide but for q2 it looks more like a 4 and we re just calling it out to be representative of what we see across the business mary kay ladone senior vice president corporate development strategy and investor relations and larry it s mary kay with the 6 in q1 and 4 in q2 for the first half we re looking at 5 which is at the top end of our 4 to 5 core growth guidance for the year larry keusch raymond james analyst okay got it and then john obviously very encouraging comments around some of the progress being made overseas i know that there have been some geographies that have been challenged for a period of time i guess the question is in that 3 growth that you recorded how durable do you think that is and if you could weave into your answer what are the investments that need to be made into the emerging markets to drive that penetration higher now that you ve had a chance to kind of dig in and think a little bit more about the product portfolio and what needs to be done there john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah it s a great question larry and we re pleased with the start to the year 3 core growth in total international mid single digit in emerging markets at about 5 and double digit growth in the new regions of latin america and asia pac so really solid start to the year as i mentioned earlier q2 represents a tough comp for us in some of our bigger international regions so that s the primary reason for a deceleration in our overall core growth but as i look toward international for the full year we would expect to see acceleration at the end of the year in emerging market growth rates and that is driven by some of the early investments we re making in the organization and aligning ourselves around the key product categories for those regions we re in the final stages now of putting together an investment plan in asia pacific for the emerging markets in asia pacific with obviously china being the biggest opportunity for us we expect to turn on those investments as mentioned before in the second half of the year so the next this current quarter that we re in is all about finalizing those plans and preparing ourselves to turn on those investments we would expect to see those investments really begin to mature about a year later right at the end of our lrp period at the end of fiscal 20 so we re excited about the opportunities they look promising and similar comments in other emerging markets in latin america and as we previously discussed we have shown an ability to drive emerging market growth in regions like the middle east and africa where we ve had over a three year period 18 compounded annual growth rate so our confidence in being able to deliver more consistent durable revenue growth in the emerging markets continues to grow and we re pleased with the early success that we saw in q1 larry keusch raymond james analyst okay terrific thank you operator and bob hopkins of bank of america is on the line with a question please state your question your line is open robert hopkins bank of america analyst well thank you and good morning john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer good morning bob robert hopkins bank of america analyst yeah good morning it really there s a lot of moving pieces here with some of the accounting changes and such but i just wanted to ask a question on the earnings guidance for the year so just i m curious what are you assuming in the new guidance on eps for the impact of stock based comp on earnings and the reason i ask that is that it was my impression from the conversations kind of in the last call that the stock based compensation may actually be an offset to the new accounting change so i guess my question to be very clear is what are you assuming in terms of the impact on eps from stock based comp in this new fiscal 19 guidance barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer i ll take this one hi bob it s barb how are you today thank you for the question with regards to stock based comp if you recall last year we recognized a pretty large benefit from stock based comp about 0 24 or yes 0 24 on the full year when we think about our guidance we don t typically include this in our earnings guidance and last year s 0 24 was really driven by much of the executive changes that were going on something that we don t anticipate seeing a like for like and as you look forward we don t typically try to project what stock based comp benefits are going to be because they re driven by a couple of different factors it s driven by individual choices about when they re going to exercise options it s also driven by market performance as you go along so we have not included stock based comp in our lrp guidance we have not included it in our 2019 either what we gave last november nor what we ve provided today under 606 this just not something that we ve incorporated because we think it s pretty hard to forecast and i m pretty hard to transmit out what we have done is we ve been very transparent about it so quarter by quarter to the extent that we see a benefit if you recall i said earlier that we saw a 0 03 benefit this quarter we ll be transparent about that to the extent that that allows us some reinvestment opportunities in the business we may consider that but we will not include it in the guidance as we go forward as we think about the impact of asc 606 the 0 10 impact that we have shown in the revised adjusted earnings guidance on eps is purely the asc 606 impact so it s looking at what we experienced or what we ve seen in the restatement of 2018 and carried that forward into 2019 and then again i want to reemphasize that as you think about the calendarization of that 0 10 we re anticipating the majority of that to be coming through in q2 john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah and just for the full year then our ex stock based comp for the full year still 12 to 14 growth rate growth rates are not impacted by the asc 606 changes and then in q1 ex stock based comp we had a 15 eps growth rate so i hope that answers your question bob robert hopkins bank of america analyst yeah you know that s very clear i appreciate that so my interpretation of all those comments is that it makes sense not to include it it s hard to predict but all else equal that could be an offset you may choose to invest it depending on how things play out but it s still a potential source of offset at least as i read it john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yes i think that s a good way to read it robert hopkins bank of america analyst okay perfect and then the other comment i wanted to ask was just on surgical solutions in particular because that was the one that was maybe a little weaker than we thought and you called out middle east maybe you could just talk a little bit john about how big is that middle east portion in surgical solutions what was kind of the growth rate this quarter and how long do you think it ll take to turn that around because that s obviously been a source of volatility in the past as well john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah i guess i would start out bob by saying when we put our plan together this is how we expected that surgical business to kind of phase through the year that we knew it s going to be a lighter q1 still confident about our 4 to 5 full year performance there we did have double digit integrated table motion take place internationally but it was offset by some orders that we expected that have come out of in q2 or q3 so it s to us it s what we expected it s not a surprise we re on track and we do have the confidence in the full year guidance of 4 to 5 robert hopkins bank of america analyst perfect ph thank you very much operator and david lewis is on the line of morgan stanley with the question please state your question your line is open david lewis morgan stanley analyst great good morning just a quick follow up for barb and then maybe two for john really quickly barb just taking asc 606 aside in the stock based comp aside i think you re pretty clear there if i just sort of think about the beginning of the year margin is sort of in line with expectations you re kind starting the year kind of above expectations mary kay s commentary in the first half kind of suggest your operating performance is at the top end of your guidance so with margins coming in where they expected and revenue kind of toward the top end of the range why does that necessitate an earnings revision at this time and just update us again on tariffs 0 10 to 0 15 is that still the right number and then a couple for john barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer yeah sure so why don t i start then and we ll talk a little bit about i ll kind of go in reverse order and we ll come back to where we are on our guidance for the year so starting with our margin expansion i d like to take you all the way back to what we said in the long range plan which is that over the long range plan we expected to see an operating margin improvement of about 300 basis points and we delivered 100 basis points last year and our guidance this year is to provide another 100 basis points as you will see that kind of ebbs and flows from quarter to quarter depending on the specific performance in that given quarter of that 100 basis points we would expect about half of that to come from gross margin and the other half of it to come from opex leverage in the rest of the p l and what we saw in q1 was very consistent with that so in q1 we showed the 110 basis points of which 60 was coming through gross margin and the balance of it coming through the rest of the p l of the 60 basis points when we looked at the 60 basis points and when we looked at the guidance for the full year on gross margin we took into consideration tariffs i think we estimated last fall that we thought the headwind from tariffs was going to be about 10 million to 15 million in addition to that as you probably aware we re all experiencing a little bit of inflation on our direct materials as well but what we said is that mix and productivity in gross margin would more than offset that and we would be able to deliver the 50 basis points worth of improvement even after absorbing those as we look at q1 and we look at our experience with the tariffs in q1 it s very consistent with that 10 million to 15 million for the full year and as you know we still have some uncertainty about where tariffs are going to land for the full year as well so as we re thinking about gross margin as we re thinking about our operating margin expansion we re feeling pretty confident and pretty comfortable with where our q1 is and how it fits with our overall guidance so to your question about you know if we re seeing growth at the higher end of it and we re seeing a nice margin expansion in q1 why is it that we re not adjusting our earnings for the full year and i think the answer to that at this point is that it s still very early while we are very excited about and pleased about our performance in q1 it is only the first quarter of a four quarter year and so we have a lot of around to cover and at this point in time we thought it would be to certain to signal any upside to the earnings i hope that answers your question david lewis morgan stanley analyst yes very very clear barb and then just john two kind of one tactical one strategic for me on centrella could you just kind of talk about the contribution centrella to the pipeline this particular quarter how has that changed over the last couple of quarters and from here it is the growth contribution from centrella improved from here and then strategically just the 50 million you talked about a few weeks ago in and above the lrp can you give some sense of sort of as you re thinking right now where those investments go whether it s just the front line care business the communications portfolio or the emerging markets piece where is it likely we see that money go thanks so much john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah thanks david so let me kind of broaden it out a little bit beyond centrella at first and then i ll get into specifics on centrella to the extent i can so for new products first of all as i first said in my prepared comments about 100 million of contribution in q1 from new products what i didn t say is that s an 80 growth rate over the prior year so we really like the momentum we re seeing with new product growth it is contributing significantly to top line overall core growth probably to the tune of something above 300 basis points in first quarter as we look at that total new products category which again consists of eight products that are really driving that overall performance it continues to look promising to us this ability to continue to be that fuel that drives above weighted average market growth rate comfortably of that 200 basis points to 300 basis points so that s the overall characterization of that new product bucket that was specifically with respect to centrella and probably the best way to address that is our med surg category because there is some cannibalization of centrella over other med surg product offerings we saw double digit growth rate in q1 i guess more specifically in the neighborhood of 30 growth so very strong growth we re really excited about the new technology we re bringing into that ecosystem with our new launch of earlysense and watchcare in the case of earlysense we think that s a breakthrough technology non contact twice per second measurement of heart rate and respiratory rate and getting a really a running trend of heart rate respiratory rate to provide actionable insights and early intervention where required to reduce costly complications and life threatening complications so centrella is that digital hub in that ecosystem we re pleased with this progress i m very pleased with engagements since the last time we had a call i visited customers in china visited customers in the united states in europe and in canada and all of them are very excited about the offerings that this product provides them but not just on its own but at the whole ecosystem of sensing technology immediate care communication technology and being able to provide a turnkey solution that we can scale and integrate into their system i think one of the highlights of the last three months is visiting north america s first digital hospital and seeing how they ve incorporated these types of products in that setting with connected vital signs and connected beds and really a command center that really allows them to show significant workflow improvements of 30 plus as well as falls reductions in that same neighborhood so very excited about the response we re seeing from customers around the world on the value that these connected products bring not just as a stand alone but as a complete ecosystem getting to your second question david about the 50 million we have a lot of investment proposals that are coming forward in the organization now neighboring around 30 ph or so we are vetting those as we speak and racking and stacking what those best opportunities look like it ll be a mix between new products and innovation and emerging markets and perhaps a couple of select other investments in commercial operations or clinical studies and clinical data generation so it s a little bit too early to say what exactly those are but certainly with 50 million over the coming years that we ll have to invest we ll be looking to pace new investments as the savings are realized and put you know our best investments forward first as we think about how to deploy that cash but thank you for the question david david lewis morgan stanley analyst thanks john operator and we have matt taylor on the line with ubs please state your question your line is open matt taylor ubs analyst hi good morning thank you for taking the question john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer good morning matt matt taylor ubs analyst so i wanted to good morning i want to ask you about your kind of guidance philosophy just seeing newer with this team understand not raising at this early stage in this year that s certainly prudent i guess could you give us a little bit more color on when you might feel comfortable raising i feel like it s a little bit of an unfair question but if you had a 6 growth rate in the second quarter does that give you enough confidence or maybe you could just talk about with 6 growth this quarter are you getting more confidence that you can actually grow above 4 to 5 or were there just kind of onetime things that helped this quarter john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah great question matt let me reiterate we re very happy about the momentum from 2 a year ago to now up to 6 so clearly organic momentum is driving the portfolio and driving our core growth as we think about providing guidance we re looking at all the puts and takes across the business and i think our philosophy would be summarized pretty simply in three words meet or beat right we re looking at the guidance as a meet or beat number we certainly don t want to disappoint anybody including ourselves so when we look across the portfolio and all the businesses in the regions of all the dynamics that go on in the business as diverse as this i can boil it down to those three simple words that s our view meet or beat barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer and matt this is barb with regards to the timing of when we might revisit q2 is the obvious time so as we get through the second quarter we ll revisit our position and if we have an update we will obviously be sending that out so thanks for the question matt matt taylor ubs analyst thank you i just had one follow up i was wondering if you could expand on some of the cost savings initiatives that you ve laid out here it seems like they re kind of coming into focus can you talk about any that you have prioritized that will be helping margins sooner or anything that s changed sequentially to give us some flavor for the initiative that you ll be executing on here in the back half of the year john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah sure matt i ll start with that question and hand it over to barb for additional comments we re kicking those off right now it s going on a multiple fronts so they re a couple of very i ll point it three big ones one is continue the consolidation of our manufacturing footprint more recently we ve begun to consolidate some of our r d centers so we can concentrate our r d in centers of excellence around the businesses and around specific areas such as digital and software development so that is under way as we speak and the third one is really the whole category of just spending more wisely on everything from meetings to consulting to outside services and travel et cetera things we call indirect spend that s the third kind of big bucket that we re pursuing as we progress and because of the decentralized nature of the company we re able to execute on multiple fronts with respect to of manufacturing footprint or reorganizations like the ones i mentioned so those are the first three that i would point out and as you look over the three year period it s relatively evenly spread between the three year period in terms of when we see the savings a lot of it gets kicked off this fiscal year or we begin to realize it at the second half of this year and then annualize it more into next year as it rolls out any additional comments barb you would add barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer the only other thing i would add is that what you don t see and so you see relatively say well we ve got 3 growth in our r d spend we ve got flat sg a in particular in the flat sg a what s not visible is the fact that we are actively repurposing investments within that flat sg a so we ve taken some actions that have really brought down our g a area spend so that we can turn around and reinvest that in selling and marketing activities or commercial activities and other areas so some of the changes we re making are really not going to be visible in the p ls the expense lines as you see it because it s all happening in the redirection and the realignment of the spend that we have i hope that s helped in giving a little extra color matt taylor ubs analyst it does thank you so much for all that operator and we have rick wise of stifel on the line with a question please state your question your line is open frederick wise stifel nicolaus company analyst good morning john maybe just help us think about the current new product pipeline obviously r d spending has gone up sort of in the neighborhood of 5 clearly new products are making a difference sort of two questions about it one today what percentage of the pipeline of the new product revenue you re generating is capital and do you related like centrella but what s next and how is that pipeline changing likely to change and evolve over the next few years john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah good question rick i mean if i look at our new product revenue to specifically answer your question about how much of it is capital it s probably in the neighborhood of about 15 maybe 20 the most but it looks like around 15 of the eyeballs the numbers in front of me here that s actually consistent with our frames business our bed frames is 20 of our total revenue today so it s proportionately similar to our current mix or a little bit less capital dependent if i think about the future of what we re looking forward to we ve talked about four key product launches this year with linq mobile as part of our cws or clinical communications portfolio watchcare which is our incontinence detection device with a consumable recurring revenue stream business earlysense which is our heart rate respiratory rate monitoring in the bed and then retinavue next generation the first three are already launched or in the early phases of launch we re getting great feedback on all of those they haven t really had the dollared impact in terms of new products yet because they re really in the early phases but each of those three linq watchcare and earlysense we expect those to grow substantially over the coming quarters and couple of years here the one is not yet launched is our retinavue next generation product which is really a point and click easy to use our retinal scanning device and that s expected to come in the second half of this fiscal year so we feel good about what s in that portfolio of the eight products that drive 90 of the new products basket and then four new products coming into it this year as well as a pipeline of additional innovation that we have not yet disclosed looking very promising at driving category leadership in these seven strategic focus categories that we ve outlined most recently in the j p morgan presentation those seven focus areas and categories represent about 26 billion of total available market to us so we ve got a lot of room to grow in in these seven strategic categories that we ve outlined many of which have nice growth rates above the overall weighted average market growth rate for the company frederick wise stifel nicolaus company analyst that s very helpful second question just sort of a multipart and it s really for both you and barbara just maybe you could just talk through i d like to hear both your perspectives on barbara you re a new cfo walking in the door both of you are building on the great work and foundation that john greisch and steve did barbara what are your key priorities you talked about sg a sort of repurposing and efficiencies what do you think are the key opportunities over and above what we may know about the company priorities john i d be hear happy to hear your perspective and maybe the second part of the question is given the significant reduction in leverage and balance sheet improvement and cash flow growth john you ve been in place for a while now how are you thinking about m a i heard you promoted a rockstar biz dev strategy kind of person how are you tasking that excellent individual what can we expect on the m a front and portfolio front thank you john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer yeah thanks for the question rick and i don t know if i m a rockstar or not but well time will tell and you can review us and judge but i don t aspire to be a rock star so when it comes to m a and it kind of feeds into my priority at this point i do feel very good about the operational execution of the organization i feel very good about the leadership team both my immediate leadership team as well as a broader leadership team and i feel very good about our ability to continue to deliver mid single digit top line growth organically so a lot of time and attention is now being directed toward m a we are looking for accretive acquisitions accretive to growth accretive to our growth profile improving the profile of the company that drives higher growth rates higher profitability and gives us the kind of returns on the investments around m a that we are looking for and we ll be rigorous and disciplined around so that s where i m spending my time obviously can t comment on things that are speculative at this point but i would say in general i do like the pipeline that we re developing of opportunities we re engaging on multiple fronts around m a they re are going to be supportive and you re going to if we get something done you ll i think see a very clear strategic fit of how these acquisitions would fit into these product categories that we ve identified as strategic to us and i think you ll see that they re going to be accretive to the overall growth of the company so that s where i m spending my time rick in addition to everything else that you would expect me to spend time on barb barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer so rick great question and i appreciate you asking it it has been not quite two months for me but it s been a very good two months and i ve been very impressed with the organization and how focused the organization is on the strategic priorities that john outlined for everybody earlier today it s embedded in the cadence of how we operate everyday when i think about where am i going to be spending my time clearly from an m a perspective externally doing everything with my team to make sure we re supporting the m a process and that we re doing the right deals that are going to drive the future growth of the company growth is also where i ll be focusing from an internal standpoint it s really about making sure our resources are lined up to the best opportunities that we have over the past few weeks have had the opportunity to really get a view of our internal innovation pipeline and it s very impressive and so making sure that we are funding that appropriately moving things forward is key making sure that as we look at our internal resource allocation that we are as streamlined and efficient in those areas that are not business facing or not driving growth so that we can free up resources for those areas where they will drive growth is going to be a key agenda and area for us it s not new from what steve was doing but it ll be a particular area of focus for me i hope that helps give you some insight into where my head is frederick wise stifel nicolaus company analyst thank you so much barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer lisa we have time for just one more question this morning operator our final question will come from kristen stewart of barclays please state your question your line is open kristen stewart barclays analyst hey everybody thanks for taking the question bard welcome to the first call ph just to go back i guess more of a couple of clarifying questions so when you are talking about flat year over year growth for the second quarter is that going to be also on a asc 606 revised basis is that fair or is that flat versus asc 605 barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer kristen it s barb thanks for the welcome excited to be here all of our guidance going forward is under 606 so the only time we were going to do anything under 605 is helping you understand q1 2019 performance go forward is only 606 so when we talked about guidance for q2 we said it would be flat on a reported basis 2 on a constant currency and then looking at 4 from a core growth for the quarter all under 606 and remember that i also flagged that we do think we ll see a disproportionate impact from an eps perspective of the 606 change in q2 mary kay ladone senior vice president corporate development strategy and investor relations and kristen this is mary kay just to clarify you do need to update your models for the 2018 modified results that s the base for 2q under 606 kristen stewart barclays analyst okay that s what i thought so it s flat off of that call it 706 million revenue the kind of restated asc 606 number mary kay ladone senior vice president corporate development strategy and investor relations yes that is correct kristen stewart barclays analyst okay and then the eps was lowered by 0 03 under asc 606 a year ago but you re basically saying the benefit is going to be greater and that s one of the things driving the little bit lower eps relative to expectations it also looks like margins are going to be little bit lower than at least the full year run rate is there any kind of thing causing that or they re just timing of investments or effects of anything you can speak to into why margins might be a little bit lower in 2q as well or maybe that s all it barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer i think when we re looking at q2 and we re looking at margins for the quarter margins are going to be driven by multifactorial sort of thing the mix of the products that we re projecting for the second quarter and that mix does fluctuate a little bit from quarter to quarter as well as timing of initiatives as well as headwinds so there s a lot of different moving pieces in there i don t know that you can draw any straight conclusions between 606 and the margin for the second quarter kristen stewart barclays analyst okay and then just to kind of go back i guess to beginning conversation not to beat a dead horse but the stock based comp was 0 03 in the quarter you re kind of keeping the guidance if i m hearing kind of how you responded back to everyone else s comments should we just think about you guys just really targeting kind of that range for the full year and to the extent there s additional stock based comp more of a willingness to kind of reinvest those opportunities and along the same lines with the 50 million in savings that you ve talked about should we just think about that as something that just automatically will get reinvested and not necessarily be additive to the lrp barbara w bodem senior vice president chief financial officer kristen thanks thanks for the question and thanks for the opportunity to clarify back on the sbc side first of all from an lrp perspective and from a fiscal year perspective again we don t forecast the sbc which you know also on the business optimization that is not it is incremental to what we have in the lrp with the goal of reinvesting all of that so when we think about the guidance these two things are not things that we would have factored into achieving the eps guidance that we ve laid out either in the long range plan or for 2019 when you think about how are we looking at sbc for the remainder of the year again i believe that it s a good position to not try to forecast that out and put it in the guidance to the extent that we are seeing benefits and we re seeing those benefits early enough in the year where we can do something with those benefits we will look for reinvestment opportunities to the extent that the timing of when we see the sbc benefits come through and when we have investment opportunities within the quarter and within the fiscal year don t align then that will end up being potentially incremental to our guidance for the full year did that help kristen stewart barclays analyst yes it does thanks so much john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer thanks kristen operator i ll now turn the call back over to john groetelaars for closing remarks john p groetelaars president and chief executive officer well thanks and thanks for all the great questions and engagement this morning i guess summary comments was would be look things have never been better we ve gone from a 2 growth in core growth in first half of 18 4 q3 4 q4 last year coming into this year with 6 the organic growth engine is alive and working well we feel very confident about our ability to deliver mid single digit top line growth that s consistent durable in addition to that i think we ve shown over 14 quarters our ability to deliver double digit adjusted eps so we re confident in our guidance for q2 and are confident in our guidance for the full year and i want to thank you for all your time and attention this morning operator ladies and gentlemen

local mailbag news press com stop littering we are inundated with litter while riding my bicycle in bonita and naples i see it on the roadsides in drainage ditches canals and near the ocean i ve been picking it up but one person can t fix this problem to those who litter stop it is an assault on our beautiful environment i believe we need a community effort police involvement a public awareness campaign and more folks who are willing to collect debris in their neighborhoods all business owners condo associations etc should have someone pick up the trash around and in front of their property on a regular basis i suggest the use of a pick stick lastly people hauling things in their trucks need to secure the loads they carry dorothy kunkel bonita springs more the world has gone to the dogs literally your say dysfunctional democracy why has our democracy become dysfunctional what kind of democracy gives individual citizens voting in states with small populations more weight than those voting in large populated states it s called the electoral college what kind of democracy gives only one member in the congress the authority to start a vote the speaker of the house and the majority leader in the senate are the only members that can bring a bill up for a vote this is what we re taught in public school represents democracy if anyone is interested in what a real democracy looks like check out roberts rules of order on the internet wikipedia wars in north korea vietnam afghanistan iraq and syria on the credit card at the same time huge reductions in tax revenues have generated our debt to be almost equal to our gdp the total goods and services produced in the u s our citizens feel economically insecure and our permanent residents who are not citizens are also insecure on top of all this our government appears to lie to us more frequently than telling us the truth enough for dysfunctionality martin harris cape coral true colors several russian companies were hit with sanctions in retaliation for their blatant interference in american elections among those affected were companies owned by russian oligarch oleg deripaska an ally of vladimir putin the trump administration has sought on many fronts to lift the sanctions or not enforce them when rick scott freshman senator from florida cast his vote in the u s senate to ease these sanctions in support of trump and deripaska he showed his true colors turns out to be pink kudos to sen marco rubio who in a rare moment of courage and bravery defended the united states against russian enemies bent on undermining our democracy broke with republicans and voted to uphold the sanctions it s past time for sen rubio s colleagues in congress to show their true colors and join him in taking a stand for the red white and blue susan stranahan fort myers history repeating in these tumultuous times one must look back to history to understand how and why we are here economically and politically in the early 1900s america was ruled by standard oil u s steel morgan and vanderbilt their monopoly touched everything and everybody their wealth power and reach was unrivaled and unchecked their dominance ruled the economy and politics and it took a disruptor like teddy roosevelt to break up this power cartel today the world is run by google facebook microsoft apple and buffet their power is based on capturing information it buys it it sells it it manipulates it and is more powerful than the titans of industry 100 years ago their wealth and power reaches into our homes work play health care religion and politics this uncontrolled reach shapes our thoughts our economy and our very lives the proof is in the enormous wealth and status they have attained they are co conspirators in election tampering they control the news information and access and when confronted by competition they buy it i urge another disruptor to break up this monopoly before the intrusion of ai becomes god i fear for our economy our freedom our privacy and our very lives jack holt cape coral contrary to law the supreme court s decision in roe v wade was predicated at least in part i m quite sure on a court of appeals case in new york that held that a separately identifiable human being could not exist before viability which has been considered the seventh month of pregnancy medical science has been able to increase that time but not by much if one elects to think otherwise they are welcome to do so but they are not welcome to force their beliefs on the rest of us to hold that human life exists from the time of conception is contrary to the law and it is the law that must govern a belief contrary to that must certainly be based on religious belief and that runs up against the separation of church and state as to the ramifications of these folks position my wife asked a very practical question would these protesters want to take care of all these unwanted babies samuel alessi fort myers wall distracts the wall was originally supposed to be a fix for flat middle class income immigrants steal jobs and depress wages there are other fixes for this spend more on education and job training always a path to upward mobility raise the federal minimum wage a rising sea lifts all boats pass laws to equalize pay for women their incomes are lower too restore a more progressive tax structure the rich are getting too big a share with our regressive taxes spend money for infrastructure construction jobs are blue collar jobs green energy creates more jobs than

schmidt sanibel discredited outsider i suppose i should applaud your striving for inclusivity regarding your mailbag section and the letters that you choose to publish however when you print a letter you ought to as would a fine paper like the washington post include a disclaimer noting that the referenced dr nils axel morner is a discredited outsider whose views are his own and who among other things firmly believes in water dowsing in search of that precious liquid and has some curious and otherwise laughable views on archaeology you could have checked this out in minutes as i did sadly some readers will now believe that this dr morner is to be believed when his erroneous views regarding climate change and ocean level rise are in line with other doubters like rush limbaugh and the president now occupying the oval office your readers are deserving of a clarification david squires estero walls pay a recent writer seems to imply the wall is a poor economic decision and asks some questions the initial economics if we added the wall and security cost to the national debt would be a 0 02 percent increase if we got the top 10 percent taxpayers to pay for it their tax increase would be 0 2 percent for one year so in the grand scheme of things the upfront price of the wall is pretty cheap but i suggest this project is self funding assuming it reduces illegal immigration and i believe it will this in turn should reduce the financial burden placed on social security medicare medicaid welfare and public education currently spent on non u s citizens this does not include the potential reduction in illegal drugs coming over the board or any potential law enforcement savings that might result from fewer illegal immigrants not only does the wall and better border security

scale smugglers a wall is no barrier 2 she cites no evidence for her shocking claim that hundreds of americans perish every day from preventable problems caused by illegal immigration this pattern of claim without evidence fits a sadly familiar pattern of untruth all too often offered and accepted in our national dialogue we must begin to reject it 3 she blames the drug crisis on politicians who

marie antoinette had a fake dairy a laiterie d agrément on the grounds of versailles there the queen and her ladies would dress as dairymaids and pretend to make butter and ice cream the pleasure dairy had fixtures of white marble set against walls painted with trompe l oeil to resemble marble according to butter a rich history by elaine khosrova but the laiterie d agrément was one of two dairies on the grounds of versailles not wishing to eat their own mock preparations marie and her confidantes ate the butter milk and ice cream prepared by real dairy workers at a separate and far less ornate facility on the palace grounds centuries after her summary execution at the age of 37 marie antoinette remains a symbol of profligacy and scorn of the common man while she churned a little possibly inedible butter in her pleasure dairy the last of the milk curdled in jugs across france and women rioted over the price of bread this week speaker of the house nancy pelosi evoked her most famous and apocryphal quote let them eat cake to describe the attitudes of the trump administration towards federal workers furloughed during the longest government shutdown in american history empathy or at least the appearance of it is a baseline political skill and the sundry plutocrats of the trump administration have proved astoundingly poor at it this week alone secretary of commerce wilbur ross a man with a 150 million art collection and a penchant for customized 600 smoking slippers customized with the department of commerce logo said he didn t quite understand why federal employees were lining up for free food at soup kitchens and suggesting they take out loans instead the average american is already saddled with tens of thousands of dollars in debt the washington post reported that the department of commerce s own credit union is charging 9 percent interest on emergency loans for employees who are missing their second paycheck today lara trump the president s daughter in law called a month of no pay a little bit of pain and larry kudlow the administration s top economic adviser described federal employees working for no pay under pain of losing their jobs as volunteers kudlow s net worth is estimated at around 25 million the president himself evinced even less understanding of the consequences of his own actions in comments broadcast on thursday he suggested that grocery stores would work along with federal employees during their weeks of travail presumably giving away food on the promise of future credit trump notably is 72 years old and since leaving the opulence of his trump tower and mar a lago homes except for the odd weekend has had his food served to him by chefs and servants at the white house it has presumably been quite some time since he visited a safeway plus a man who received 413 million from his father can hardly be expected to know what it s like to visit a grocery store with next to nothing in your bank account and your heart in your throat it says something about the sheer ineptitude of the various plutocrats that make up the trump cabinet that they ve made house speaker nancy pelosi the consummate washington insider look like a salt of the earth everywoman pelosi to her credit has kept her caucus firmly in hand visited an impromptu food kitchen created by humanitarian chef jose andres and called out the robber baron coldheartedness of the administration he thinks they can just ask their father for money but they can t she said that s indeed what trump did when the taj mahal his garish atlantic city casino was ailing prior to its 1991 bankruptcy his father fred trump bought 3 5 million in chips and walked out without gambling at all across america 800 000 federal workers and thousands more government contractors have been pinching pennies while trump left them with no idea when the end to the government shutdown might come today s announced deal is a temporary reprieve but not yet a permanent solution to the impasse it thus cannot be reassuring that the leaders in the executive branch seem to be people who have no conception of the household realities of anyone who is not a multimillionaire like much in the trump era the plight of workers struggling to cover health care mortgages and groceries juxtaposed with trump administration officials who own modigliani paintings and whose callousness is compounded by cluelessness is a grotesque illustration of the income inequality that plagues our nation across the aisle this week democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren proposed an ambitious wealth tax on those with more than 50 million in assets a policy that could raise trillions for robust population wide health insurance coverage for the hyper rarified class of americans who are unacquainted with grocery stores it would mean a check on unfettered accumulation and congress s most charismatic newcomer alexandria ocasio cortez has a policy guru dan riffle whose twitter display name is a bald salvo against income inequality every billionaire is a policy failure this may scandalize sean hannity but i d bet wilbur ross s 600 slippers it appeals to a broad segment of the population specifically the 59 percent of americans who endorse a 70 percent marginal tax rate on incomes above 10 million it is perhaps not surprising that a new and bolder stance on income inequality from the democratic party coincides with a widely detested presidential administration whose officials live cocooned in the worlds of their own substantial assets the charade of trump and his cronies attempting to project insight into the lives of those outside the comfortable aeries of the ultra wealthy is as empty as marie antoinette s pleasure dairy but their fantasies aren t even pretty or pleasing there s no warm light on healthy wealthy petticoated milkmaids and no versailles just a big echoing white house the president once reportedly called a dump full of workers furloughed or strong armed into volunteering without pay the president is trapped inside in an edifice constructed of his own hubris extracting pain from the common people who serve under him to service his own pride perhaps by the time he emerges he will find a world in which those who daily suffer the indignities of poverty won t be content to simply wait for a better world but may wish to shape it just as happened to marie antoinette

by tom luongo zerohedge com fri 01 25 2019 the u s backed a coup in venezuela that has failed and president trump was the architect of it this is a farce surrounding an intrigue contained within a tragedy what has happened in venezuela is tragic nicolas maduro is a comical figure straight out of central casting for a south american leader of a junta but it has been the u s s designs on venezuela s oil and gas reserves the largest proven in the world as of 2017 that is the real story behind this week s events for anyone still harboring doubts as to who trump truly is venezuela should end them trump s energy dominance policy is at the core of his foreign policy and he will do whatever it takes to secure that policy and deliver a long standing order to the u s and european oligarchy to gain control over venezuela energy dominance as alistair crooke succinctly put it last year at strategic culture the us were energy dominance to succeed simply would control the tap to the economic development or its lack thereof for rivals china and asia and the us could squeeze russia s revenues in this way too in short the us could put a tourniquet on china s and russia s economic development plans is this why jcpoa was revoked by president trump here then is the squaring of that circle more us power yet less empire trump s us aims for domination not through the globalists permanent infrastructure of the us defence umbrella but through the smart leveraging of the us dollar and financial clearing monopoly by ring fencing and holding tight us technology and by dominating the energy market which in turn represents the on off valve to economic growth for us rivals in this way trump can bring the troops home and yet america keeps its hegemony military conflict becomes a last resort most of trump s supporters refuse to admit this is the plan they still want to believe that national security advisor john bolton and secretary of state mike pompeo were thrust upon him by the nefarious deep state and that trump is a trapped hero in a cage yearning to breathe free and maga if we just support him a little more nonsense trump has been very clear about this policy for years we take over these places kill the bad people and pay for it all by stealing their natural resources in this case oil it is trump s 17th century view on trade writ large since this is a 17th century colonial mindset an independent venezuela even if it is run by an incompetent bus driver is something that cannot be allowed to stand anyone that refuses to trade that oil on u s controlled exchanges exchanges controlled by goldman sachs or in u s dollars is to be taken over and a puppet government installed c f iraq libya but only after your production is removed from the market so that we can sell ours this is geopolitics 101 folks nothing new under the sun does everyone not remember trump s cutting venezuela from the global monetary system through sanctions last year the socialism bogey the worst of the country s hyper inflation occurred after this sadly it was cheered on by libertarians and conservatives more interested in proving socialism is bad than seeing the bigger picture of how it was fomented by immoral u s policy under trump s guidance because no one f cks with the orange jesus man whoa maduro s attempts to rebuild venezuela s monetary system outside of the control of the u s s dominance of financial markets are a blueprint for resisting energy dominance whether maduro s petro cryptocurrency and sovereign bolivar succeed are irrelevant what s important is that he has gained the backing of both china and russia in support of the scheme they are all along with iran committed to an alternate path to trump s energy dominance they have to be because the u s will not stop locking down the world financial system around oil until stopped practically and trump has to continue on the path he s on if he believes in america s inherent greatness which he does and quash them with everything in his power so now he is taking on the weakest link venezuela a country softened up by chavez s idiocy and maduro s incompetence but it took the u s leaning on them through ruinous sanctions to destroy what was left and ensure the collapse of its oil industry so ours can thrive then we blame the venezuelan people for resisting our edicts and electing the wrong man this is the john bolton blueprint for regime change demonize the leader of a country that opposes our imperial rule cut them off from the rest of the world through sanctions and political military pressure and wait for the society to collapse then back a regime change by a u s groomed puppet in this case the nobody who is juan guaidó sell it all the entire time as a failure of the other guy in charge for chavez and maduro the spectre of socialism is all it takes especially now with the democrats and the media championing our own female che alexandria ocasio cortez as the bogeyfem if that fails and it looks like it has then threaten to invade on humanitarian grounds the only way this works with a u s population weary of two straight decades of war is for things to get so bad our intervention makes us look like the savior of a blighted people the good guy blueprint guess what this is the exact groundwork bolton is laying for iran squeeze them until they pop and then back a coup by the mujahadeen al khaq mek who like guaidó have absolutely zero support within iran and would be the exact antithesis of what the iranian people would want in other words shah 2 0 and are both some flavor of communist just like maduro but don t tell the magapedes this it ll make them cry this is why we refused to work with venezuela and sanctioned them instead maybe the reason maduro wouldn t work with us is because he knew what the ultimate plan was but the real tragedy here is that trump has now embraced interventionist foreign policy completely he s like arnold s character in james cameron s true lies when his impossibly how wife finds out who he truly is she asks him have you ever killed anyone and he quips like a little boy yeah but they were all bad this is how he s selling this betrayal of his base and maga because venezuela today iran tomorrow the rest here

russia china india iran the magic quadrant that is changing the world with the end of the unipolar moment which saw washington dominate international relations the richest and most powerful eurasian countries are beginning to organize themselves into alliance structures and agreements that aim to facilitate trade development and cooperation at the height of the us unipolar moment bill clinton was leading a country in full economic recovery and the strategists at the pentagon were drawing up plans to shape the world in their own image and likeness the undeclared goal was regime change in all countries with unapproved political systems which would allow for the proliferation of us made democracy to the four corners of the earth clearly eurasian countries like russia india china and iran were on top of the to do list as were countries in the middle east and north africa the bombing and destruction of yugoslavia was the final step in the assault on the russian federation following the dissolution of the warsaw pact yeltsin represented the means by which western high finance decided to suck all russia s wealth privatizing companies and plundering strategic resources china on the other hand saw a rebirth as a result of american and european manufacturing companies relocating to the country to take advantage of the cheap labor it offered india historically close to the ussr and iran historically averse to washington were struggling to find a new balance in a world dominated by washington tehran was clearly in an open conflict with the united states because of the 1979 islamic revolution that liberated the country from western submission under the shah mohammad reza pahlavi india understood the new reality laying the foundations for a close cooperation with washington previously the use of jihadism in afghanistan through the coordination between pakistan saudi arabia and the united states had severely undermined relations between india and the united states remembering that new delhi was an important ally of moscow during the cold war following the fall of the berlin wall and the commencement of the unipolar era india russia china and iran started down their paths of historical rebirth though starting from very different positions and following different paths india understood that washington had immense economic and military power at its disposal despite the early embraces between clinton and indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee relations between new delhi and washington reached unexpected heights during the bush era a series of factors helped to weld the bond there was firstly the reality of india s great economic growth secondly india offered the opportunity of counterbalancing and containing china a classic geopolitical scenario during this delicate unipolar period there were two highly significant events for russia and china that represented the beginning of the end for washington s plans to dominate the planet first of all putin became president of the russian federation on december 31 1999 secondly beijing was accepted into the world trade organization wto today s chinese economic power took flight thanks to the western industrial companies relocating their manufacturing to china so as to see their dividends triplicate and costs more than halve it was a winning model for the capitalist and a loser for the western factory worker as we would come to see 20 years later the strategic thinking of the newly elected putin was geopolitically visionary and had at its base a complete revamp of russia s military doctrine china and russia both initially sought to follow the indian path of cooperation and development with washington moscow attempted a frank dialogue with washington and nato but the decision by the us in 2002 to withdraw from the anti ballistic missile treaty abm treaty marked the beginning of the end of the western dream of integrating the russian federation into nato for beijing the path was more downhill thanks to a vicious circle whereby the west relocated to china to increase profits which were then invested into the us stock market multiplying the gains several times it seemed like the americans were onto something until 20 years later the entire middle and working classes found themselves being reduced to penury in this period following september 11 2001 washington s focus shifted rapidly away from confronting rival powers to the so called fight against terrorism it was an expedient way of occupying tactically important countries in strategically important regions of the planet in eurasia us forces settled in afghanistan on the pretext of fighting al qaeda and the taliban in the middle east they occupy iraq for the second time and have made it an operational base from which to destabilize the rest of the region in the decades since while india and china mainly pursued peaceful growth as a means of economically empowering the asian region russia and iran early understood that washington s attention would eventually fall on them moscow was still considered the deadly enemy by the neoconservative cold war warriors while the islamic revolution of 1979 was neither forgotten nor forgiven in the decade following 9 11 the foundations for the creation of a multipolar order were laid generating in the process the huge transitional chaos we are currently experiencing india and china continued on their path to becoming economic giants even as there is a latent but constant rivalry while iran and russia continued on their path of military rejuvenation in order to ensure a deterrent sufficient to discourage any attacks by israel or the us respectively the breaking point for this delicate geopolitical balance came in the form of the arab spring of 2011 while india and china continued their economic growth and russia and iran grew to become regional powers that were difficult to push around the us continued its unipolar rampage bombing somalia afghanistan and iraq after having earlier bombed yugoslavia as the pentagon devising light footprint operations in the middle east with the help of the saudis israelis brits and french who aided and armed local jihadis to wreak havoc first tunisia then egypt and finally libya more dead more bombs more chaos the warning signs were apparent to all regional powers from china and russia to india and iran even if the synergies were still not in place it was clear to everyone what had to be done us destabilization around the world had to be contained with particular focus on eurasia the middle east and north africa slowly and not without problems these four countries began a military economic political and diplomatic cooperation that almost a decade later allowed for the ending of the us unipolar moment and the creation of a multipolar reality with different centers of power the first confirmation of this new phase in international relations favoured by historical ties was the increasingly multifaceted cooperation between india and russia another factor was china and russia being drawn to the middle east and north africa as a result of the obama administration s actions in the middle east with its arab springs bombing of libya and destabilization of syria they feared that prolonged chaos in the region would eventually have a negative effect on their own economies and social stability the final straw was the coup d état in ukraine as well as the escalation of provocations in the south china sea following the launch by the us of its so called pivot to asia russia and china were thus forced into a situation neither had thought impossible for the previous 40 years the joining of hands to change the world order by removing washington from its superpower dais initially there were amazing economic agreements that left the western planners stumped then came the military synergies and finally the diplomatic ones expressed by coordinated voting in the united nations security council from 2014 onwards russia and china signed important agreements that laid the foundations for a long running eurasian duopoly obama s legacy did not stop with more than 100 000 jihadists unleashed on the country financed by us and her allies this led moscow to intervene in syria to protect its borders and obviate the jihadists eventual advance on the caucasus historically russia s soft underbelly this move was hailed by the pentagon as a new vietnam for russia but these calculations were completely wrong and moscow in addition to saving syria and frustrating the plans of washington and her confederates greatly strengthened its relationship with iran not always a simple relationship especially during the soviet period elevating it to the high level of regional cooperation obama s legacy was to inadvertently create a strategic triangle involving iran china and russia and their development of high level projects and programs for the region and beyond it represents a disaster for us foreign policy as well as the unquestionable end of the unipolar dream jumping forward a few years we find trump in the driving seat of the united states repeating just one mantra america first from the indian point of view this has further aggravated the relations between the two countries with sanctions and duties placed on india for what was a western decision in the first place to shift manufacturing to low wage india in order to further fatten the paychecks of the ceos of euro american companies modi s india is forced to significantly increase its ties to iran to guarantee its strategic autonomy in terms of energy supply without forgetting the geographic proximity of the two countries in this context russia and iran s victory against terrorism in the middle east pacifies the region and stabilizes syria egypt iraq and libya thereby allowing for the development of such new projects as the mega silk road 2 0 investment on which beijing places considerable importance we could go on in this vein detailing how even china and india have overcome their historical mistrust well aware that divide and rule only benefits those who are on the other side of the ocean certainly not two countries experiencing great economic growth with a common border spanning thousands of miles the meetings between modi and xi jinping as well as those between putin and xi jinping or putin with modi show how the intention of these three leaders is to ensure a peaceful and prosperous future for their citizens and this cannot be separated from a stronger union together with an abandonment of disputes and differences the synergies in recent years have shifted from the military and diplomatic arenas to the economic one especially thanks to donald trump and his aggressive policy of wielding the dollar like a club with which to strike political opponents one last step that these countries need to take is that of de dollarization which plays an important role in how the the us is able to exercise economic influence even if the us dollar were to remain central for several years the process of de dollarization is irreversible right now iran plays a vital role in how countries like india russia and china are able to respond asymmetrically to the us russia uses military power in syria china seeks economic integration in the silk road 2 0 and india bypasses the dollar by selling oil in exchange for goods or other currency india china and russia use the middle east as a stepping stone to advance energy economic and military integration pushing out the plans of the neocons in the region thereby indirectly sending a signal to israel and saudi arabia on the other hand conflicts in syria iraq and afghanistan are occasions for peacemaking advancing the integration of dozens of countries by incorporating them into a major project that includes eurasia the middle east and north africa instead of the us and her proxy states soon there will be a breaking point not so much militarily as the nuclear mad doctrine is still valid but rather economically of course the spark will come from changing the denomination in which oil is sold namely the us dollar this process will still take time but it is an indispensable condition for iran becoming a regional hegemon china is increasingly clashing with washington russia is increasingly influential in opec and india may finally decide to embrace the eurasian revolution by forming an impenetrable strategic square against washington which will shift the balance of global power to the east after more than 500 years of domination by the west the strategic culture foundation

alfonse d amato posted friday january 25 2019 11 32 am gov andrew cuomo s recent state of the state address was an impressive presentation of his accomplishments over the past eight years and his vision for the next four he showed a command of detail and a masterful understanding of government that is a product of his distinguished years of public service i ve known cuomo since i supported his appointment as secretary of housing and urban development in washington when i served as a senator and have watched him grow in stature and effectiveness through his years in albany i believe that what has set him apart is his willingness to act clearly and decisively and without political favoritism during his first two terms as governor that meant working with a republican led state senate that often represented a point of view different from his own today that dynamic has dramatically shifted and cuomo now leads what has essentially become a one party government that may seem like an advantage but it can make governing more challenging because much of what he has accomplished for new york has involved restraining rather than expanding the scope and cost of government that s been key to strengthening new york s economic progress and its competitive viability in his address cuomo cited the strength of our state s economy he pointed out that new york s 8 2 million jobs are a historic high and its 3 9 percent unemployment a historic low while the growing u s economy has contributed to this well being the governor s careful stewardship of new york has made a substantial contribution too his 2 percent property tax cap has helped alleviate crushing property taxes that have the greatest impact on middle class working people and retirees his administration s careful management of the state s expensive medicaid program has brought down excessive costs his budgets aid to local schools has been generous without breaking new york s fiscal back and in the process he has found significant dollars for upstate revitalization community development and badly needed infrastructure projects from replacing the tappan zee bridge to rebuilding the aging laguardia and kennedy airports all of this has been made possible by new york s strong economy which has generated significant tax revenue it is the goose that lays golden eggs cuomo proudly pointed to the state s fiscal soundness and high credit rating that s something that must be carefully protected during these good times but if the legislature orders the spending floodgates opened with irresponsible demands for unsustainable increases in the budget these gains could evaporate in short order right now the state is on a trajectory for continued economic growth amazon s recent decision to build a headquarters in long island city will be a major financial boost to both the private and public sectors thousands of new workers will earn top salaries and pay big taxes and if the financial markets continue to perform well the state will benefit from large tax windfalls there as well but if the more radical voices in the state legislature clamor for inordinately costly items like single payer health insurance and other big ticket expenditures new york s good times could grind to a halt especially if our already high income taxes are hiked further to help foot the bill people and businesses can and do vote with their feet and other states are more than ready to siphon them away from new york what we ll need over the next few years is a carefully managed set of priorities cuomo is correct that at the top of that list is the rebuilding of the metropolitan transportation authority s infrastructure and his congestion pricing proposal to help fund this needed spending is worth serious consideration in addition he and the legislature should consider a modest increase in the state s gasoline tax with the revenue dedicated to infrastructure projects across the state in washington we raised gas taxes in the 1980s and 1990s the sky didn t fall and roads bridges and mass transit all benefited over the next decade new york is poised for continued fast paced growth and progress our state has a highly educated work force well suited to the 21st century economy we re blessed with many advantages that other states can t easily match our governor has been an able steward of the empire state s legacy the state of the state is sound let s keep it that way al d amato a former u s senator from new york is the founder of park strategies llc a public policy and business development firm comments about this column adamato liherald com
somalia afghanistan and iraq yugoslavia tunisia egypt libya syria ukraine independent freelance writer specialized in international affairs conflicts politics and strategies with the end of the unipolar moment which saw washington dominate international relations the richest and most powerful eurasian countries are beginning to organize themselves into alliance structures and agreements that aim to facilitate trade development and cooperation at the height of the us unipolar moment bill clinton was leading a country in full economic recovery and the strategists at the pentagon were drawing up plans to shape the world in their own image and likeness which would allow for the proliferation of us made democracy to the four corners of the earth the bombing and destruction of yugoslavia was the final step in the assault on the russian federation following the dissolution of the warsaw pact yeltsin represented the means by which western high finance decided to suck all russia s wealth privatizing companies and plundering strategic resources china on the other hand saw a rebirth as a result of american and european manufacturing companies relocating to the country to take advantage of the cheap labor it offered india historically close to the ussr and iran historically averse to washington were struggling to find a new balance in a world dominated by washington tehran was clearly in an open conflict with the united states because of the 1979 islamic revolution that liberated the country from western submission under the shah mohammad reza pahlavi india understood the new reality laying the foundations for a close cooperation with washington previously the use of jihadism in afghanistan through the coordination between pakistan saudi arabia and the united states had severely undermined relations between india and the united states remembering that new delhi was an important ally of moscow during the cold war following the fall of the berlin wall and the commencement of the unipolar era india russia china and iran started down their paths of historical rebirth though starting from very different positions and following different paths india understood that washington had immense economic and military power at its disposal despite the early embraces between clinton and indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee relations between new delhi and washington reached unexpected heights during the bush era a series of factors helped to weld the bond there was firstly the reality of india s great economic growth secondly india offered the opportunity of counterbalancing and containing china a classic geopolitical scenario during this delicate unipolar period there were two highly significant events for russia and china that represented the beginning of the end for washington s plans to dominate the planet first of all today s chinese economic power took flight thanks to the western industrial companies relocating their manufacturing to china so as to see their dividends triplicate and costs more than halve it was a winning model for the capitalist and a loser for the western factory worker as we would come to see 20 years later the strategic thinking of the newly elected putin was geopolitically visionary and had at its base a complete revamp of russia s military doctrine moscow attempted a frank dialogue with washington and nato but the decision by the us in 2002 to withdraw from the anti ballistic missile treaty abm treaty marked the beginning of the end of the western dream of integrating the russian federation into nato for beijing the path was more downhill thanks to a vicious circle whereby the west relocated to china to increase profits which were then invested into the us stock market multiplying the gains several times it seemed like the americans were onto something until 20 years later the entire middle and working classes found themselves being reduced to penury in this period following september 11 2001 washington s focus shifted rapidly away from confronting rival powers toin eurasia us forces settled in afghanistan on the pretext of fighting al qaeda and the taliban in the middle east they occupy iraq for the second time and have made it an operational base from which to destabilize the rest of the region in the decades since while india and china mainly pursued peaceful growth as a means of economically empowering the asian region russia and iran early understood that washington s attention would eventually fall on them moscow was still considered the deadly enemy by the neoconservative cold war warriors while the islamic revolution of 1979 was neither forgotten nor forgiven in the decade following 9 11 the foundations for the creation of a multipolar order were laid generating in the process the huge transitional chaos we are currently experiencing the breaking point for this delicate geopolitical balance came in the form of the arab spring of 2011 while india and china continued their economic growth and russia and iran grew to become regional powers that were difficult to push around the warning signs were apparent to all regional powers from china and russia to india and iran even if the synergies were still not in place it was clear to everyone what had to be done us destabilization around the world had to be contained with particular focus on eurasia the middle east and north africa slowly and not without problems these four countries began a military economic political and diplomatic cooperation that almost a decade later allowed for the ending of the us unipolar moment and the creation of a multipolar reality with different centers of power the first confirmation of this new phase in international relations favoured by historical ties was the increasingly multifaceted cooperation between india and russia another factor was china and russia being drawn to the middle east and north africa as a result of the obama administration s actions in the middle east with its arab springs bombing of libya andthey feared that prolonged chaos in the region would eventually have a negative effect on their own economies and social stability following the launch by the us of its so called pivot to asia russia and china were thus forced into a situation neither had thought impossible for the previous 40 years the joining of hands to change the world order by removing washington from its superpower dais initially there were amazing economic agreements that left the western planners stumped then came the military synergies and finally the diplomatic ones expressed by coordinated voting in the united nations security council obama s legacy did not stop to protect its borders and obviate the jihadists eventual advance on the caucasus historically russia s soft underbelly this move was hailed by the pentagon as a new vietnam for russia but these calculations were completely wrong and moscow not always a simple relationship especially during the soviet period elevating it to the high level of regional cooperation obama s legacy was to inadvertently create a strategic triangle involving iran china and russia and their development of high level projects and programs for the region and beyond it represents a disaster for us foreign policy as well as the unquestionable end of the unipolar dream jumping forward a few years we find trump in the driving seat of the united states repeating just one mantra america first from the indian point of view this has further aggravated the relations between the two countries with sanctions and duties placed on india for what was a western decision in the first place to shift manufacturing to low wage india in order to further fatten the paychecks of the ceos of euro american companies modi s india is forced to significantly increase its ties to iran to guarantee its strategic autonomy in terms of energy supply without forgetting the geographic proximity of the two countries in this context we could go on in this vein detailing how even china and india have overcome their historical mistrust well aware that certainly not two countries experiencing great economic growth with a common border spanning thousands of miles the meetings between modi and xi jinping as well as those between putin and xi jinping or putin with modi show how the intention of these three leaders is to ensure a peaceful and prosperous future for their citizens and this cannot be separated from a stronger union together with an abandonment of disputes and differences the synergies in recent years have especially thanks to donald trump and his aggressive policy of wielding the dollar like a club with which to strike political opponents one last step that these countries need to take is that of de dollarization which plays an important role in how the the us is able to exercise economic influence even if the us dollar were to remain central for several years

the latest move by saudi arabia will do little to curb hezbollah s actions in syria saudi arabia s decision to ban its citizens from traveling to lebanon only raises more questions about the kingdom s foreign policy in the middle east the travel ban comes on the heels of previous decisions to cut off aid to beirut and withdraw deposits with the lebanese central bank riyadh s move was followed by similar actions from other members of the gulf cooperation council gcc including bahrain qatar kuwait and the united arab emirates these actions come at a bad time for the battered levantine nation with its population swelled by nearly 25 by syrian refugees the concomitant syrian civil war on its eastern border raging into its sixth year and its presidential selection saga still undecided lebanon cannot afford to lose either the gcc funds on which it has depended for so long nor the many gulf travelers who come to enjoy and generously spend their vacation cash in the famous mediterranean resort nation saudi arabia s decision was ostensibly made because of lebanon based hezbollah s major role in the syrian crisis in which riyadh and doha are backing forces opposing the assad regime s forces which are heavily supported by hezbollah fighters weapons and intelligence but one must ask how depriving beirut of the gcc s vital support will hurt hezbollah or in any way undermine its efforts in syria the lebanese government has no ability to diminish much less eliminate hezbollah s role in lebanese politics or policy or the presence of hezbollah in southern lebanon for the time being hezbollah is an established if undesirable feature of lebanon s contorted and ill constructed political system one might also conclude that beirut may end up becoming more dependent on saudi arabia s principal arch rival for power and influence in the middle east iran the latter already heavily entrenched as well in the syria fighting in support of president bashar al assad will have no interest in seeing yet another important base for shia influence in the region made more unstable but then neither will jordan egypt or israel nor can the kingdom of saudi arabia a longtime supporter of the sunni factions in lebanon see instability there as in its interest the funding decisions may also have to do with some unfamiliar belt tightening that is taking place in saudi arabia oil prices still hang around the 30 dollar mark after an 18 month decline from 100 plus per barrel and forecasts suggest that it may be until 2017 before oil exporters like saudi arabia and the other gcc states see any rebound in those prices according to media reports oil revenue is the single biggest source of government income in saudi arabia at an estimated 90 the price plummet left a budget deficit of 98 billion in 2015 or about 15 of gross domestic product the international monetary fund is projecting another 87 billion deficit this year further eroding the kingdom s once enormous reserves so reducing aid a familiar budget cutting measure among western nations might seem like a logical move for riyadh however punishing an otherwise saudi friendly lebanon which also enjoys the support of the us and france among others would appear to be an unwise tactical move cutting off one s nose to spite its face while perhaps throwing a short term wrench in iran s policy calculations the move most certainly will not affect its support for hezbollah or syria nor upset hezbollah s role in syria but it will further weaken lebanon as it battles to keep afloat on so many fronts security economics and domestic politics the decisions regarding lebanon are attributed to king salman s young son and deputy crown prince mohammed bin salman while his intentions to diversify the kingdom s oil dependent economy privatize state enterprises and reduce subsidies are to be lauded this decision which most assuredly impacts foreign and security policy appears unwise if not erratic saudi arabia and the us did saudi arabia s policymaking leadership coordinate this among themselves or with important allies beyond the gcc such as the us the status of relations with the latter is well known as saudi authorities have expressed both privately and even publicly their dissatisfaction with washington s policy decisions as they apply to the middle east from lackluster support for the moderate opposition in syria to last year s p5 1 agreement to limit iran s nuclear development program that riyadh did not consult with washington on its decision over lebanon would seem all but apparent had it done so the us might have advised other ways to address the hezbollah question in lebanon without harming the country saudi arabia s european allies doubtlessly would have counseled the same when considered in light of other decisions emanating from the kingdom since salman s assumption of the throne in january 2015 for example the destructive civil war in yemen which shows little evidence of ending fruitless flailing over what to do in syria and pointless antagonizing of a resurgent iran one is left to wonder how much more damage to riyadh s interests await more than anything however this latest decision may illustrate the erratic nature of decision making in a riyadh untethered to what had been heretofore a core strategic relationship with washington saudi arabia may be correct in that the us has showed some unsophisticated policymaking in the middle east perhaps as a result of having failed to listen closely enough to its key allies like riyadh but the two countries still share a vital core interest gulf and regional security and stability this latest decision would appear to act in contravention to both the views expressed in this article are the

magnitude of the shutdown might have major effects on consumers confidence if the government can t work together in times where there are no real crises imagine what would happen in an environment
