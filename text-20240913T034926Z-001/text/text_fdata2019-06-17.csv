preface ahmed is one of the best writers on the energy crisis and other biophysical calamities he s written about why many states are failing now in part due to peak oil but also drought and other biophysical factors in his book failing states collapsing systems biophysical triggers of political violence below is his take on venezula where peak oil production occurred in 1997 what happened there may be how events unfold in the united states as well so it is worth reading how collapsing states like venezuela fail if you re curious about your own future and mexico may be the next to

broken legacy of chavez s ideological experiment in socialism under the mounting insidious influence of putin for others it s all about the ongoing counter democratic meddling of the united states which has for years wanted to bring venezuela with its huge oil reserves back into the orbit of american power and is now interfering again to undermine a democratically elected leader in latin america neither side truly understands the real driving force behind the collapse of venezuela we have moved into the twilight of the age of oil so how does a country like venezuela with the largest reserves of crude oil in the world end up incapable of developing them while various elements of socialism corruption and neoliberal capitalism are all implicated in various ways what no one s talking about especially the global oil industry is that over the last decade we ve shifted into a new era the world has moved from largely extracting cheap easy crude to becoming increasingly dependent on unconventional forms of oil and gas that are much more difficult and expensive to produce oil isn t running out in fact it s everywhere we ve more than enough to fry the planet but as the easy cheap stuff has plateaued production costs have soared and as a consequence the most expensive oil to produce has become increasingly unprofitable in a country like venezuela emerging from a history of us interference plagued by internal economic mismanagement combined with external intensifying pressure from us sanctions this decline in profitability has became fatal since hugo chavez s election in 1999 the us has continued to explore numerous ways to interfere in and undermine his socialist government this is consistent with the track record of us overt and covert interventionism across latin america which has sought to overthrow democratically elected governments which undermine us interests in the region supported right wing autocratic regimes and funded trained and armed far right death squads complicit in wantonly massacring hundreds of thousands of people for all the triumphant moralizing in parts of the western media about the failures of venezuela s socialist experiment there has been little reflection on the role of this horrific counter democratic us foreign policy in paving the way for a populist hunger for nationalist and independent alternatives to us backed cronyism before chavez venezuela used to be a dream us ally model free market economy and a major oil producer with the largest reserves of crude oil in the world the conventional narrative is that its current implosion can only be due to colossal mismanagement of its domestic resources described back in 1990 by the new york times as one of latin america s oldest and most stable democracies the newspaper of record predicted that thanks to the geopolitical volatility of the middle east venezuela is poised to play a newly prominent role in the united states energy scene well into the 1990 s at the time venezuelan oil production was helping to offset the shortage caused by the embargo of oil from iraq and kuwait amidst higher oil prices triggered by the simmering conflict but the nyt had camouflaged a deepening economic crisis as noted by leading expert on latin america javier corrales in revista harvard review of latin america venezuela had never recovered from currency and debt crises it had experienced in the 1980s economic chaos continued well into the 1990s just as the times had celebrated the market economy s friendship with the us explained corrales inflation remained indomitable and among the highest in the region economic growth continued to be volatile and oil dependent growth per capita stagnated unemployment rates surged and public sector deficits endured despite continuous spending cutbacks prior to the ascension of chavez the entrenched party political system so applauded by the us and courted by international institutions like the imf was essentially crumbling according to a recent report by data information resources to the venezuelan american chamber of commerce in the last 25 years the share of household income spent on food has shot up to 72 from 28 lamented the new york times in 1996 the middle class has shrunk by a third an estimated 53 percent of jobs are now classified as informal in the underground economy as compared with 33 in the late 1970 s the nyt piece cynically put all the blame for the deepening crisis on government largesse and interventionism in the economy but even here within the subtext the paper acknowledged a historical backdrop of consistent imf backed austerity measures according to the nyt even the ostensibly anti austerity president rafael caldera who had promised more state financed populism as an antidote to years of imf wrought austerity ended up negotiating for a 3 billion loan from the imf along with a second loan of undisclosed size to ease the social impact of any hardships imposed by an imf agreement so it is convenient that today s loud and self righteous moral denunciations of maduro ignore the instrumental role played by us efforts to impose market fundamentalism in wreaking economic and social havoc across venezuelan society of course outside the fanatical echo chambers of the trump white house and the likes of the new york times the devastating impact of us backed world bank and imf austerity measures is well documented among serious economists in a paper for the london school of economics development economist professor jonathan dijohn of the un research institute for social development found that us backed economic liberalization not only failed to revive private investment and economic growth but also contributed to a worsening of the factorial distribution of income which contributed to growing polarisation of politics neoliberal reforms further compounded already existing centralized nepotistic political structures vulnerable to corruption far from strengthening the state they led to a collapse in the state s regulative power analysts who hark back to a venezuelan free market golden age ignore the fact that far from reducing corruption financial deregulation large scale privatizations and private monopolies create large rents and thus rent seeking corruption opportunities instead of leading to meaningful economic reforms neoliberalisation stymied genuine reform and entrenched elite power and this is precisely how the west helped create the chavez it loves to hate in the words of corrales in the harvard review economic collapse and party system collapse are intimately related venezuela s repeated failure to reform its economy made existing politicians increasingly unpopular who in turn responded by privileging populist policies over real reforms the result was a vicious cycle of economic and political party decay ultimately paving the way for the rise of chavez dead oil while it is now fashionable to blame the collapse of the venezuelan oil industry solely on chavez s socialism caldera s privatization of the oil sector was unable to forestall the decline in oil production which peaked in 1997 at around 3 5 million barrels a day by 1999 chavez s first actual year in office production had already dropped dramatically by around 30 percent a deeper look reveals that the causes of venezuela s oil problems are slightly more complicated than the chávez killed it meme since peaking around 1997 venezuelan oil production has declined over the last two decades but in recent years has experienced a precipitous fall there can be little doubt that serious mismanagement in the oil industry has played a role in this decline however there is a fundamental driver other than mismanagement which the press has consistently ignored in reporting on venezuala s current crisis the increasingly fraught economics of oil the vast bulk of venezuela s oil is not conventional crude but unconventional heavy oil a highly viscous liquid that requires unconventional techniques to extract and flow often with heat from steam and or mixing it with lighter forms of crude in the refining process heavy oil thus has a higher cost of extraction than normal crude and a lower market price due to the refining difficulties in theory heavy oil can be produced at below break even prices to a profit but greater investment is still needed to get to that point the higher costs of extraction and refining have played a key role in making venezuela s oil production efforts increasingly unprofitable and unsustainable when oil prices were at their height between 2005 and 2008 venezuela was able to weather the inefficiencies and mismanagement in its oil industry due to much higher profits thanks to prices between 100 and 150 a barrel global oil prices were spiking as global conventional crude oil production began to plateau causing an increasing shift to unconventional sources that global shift did not mean that oil was running out but that we were moving deeper into dependence on more difficult and expensive forms of unconventional oil and gas the shift can be best understood through the concept of energy return on investment eroi pioneered principally by the state university of new york environmental scientist professor charles hall a ratio which measures how much energy is used to extract a particular quantity of energy from any resource hall has shown that as we are consuming ever larger quantities of energy we are using more and more energy to do so leaving less surplus energy at the end to underpin social and economic activity this creates a counter intuitive dynamic even as production soars the quality of the energy we are producing declines its costs are higher industry profits are squeezed and the surplus available to sustain continued economic growth dwindles as the surplus energy available to sustain economic growth is squeezed in real terms the biophysical capacity of the economy to continue buying the very oil being produced reduces economic recession partly induced by the previous era of oil price spikes interacts with the lack of affordability of oil leading the market price to collapse that in turn renders the most expensive unconventional oil and gas projects potentially unprofitable unless they can find ways to cover their losses through external subsidies of some kind such as government grants or extended lines of credit and this is the key difference between venezuela and countries like the us and canada where extremely low eroi levels for production have been sustained largely through massive multi billion dollar loans fueling an energy boom that is likely to come to a catastrophic endwhen the debt turkey comes home to roost it s all a bit reminiscent of the dot com bubble of the late 1990s when internet companies were valued on the number of eyeballs they attracted not on the profits they were likely to make wrote bethany mclean recently once again in the new york times a us journalist well known for her work on the enron collapse as long as investors were willing to believe that profits were coming it all worked until it didn t a number of scientists have previously estimated the eroi of heavy oil production to amount to around 9 1 with room for variation up or down depending on how inputs are accounted for and calculated the unfashionable but probably more accurate approach would be downwards closer to 6 1 when both direct and indirect energy costs are considered compare this to the eroi of about 20 1 for conventional crude prior to 2000 which gives an indication of the challenge venezuela faced which unlike the us and canada had emerged into the chavez era from a history of neoliberal devastation and debt expansion that already made further investments or subsidies to venezuela s oil industry a difficult ask venezuela in that sense was ill prepared to adapt to the post 2014 oil price collapse compared to its wealthier western competitors in other forms of unconventional oil and gas to be sure then the collapse of venezuela s oil industry cannot be reduced to geological factors though there can be little doubt that those factors and their economic ramifications tend to be underplayed in conventional explanations above ground factors were clearly a major problem in terms of chronic inadequacy of investment and the resulting degradation of production infrastructure a balanced picture thus has to acknowledge both that venezuela s vast reserves are far more expensive and difficult to bring to market than standard conventional oil and that venezuala s very specific economic circumstances in the wake of decades of failed imf austerity put the country in an extremely weak position to keep its oil show on the road since 2008 oil production has declined by more than 350 000 barrels per day and more than 800 000 per day since its peak level in 1997 this has driven the collapse of net exports by over 1 1 million barrels per day since 1998 meanwhile to sustain refining of heavy oil venezuela has increasingly imported light oil to blend with heavy oil as well as for domestic consumption currently only extra heavy oil production in the orinoco oil belt has been able to increase while conventional oil production continues to rapidly decline despite significant proved conventional reserves these still require more expensive enhanced recovery techniques and infrastructure investments which are unavailable but profit margins from exports of extra heavy crude are much smaller due to the higher costs of blending upgrading and transportation and the heavy discounts in international refining markets in summary oil industry expert professor francisco monaldi at the center for energy and the environment at iesa in venezuela concludes oil production in venezuela is comprised of increasingly heavier oil and thus less profitable pdvsa s operated production is falling more rapidly and the production that generates cash flow is almost half of the total production these trends were problematic enough at peak oil prices but with prices falling they become much more acute the folly of endless growth unfortunately much like his predecessors chavez didn t appreciate the complexities let alone the biophysical economics of the oil industry rather he saw it simplistically through the short term lens of his own ideological socialist experiment from 1998 until his death in 2013 chavez s application of what he called socialism to the oil industry succeeded in reducing poverty from 55 to 34 percent helped 1 5 million adults become literate and delivered healthcare to 70 of the population with cuban doctors all this apparent progress was enabled by oil revenues but it was an unsustainable pipe dream instead of investing oil revenues back into production chavez spent them away on his social programs during the heyday of the oil price spikes with no thought to the industry he was drawing from and in the mistaken belief that prices would stay high by the time prices collapsed due to the global shift to difficult oil described earlier reducing venezuala s state revenues 96 percent of which come from oil chavez had no currency reserves to fall back on chavez had thus dramatically compounded the legacy of problems he had been left with he had mimicked the same mistake made by the west before 2008 pursuing a path of progress based on an unsustainable consumption of resources fueled by debt and bound to come crashing down so when he ran out of oil money he did what governments effectively did worldwide after the 2008 financial crash through quantitative easing he simply printed money the immediate impact was to drive up inflation he simultaneously fixed the exchange rate to dollars hiked up the minimum wage while forcing prices of staple goods like bread to stay low this of course turned businesses selling such staple goods or involved at every chain in their production into unprofitable enterprises which could no longer afford to pay their own employees due to hemorrhaging income levels meanwhile he slashed subsidies to farmers and other industries while imposing quotas on them to maintain production instead of producing the desired result many businesses ended up selling their goods on the black market in an attempt to make a profit as the economic crisis escalated and as oil production declined chavez pinned his hopes on the potential transformation that could be ushered in by massive state investment in a new type of economy based on nationalized self or cooperatively managed industries those investments too had little results dr asa cusack an expert on venezuela at the london school of economics points out that even though the number of cooperatives exploded in practice they were often as inefficient corrupt nepotistic and exploitative as the private sector that they were supposed to displace meanwhile with its currency reserves depleted the government has had to slash imports by over 65 percent since 2012 while simultaneously reducing social spending to even lower than it was under imf austerity reforms in the 1990s chavistan crisis driven socialism began with unsustainable social spending and has now switched to catastrophic levels of austerity that make neoliberalism look timid in this context the rise of the black market and organized crime exploited by both the government and the opposition became a way of life while the economy food production health care and basic infrastructure collapsed with frightening speed and ferocity climate wild cards amidst this perfect storm the wild card of climate impacts pushed venezuela over the edge accelerating an already dizzying spiral of crises in march 2018 on the back of hyperinflation and recession the government enforced electricity rationing across six western states in one state san cristobal residents reported 14 hour stretches without power after water levels in reservoirs used for hydroelectric plants were reduced due to drought a similar crisis had erupted two years earlier when water levels behind the guri dam which provides well over half the country s electricity hit record lows venezuela generates around 65 of its electricity from hydropower with a view to leave as much oil available as possible for export but this has made electricity supplies increasingly vulnerable to droughts induced by climate change impacts it is well known that the el nino southern oscillation the biggest fluctuation in the earth s climate system comprising a cycle of warm and cold sea surface temperatures in the tropical pacific ocean is increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change a new study on the impact of climate change in venezuela finds that between 1950 and 2004 12 out of 15 el nino events coincided with years in which mean annual flow of water in the caroni river basin affecting the guri reservoir and hydroelectric power was smaller than the historical mean from 2013 to 2016 an intensified el nino cycle meant that there was little rain in venezuela culminating in a crippling deficit in 2015 it was the worst drought in almost half a century in the country severely straining the country s aging and poorly managed energy grid resulting in rolling blackouts according to professor juan carlos sanchez a co recipient of the 2007 nobel peace prize for his work with intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc these trends will dramatically deteriorate under a business as usual scenario large areas of venezuelan states which are already water scarce such as falcon sucre lara and zulia including the north of the guajira peninsula will undergo desertification land degradation and decreased rainfall would devastate production of corn black beans and plantains across much of the country sanchez predicts that some regions of the country will receive 25 percent less water than today and that means even less electricity by mid century climate models indicate an overall 18 percent decrease in rainfall in the caroni river basin that leads to the guri dam unfortunately no venezuelan government has ever taken seriously its climate pledges preferring to escalate as much as possible its oil production and even intensifying the co2 intensive practice of gas flaring meanwhile escalating climate change is set to exacerbate venezuela s electricity blackouts infrastructure collapse and agricultural crisis economic war the crisis convergence unfolding in venezuela gives us a window into what can happen when a post oil future is foisted upon you as domestic energy supplies dwindle the state s capacity to function recedes in unprecedented ways opening the way for state failure as the state collapses new smaller centers of power emerge competing for control of diminishing resources in this context reports of food trafficking as a mechanism of economic war are real but they are not exclusive to either political side all sides have become incentivized to horde products and sell them on the black market as a direct result of the collapsing economy retrograde government price controls and wildly speculative prices venezuelan state owned media have pinpointed cases where private companies engaged in hoarding have close ties to the opposition in response the government has appropriated vast assets farmland bakeries other businesses but has failed to lift production on the other hand katiuska rodriguez a journalist investigating shortages at el nacional a pro opposition newspaper said that there is little clear evidence of hoarding being a result of an economic war by capitalist business elites against the government although real she explained hoarding is driven largely by commercial interests in survival and yet there is mounting evidence that the maduro government is complicit in not just hoarding but mass embezzlement of public funds sociologist chris carlson of the city university of new york graduate center points outthat a number of former senior chavista government officials have come on record to confirm how powerful elites within the government have exploited the crisis to extract huge profits for themselves a gang was created that was only interested in getting their hands on the oil revenue said hector navarro former chavista minister and socialist party leader similarly chavez s former finance minister jorge giordani estimated that some 300 billion was embezzled in this way and yet the real economic war is not really going on inside venezuela it has been conducted by the us against venezuela through a draconian sanctions regime which has exacerbated the arc of collapse francisco rodriguez chief economist at torino economics in new york points out that a major drop in venezuela s production numbers occurred precisely at the time at which the united states decided to impose financial sanctions on venezuela he argues that advocates of sanctions on venezuela claim that these target the maduro regime but do not affect the venezuelan people if the sanctions regime can be linked to the deterioration of the country s export capacity and to its consequent import and growth collapse then this claim is clearly wrong rodriguez marshals a range of evidence suggesting this might well be the case others with direct expertise have gone further former un special rapporteur to venezuela alfred de zayas who finished his term at the un in march 2018 criticised the us for engaging in economic warfare against venezuela on his fact finding mission to the country in late 2017 he confirmed the role of overdependence on oil poor governance and corruption but blamed the us eu and canadian sanctions for worsening the economic crisis and killing venezuelans us goals are fairly transparent in an interview with fox news that has been completely ignored by the press trump s national security advisor john bolton explained the focus of us attention we re looking at the oil assets that s the single most important income stream to the government of venezuela we re looking at what to do to that he continued we re in conversation with major american companies now i think we re trying to get to the same end result here it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies really invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela the coming oil crisis it is not entirely surprising that bolton is particularly eager at this time to extend us energy companies into venezuela north american exploration and production companies have seen their net debt balloon from 50 billion in 2005 to nearly 200 billion by 2015 industry doesn t make money it s on much shakier financial footing than most people realize said mclean who has just authored the book saudi america the truth about fracking and how it s changing the world indeed there is serious gulf between oil industry claims about opportunities for profit and what is actually happening in those companies when you look at oil companies presentations there s something that doesn t make sense because they show their investors these beautiful investor decks with gorgeous slides indicating that they will produce an 80 or 60 internal rate of return and then you go to the corporate level and you see that the company isn t making money and you wonder what happened between point a and point b in short cheap debt money has permitted the industry to grow but how long that can continue is an open question part of the point in writing my book was just to make people aware that as we trump at american energy independence let s think about some of the foundation of this and how insecure it actually is so that we re also planning for the future in different ways adds mclean indeed us shale oil and gas production is forecast to peak in around a decade or in as little as four years it s not just the us europe as a continent is already well into the post peak phase and russian oil ministry officials privately anticipate an imminent peak within the next few years as china india and other asian powers experience further demand growth everyone will be looking increasingly for a viable energy supply whether from the middle east or latin america but it won t come cheap or easy and it won t be healthy for the planet whatever their ultimate causes the horrifying collapse of venezuela heralds insights into a possible future for today s major oil producers including the united states the us is enjoying a revival in its oil industry but how long it will last and how sustainable it is are awkward questions that few pundits dare to ask except a brave few such as mclean this does not necessarily mean oil production will simply slowly grind to a halt as production limits are reached using current techniques new techniques might be brought into play to try to mine vast reserves of more difficult resources however whatever technological innovations emerge they are unlikely to be able to avert the trajectory of increasing costs of extraction refining and processing before getting fossil fuels to market and this means that the surplus energy available to devote to the delivery of public goods familiar to modern industrial consumerist societies will become smaller and smaller as we shift into a post carbon era we will have to adapt new economic thinking and restructure our ways of life from the ground up right now the venezuelan people find themselves locked into a vicious cycle of ill conceived human systems collapsing into violent in fighting in the face of the earth system crisis erupting beneath them it is not yet too late for the rest of the world to learn a lesson we can either be dragged into a world after oil kicking and screaming or we can roll up our sleeves and walk there in a manner of our own choosing it really is up to us venezuela should function as a warning sign as to what can happen when we bury our heads in the oil sands

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

the case for eu enlargement under an ineffective ecofin committee cameron milne follow 12 min read jun 8 2019 listen share photo by dimitris vetsikas the european union s obligation to integrate every european country into its network of economic and free travel agreements has come at the expense of accepting risky economies and their unsustainable government spending the eurozone and the adoption of the singular monetary policy known as the euro has bridged economic differences and eased the flow of international trade however a series of economic recessions in ireland spain portugal italy and greece have exposed the eurozone as a whole forcing many national leaders and economists to questions whether the monetary policy was premature by adopting one currency member states forfeited unilateral control over interest rates and their money supply restrictions on capital flows and the manipulation of exchange rates all methods that allow nation s to address their own economic recessions and recover quickly without a member state s ability to manage its own economy they are far less capable of recovering on their own terms and require assistance in greece s case they were forced to accept several bailout payments that cost the eu 240 billion euros 318 billion and only worsened their economy setting their recovery date back to 2060 the eu cannot afford another expensive bailout package for one of its member states regardless of whether the timing for the euro was appropriate it exists and countries will shoulder the long term costs for the short term benefits as the alternative the elimination of a singular monetary policy would be too costly for nations to recover from as nations like turkey macedonia montenegro serbia and albania await approval for admission into the eu there are several solutions that will reduce the possibility of another eurozone wide recession and diminish the likelihood of another bailout which may further divide the union while the eurozone designed agencies to monitor and enforce the fiscal compliance of eurozone countries this policy brief points out they are compromised and therefore ineffective if not unreliable at holding nations like greece accountable to pursuing benchmarks the solutions may be considered as front end and back end compromises for the electorate who understand the ineffectiveness of the agencies currently responsible for monitoring economic progress among its member states the european union cannot afford another greece greece s admission into the european economic community eec predecessor of eu in 1981 bolstered its place among the first wave of eurozone countries whose financial instability were put aside in efforts to launch the singular monetary policy in 2001 yet greece s debt crisis has been coagulating since 1981 when populist party leader andreas papandreou rose to leadership and began re orienting the government with programs that were largely protectionist and nationalist favoring liberal welfare policies early retirement pensions and import tariffs to encourage domestic production consumption the result of these initiatives were low productivity eroding competitiveness and rampant tax evasion over the next several decades when the eurozone materialized naivety over the potential of an integrated european economy and the symbolism of greece as the birthplace of western democracy skirted over issues such as accounting transparency that might have dissuaded economists and political leaders from accepting greece into the eurozone the reality of greece s economic crisis and subsequent eurozone debt crisis was that greece was not stable nor prepared to enter the eurozone yet greece wasn t the only country over its debt threshold in fact most economies in the european union were not meeting the eurozone s criteria the convergence report in 1996 reported that only denmark luxembourg and ireland were completely compliant out of the 15 eu member states if the european union had waited until all of its member states were ready by their standards the eurozone would not have launched the risk was believed to be necessary therefore the problem is in fact the ineffectiveness of the institutions designed to enforce eurozone convergence who is to blame if not greece as of 1999 the requirements for joining the european union are defined by the stability and growth pact sgp a set of rules designed to ensure that countries in the european union pursue sound public finances and coordinate their fiscal policies specifically the pact was focused on limiting budget deficits and debt relative to gross domestic product gdp their stability programmes or economic reports which assess the economic progress of each member state would inform the commission of council representatives of which member states were not meeting their requirements greece s economy was performing terribly the chart above reports on greece s debt to gdp ratio from 1995 to the second bailout package while the sgp enforces 60 or less greece was operating at over 120 the year they joined the eurozone the european commission understood greece would default unless action was taken but their recommendation went to the council for economic and financial affairs ecofin a committee established by the commission to oversee the operations of the sgp s responsibilities under normal circumstances the commission would receive a stability programme and see a country was operating over their debt threshold they would recommend to the committee that sanctions be placed on the country in effort to curb their debt but the agency is made up of representatives from each member state even those who aren t meeting the criteria if several countries failed to fulfill their economic benchmarks they can easily support each other during the qualified majority vote and block sanctions so in reality there are always several economies that are under performing for a variety of reasons not always poor government spending practices like greece and often those economies are france and germany who continue to weaken the pact so as to continue their excessive deficits such collusion efforts in the council prevented any countries from being fined and greece was able to understate their accounting practices without fear of sanctions when the greek financial audits of 2009 10 came it was too late the u s housing market had crashed triggering a domino effect on national economies around the world economist antonio martino wrote in criticism of the council s failure to act that the fiscal constraints introduced with the new currency must be criticized not because they are undesirable in my view they are a necessary component of a liberal order but because they are ineffective this is amply evidenced by the creative accounting gimmickry used by many countries to achieve the required deficit to gdp ratio of 3 percent ngo 2013 the institutions designed to ensure that fiscal discipline would be maintained and enforced were laggard considering the preventative arm and dissuasion arm of the sgp were unable to step in and effectively alter greece s path to the recession as result of political collusion from france and germany that sought to avoid corrective measures on their own economies alternative solutions must be explored the greece bailouts may have stabilized the economy and the larger eurozone community but at the expense of political upheaval impoverishment and increased euroscepticism another economic crisis may force the european union to fracture those who are willing to bear another bailout and those who may use a recession as an opportunity to further divide and resist european integration the european union needs to take immediate action over the failure of the ecofin committee front end zero tolerance policy for eurozone admissions the first recommendation is perhaps the easiest and most obvious solution given the unreliability of an agency that s comprised of representatives of the very nations that would be fined for economic divergence the commission would be smart to raise the barriers to entry in order to avoid the conflicts of interest that arise from having the authority of placing sanctions rest with the council specifically the commission should roll out a zero tolerance policy for prospective enlargement countries whose intolerance will extend across the required economic benchmarks for entry to the eurozone where an exception was necessary in 1999 to ensure the eurozone began the european union is now in a comfortable position to turn away countries who cannot prove their stability the graph below shows the most recently published statistics on government deficit relative to gdp from the european union s key figures on enlargement countries in 2017 as montenegro and serbia are considered the two most advanced candidates in the enlargement acceptance process the graph above would support montenegro s admission but not serbia in fact montenegro has a government surplus of nearly 8 suggesting their economy s stability over the eu as a whole even if small serbia under a zero tolerance policy should not be given the benefit of the doubt much less accepted as their deficit in 2015 sat above the threshold at 3 8 this has been ignored in the past as the eu sought to award newer democracies with admission into the club with hope that the sgp could enforce convergence but that s not the case as we know now if enlargement prospects do not meet the requirements for eurozone admission a clear timetable for legislation and implementation including structural benchmarks quantitative benchmarks and economic performance metrics may be offered the european union needs to push economies not only to pledge convergence but to prove early signs of convergence before opening an already vulnerable international economy to another developing nation this is also in the best interest of the enlargement prospects as they reserve the right to affect their own interest rates and control labor policies during economic down cycles given the ineffectiveness of the agencies charged with overseeing the convergence of the eurozone s economies the commission should look to raise the barrier of entry so as to mitigate as much risk as possible back end equalization payments the eu should also adopt eurozone wide equalization payments also referred to as transfer payments a redistribution of money from wealthier member states to poorer countries because europe s economies and government spending are varied and different regions are deprived of certain factors that enable economic growth in one sector or another equalization payments would reduce those fiscal disparities among countries since canadian economist robert mundell proposed his optimum currency zone oca several countries have adopted forms of redistribution in order to reduce a nation wide recession canada introduced equalization payments in 1957 and they continue to operate today in 2018 19 the department of finance canada reported that six provinces will receive 18 9 billion from the federal government the united states has adopted a form of equalization payments through welfare programs like medicaid which have played a role in stabilizing poorer regions like west virginia even non political applications like major league baseball operates on revenue sharing to support lower market teams a study in the international journal of financial studies reported the significant utility gains at little cost of the league for the revenue sharing system that had been implemented in a roll out program in 1996 incentives towards equalization payments are thwarted by reluctance of wealthier member states to bail out countries that are new to free market practices one study that looked at preferences for international redistribution sampled 5000 german voters and found that citizens were less inclined to support welfare across borders than within germany motivated by international conservatism among europeans and reluctance to identify as european over their respective national citizenry european segregationists often cite the fact that there are 24 languages across the 28 member states that make up the union in an article in the journal of economics professor kevin o rourke reminds that more than 40 of u s residents were born outside the state in which they live whereas only 14 of europeans were born in a different country than the one in which they live language remains an obstacle that s unlikely to change in the near future for the european union equalization payments can provide an insurance to those cultural barriers by stabilizing vulnerable regions granting more fiscal federalism to the european central bank ecb will also grease the wheels of european integration a goal shared by many national leaders politicians in wealthier countries like germany will have to bear the criticism of their electorate on currency risk sharing and welfare payments to weaker economies if they are going to protect the larger eurozone from another bailout a bailout which may weaken support for the eu altogether and bring more disaster in the form of mass unemployment high suicide rates and an exodus of academics and talented workers equalization payments offset the risk of recessions and are far smaller than the sum of bailout funds making them not only a viable option for stabilizing cross country differences but necessary back end two speed euro the eu should also consider the adoption of a two tier currency or what s been called a two speed euro the system has been proposed by political scientist and legal expert fritz w scharpf whose work is based on the structural differences between the northern hard currency countries which have export oriented economies and the southern soft currency states which are dependent on domestic demand in response to ineffective austerity measures placed on governments whose poor spending caused their debt crises a two tier system would embrace differences scharpf argues the preconditions are already in place as the existing currency union would need to be combined with the european rate exchange mechanism erm ii it would result in a adjustable system that would offer southern states the protection offered by a monetary association against fluctuation and possible currency market attacks without the need to meet the severe currency union conditions states would have to agree on a euro rate exchange which would be based on individual member state economic conditions the ecb would be equipped to deal with any initial imbalances or possible currency market attacks furthermore setting up a european currency fund would address liquidity bottlenecks in terms of the membership states would chose to be part of the tier with members of similar economic performances interests and ambitions 1416 this solution benefits northern states because they no longer have to worry about regulating their export surpluses and meeting the eurozone average southern states are then relieved from meeting the high export levels of germany and would be simply required to have more exports than imports which would be significantly easier to do they would be protected from devaluation inflation devaluation cycles and currency speculators attacks moreover debt restructuring procedures would be created for the states that are facing bankruptcy lastly it s a viable compromise for the two extreme economic situations germany and greece who have been openly questioning the value of the eurozone the two speed euro could even enable states like denmark and sweden who were previously opposed to the eurozone to partake in the second tier euro the second tier benefits could get other existing eu members such as poland to join the eurozone and can maybe even attract switzerland and norway as well furthermore this could be an incentive for future eu members most candidates do not have economies strong enough to be on the first tier and would greatly benefit from the being part of the second tier by being second tier eu members they would not risk to face the calamities that greece did when they adopted the existing euro it would potentially be easier to meet economic eu membership requirements when there is a two speed euro system meaning enlargement prospects like serbia and montenegro could more easily join the european union without the headaches of pledging progress over a five or ten year timeline as scharpf also suggests the two tiers aren t hard divisions countries that demonstrate tremendous progress and commitment to the sgp s economic benchmarks may move freely between the tiers operating in whichever system is more appropriate for their gdp summary considering the unreliability of the agency charged with overseeing economic progress of member states the european union needs to take immediate action to mitigate the risk of prospective enlargement countries one form that takes is what i ve referred to as a front end solution in which the barrier to entry be raised such that the european union doesn t allow countries to enter and pledge economic progress only to fall short when the ecofin committee fails to enforce convergence meanwhile back end solutions like robert mundell s concept equalization payments which seeks to stabilize national differences are also necessary this policy would use information campaigns to garner support for a redistribution of resources from wealthier eurozone countries to less developed ones helping to synchronize business cycles disperse currency risks across europe and reduce the possibility and severity of another recession another back end solution is a two speed euro system a system which divides the eurozone into two tiers of economic performance and stability this system would further accelerate economic integration and coordination among states with similar economic conditions while addressing differences in national economies this article was adapted

in the 21st century it is time to upgrade our economic model from one of feudal exploitation to a cooperative democracy that recognizes the needs contributions and inalienable rights of all participants home ownership has been called the quintessential american dream yet today less than 65 of american homes are owner occupied and more than 50 of the equity in those homes is owned by the banks compare china where despite facing one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world a whopping 90 of families can afford to own their homes over the last decade american wages have stagnated and u s productivity has consistently been outpaced by china s the u s government has responded by engaging in a trade war and imposing stiff tariffs in order to penalize china for what the white house deems unfair trade practices china s industries are said to be propped up by the state and to have significantly lower labor costs allowing them to dump cheap products on the u s market causing prices to fall and forcing u s companies out of business the message to middle america is that chinese labor costs are low because their workers are being exploited in slave like conditions at poverty level wages but if that s true how is it that the great majority of chinese families own homes according to a march 2016 article in forbes 90 of families in the country own their home giving china one of the highest home ownership rates in the world what s more is that 80 of these homes are owned outright without mortgages or any other liens on top of this north of 20 of urban households own more than one home due to their communist legacy what chinese buyers get for their money is not actually ownership in perpetuity but a long term leasehold and the quality of the construction may be poor but the question posed here is how can chinese families afford the price tag for these homes in a country where the average income is only one seventh that in the united states the misleading disparity between u s and chinese incomes some commentators explain the phenomenon by pointing to cultural differences the chinese are inveterate savers with household savings rates that are more than double those in the u s and they devote as much as 74 of their money to housing under china s earlier one child policy many families had only one heir who tended to be male and home ownership was a requirement to score a wife families would therefore pool their resources to make sure their sole heir was equipped for the competition homes would be purchased either with large down payments or without financing at all financing through banks at compound interest rates doubles the cost of a typical mortgage so sidestepping the banks cuts the cost of housing in half those factors alone however cannot explain the difference in home ownership rates between the two countries the average middle class u s family could not afford to buy a home outright for their oldest heir even if they did pool their money americans would be savers if they could but they have other bills to pay and therein lies a major difference between chinese and american family wealth in china the cost of living is significantly lower the chinese government subsidizes not only its industries but its families with educational medical and transportation subsidies according to a 2017 hsbc fact sheet 70 of chinese millennials ages 19 to 36 already own their own homes american young people cannot afford to buy homes because they are saddled with student debt a millstone that now averages 37 000 per student and will be carried an average of 20 years before it is paid off a recent survey found that 80 of american workers are living paycheck to paycheck another found that 60 of u s millennials could not come up with 500 to cover their tax bills in china by contrast student debt is virtually nonexistent heavy government subsidies have made higher education cheap enough that students can work their way through college with a part time job health care is also subsidized by the government with a state run health insurance program similar to canada s the program doesn t cover everything but medical costs are still substantially lower than in the u s public transportation too is quite affordable in china and it is fast efficient and ubiquitous the disparity in incomes between american and chinese workers is misleading for other reasons the average income includes the very rich along with the poor in the u s the gap between those two classes is greater than in china the oversize incomes at the top pull the average up even worse however is the disparity in debt levels which pulls disposable income down a survey after the 2008 09 credit crisis found that household debt in the u s was 136 of household income compared with only 17 for the chinese another notable difference is that 70 of chinese family wealth comes not from salaries but from home ownership itself under communism all real property was owned by the state when deng xiaoping opened the market to private ownership families had an opportunity to get a home on reasonable terms and as new homes were built they traded up building the family asset base deng s market liberalization also gave families an income boost by allowing them to become entrepreneurs new family owned businesses sprang up aided by affordable loans cheap credit from state owned banks subsidized state affiliated industries as well quantitative easing with chinese characteristics all this was done with the help of china s federal government which in recent decades has pumped massive amounts of economic stimulus into the economy unlike the u s federal reserve s quantitative easing which went straight into big bank reserve accounts the chinese stimulus has generated new money for productive purposes including local business development and infrastructure sometimes called qualitative easing this quantitative easing with chinese characteristics has meant more jobs more gdp and more money available to spend which in turn improves quality of life the chinese government has done this without amassing a crippling federal debt or triggering runaway inflation in the last 20 years its m2 money supply has grown from just over 10 trillion yuan to 80 trillion yuan 11 6t a nearly 800 increase yet the inflation rate of its consumer price index cpi has remained low in february of this year it was just 1 5 in may it rose to 2 7 due to an outbreak of swine fever which drove pork prices up but this was a response to shortages not to an increase in the money supply radically increasing the money supply has not driven consumer prices up because gdp has increased at an even faster rate supply and demand have risen together keeping consumer prices low real estate prices on the other hand have skyrocketed 325 in the last two decades fueled by a chinese shadow banking system that is largely beyond regulatory control pundits warn that china s housing is in an unsustainable bubble that will pop but the chinese housing market is still more stable than the u s subprime market before 2008 with its no doc no down loans chinese buyers typically put 40 to 50 down on their homes and the demand for houses remains high the central bank is also taking steps to cool the market by targeting credit so that it is steered away from real estate and other existing assets and toward newly produced goods and services that central bank intervention illustrates another difference between chinese style qualitative easing and western style qe the people s bank of china is not trying to improve banking sector liquidity so that banks can make more loans chinese economists say they don t need that form of qe china s banks are already lending and the central bank has plenty of room to manipulate interest rates and control the money supply china s central bank is directing credit into the local economy because it doesn t trust the private financial market to allocate credit where local markets need it true to its name the people s bank of china seems actually to be a people s bank geared to serving the economy and the public rather than just the banks themselves time for more qe in early april president trump said in one of his many criticisms of the u s central bank that he thought the fed should be doing more quantitative easing expanding the money supply rather than quantitative tightening shrinking the money supply commentators were left scratching their heads because the official u s unemployment rate is considered to be low but more qe could be a good idea if it were done as chinese style qualitative easing a form of monetary expansion that would allow congress to relieve medical and educational costs grant cheap credit to states to upgrade their roads and mass transit and support local businesses could go a long way toward making american workers competitive with chinese workers unlike the u s government the chinese government supports its workers and its industries rather than penalizing china for that unfair trade practice perhaps the u s government should try doing the same china s legacy is socialist and after opening to international trade it has continued to serve the collective good particularly of its workers meanwhile the u s model has been regressing into feudalism with workers driven into slave like conditions through debt in the 21st century it is time to upgrade our economic model from one of feudal exploitation to a cooperative democracy that recognizes the needs

after the trump administration announced that it would raise tariffs to 25 percent on 200 billion of chinese goods the outside world is observing how the new tariff policy will affect the chinese economy news analysis after the trump administration announced that it would raise tariffs to 25 percent on 200 billion of chinese goods the outside world is observing how the new tariff policy will affect the chinese economy so far economic indicators are pointing negatively according to data released jointly by the national bureau of statistics nbs and the federation of logistics and purchasing the official manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi fell to 49 4 in may from 50 1 in the previous month hitting a three month low and falling into the sub 50 point contraction range china s official pmi was lower than market expectations of 49 9 the non manufacturing pmi was 54 3 unchanged from the previous month overall pmi of 53 3 down 0 1 points from the previous month pmi at large enterprises was 50 3 which was 0 5 points lower than that of the previous month and still above the critical point the pmi of small and medium sized enterprises was 48 8 and 47 8 which were 0 3 and 2 0 points lower than the previous month in response the china finance network says that the manufacturing boom showed fluctuation and that demand slowed down in terms of demand the new order index was 49 8 down 1 6 points from the previous month and manufacturing market demand weakened both imports and exports fell the new export order index and import index were 46 5 and 47 1 down 2 7 and 2 6 points respectively from the previous month in may the manufacturing industry index fell to 47 0 the lowest level in at least the past year the expected index of production and operation activities fell to 54 5 the lowest level since january hong kong economic times quoted zhang liqun a special analyst of the federation of logistics and purchasing as saying the pmi index continued to decline in may and the decline increased indicating that downward pressure on the economy has increased in may the pmi index fell back below the 50 level which denotes a contraction it shows that the foundation for economic stability has yet to be established according to the hong kong economic times the data shows that domestic and foreign demand is weakening pressure is resurfacing and industrial production has slowed down combined with a significant increase in external uncertainty due to the ongoing china u s trade war and china s economic growth momentum may weaken in the second quarter the latest data released by the nbs shows that the profits of industrial enterprises above a designated size in april was 515 4 billion yuan 74 billion an annualized reduction of 3 7 percent this is the biggest monthly decline since december 2015 and analysts believe that domestic industrial companies profits will continue to decline china is also facing the problem of large companies leaving the country recently the united states announced a survey report in the american chamber of commerce in china where 40 7 percent of the 250 u s companies polled have or are considering withdrawing from china a survey by consulting firm bain co found that about 60 percent of the 200 u s companies it surveyed will reassess its global supply chain in the coming year 14 million people may be left unemployed at the political bureau of the communist party of china s mid year meeting at the end of july 2018 xi jinping called for six stabilities stable employment stable finance stable foreign trade stable foreign investment stable investment and stable expectations having undergone a lengthy period of indoctrination by the chinese communist party ccp the chinese people have a sensitivity toward chinese official discourse not shared by the outside world allowing them to understand its underlying meaning the point of introducing such six stabilities is that these six aspects are likely to have problems of these unemployment is the biggest problem china will face in the next two years american economist xia yeliang told the epoch times that the new tariff increase will directly affect china s gdp growth and may cause 14 million people in china to lose their jobs some institutions estimate that it will affect 0 4 or 0 5 others say it will affect 2 i personally prefer the latter judgment if it affects 2 of gdp growth it means that china has a large number of people who are unemployed in the past there was a calculation that every gdp percentage increase would carry 7 million jobs if its 2 percentage points then it is 14 million in turn if you lose two percentage points it means that the number of unemployed people in china will increase by 14 million china s economic growth figures have fallen to their lowest since 1990 the low value added processing industry that has supported the chinese economy for the past 20 years is currently facing great difficulties dongguan guangdong province dubbed the manufacturing capital of china by having led china urban economic growth for 20 of the past 30 years is a typical example of the chinese economy about 60 to 70 percent of its hong kong taiwanese and japanese funded processing enterprises have moved to southeast asia and the number of workers employed in these factories have decreased significantly in the various towns under dongguan s jurisdiction the total resident population has decreased by 20 percent in the past year and the maximum reduction is nearly 40 percent though according to official data the city grew by 7 percent during 2018 but most of the growth came from rising real estate prices the government s large fixed asset investment and investment formed from downstream industries that moved in from shenzhen currently the unemployed population in dongguan has not caused any stability issues due to the fact that the majority of unemployed are so called migrant workers who are forced to leave the city and return to the countryside or other places where they can find work but when all of china faces similar problems this accumulation of pressure will become a huge problem facing the government according to the ccp s official documents the focus of employment stability will be resolving the employment issues of college graduates migrant workers and retired military personnel chinese university graduates will reach 9 million this year retired military personnel who need to be resettled including from the current year and from prior total nearly 10 million baoshang bank foreshadows wave of bankruptcy financial stability is the second of the six stabilities raised by xi due to the fact that through two decades of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies chinese banks have accumulated a large amount of debt today this has basically reached an unmanageable state where alongside the sharp increase in debt banks also eventually face the problem of repayment this has led beijing to predict that a large number of banks will fall into technical bankruptcy on may 24 the central bank and the china insurance regulatory commission jointly issued an announcement that baoshang bank will be taken over by the banking insurance regulatory commission for one year the announcement was subsequently uploaded to wechat but was immediately deleted by authorities bank practitioners allege that this is the first bank in china to be taken over by the china insurance regulatory commission due to credit risk as to the reason for the takeover insiders close to the baoshang bank told xiaojinjie website that there are too many bad debts that cannot be recovered baoshang was formerly one of the first seven city commercial banks to receive the lowest risk rating from the china banking regulation commission within the field taken over is a placeholder term for bankruptcy for a model bank to meet with such an outcome the outside world predicts that a wave of small bank bankruptcies could soon follow this is due to the fact that baoshang bank s takeover is a microcosm of the mainland bank problem for a long time equity structure chaotic corporate governance illegal lending asset and liability inversion and asset quality deterioration have been common problems in the development of many small and medium sized banks when the economy declines such risks are exposed businessperson wen li told to free asia that most rural commercial banks and city commercial banks use the former credit cooperative system and there have always been problems with personnel and operations however in the past the flow of funds brought about by the economic upswing covered up this problem but as the economy declines and cash inflows slowdown such problems will become exposed according to free asia the city commercial banks and the rural commercial banks are closely connected to the regional economy because of the strong regional nature of their business as the downward pressure on the economy increases city commercial banks and rural commercial banks in some regions with poor economic conditions can go bankrupt at any time at the same time because the major shareholders of these banks are either local governments or private enterprises the general governance structure and risk control have been weak for a long time and many banks have become cash machines for local governments or private enterprises on may 29 quanshangcn the official public wechat account of news outlet securities cited information from financial regulators stating that due to serious credit risks a group of rural and urban commercial banks are now on the verge of technical bankruptcy citing the central bank financial stability report 2018 in the first quarter of 2018 the people s bank of china completed the first central bank financial institution rating for over 4 000 financial institutions of which 420 institutions scored between the ratings of 8 and 10 the classification for a high risk financial institution the report was later deleted in fact many banks in the mainland have long gone bankrupt if measured by the standards of international practice in the early years when bank assets were stolen by a few high ranking ccp officials or bank executives such banking loopholes could be covered up by the illusion of prosperity created by the government today corrupt officials are omnipresent and non high ranking cadres and bank employees also engage in underhanded practices with the baoshang bank that was taken over this time the two department managers of its beijing branch illegally provided loans of 200 million yuan in order to receive 532 000 yuan in benefits starting from loans released in november 2013 none of the bank s principal amount has been recovered with only a portion of the interest being recovered the two department managers illegal lending could be just the tip of the iceberg for baoshang bank baoshang bank is believed to have connections reaching all the way to the highest levels of the ccp solutions china may adopt according to experts china may try to solve existing problems by continued use of loose monetary policy economist mr cheng said to free asia that authorities methods for reparation are still limited to that of capital injection he also believes that including trade wars if a certain degree is reached the government will still rely on exporting financial subsidies irrespective of cost to exchange for foreign exchange he believes that like the tens of millions of people who have starved to death officials will not take heed of the harm that inflation brings to the people
the lingering challenges on the economic front coupled with increasing political turmoil are giving rise to disturbing developments at a time when the focus of the ruling elite must have been on steering the country out of crisis mode however this wish is unlikely to be granted because the stage is set for the eruption of another political upheaval and having no insight the crisis is seen deepening in weeks and months ahead within next two weeks pakistan s economic managers must focus on two important issues first is the passing of the budget 2019 20 in a smooth manner so that all prior conditions of the international monetary fund imf could be fulfilled and advisor to pm on finance dr abdul hafeez shaikh and governor state bank of pakistan sbp raza baqir will be able to sign letter of intent loi after completion of macroeconomic and financial policies mefp framework on the basis of which the imf s executive board will consider pakistan s request of 6 billion under 39 months extended fund facility eff probably next month second the financial action task force fatf is scheduled to meet in usa this week and the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti government led by cricketer turned politician imran khan must ensure smooth sailing through raising diplomatic and political support of at least three countries to avoid ending up in the blacklist this is the most important requirement demanding full attention of the incumbent regime on the economic front the government claims that they inherited an economy that was already in shambles its official documents presented before the highest economic decision making constitutional forum of national economic council nec argued that the outgoing fiscal year 2018 19 started with the highest ever current and fiscal deficits coupled with rising inflation structural and macroeconomic imbalances of acute nature could not be sustained for longer period of time and thus an adjustment process that started in december 2017 started taking its toll on growth momentum keeping in view the macroeconomic imbalances in the last two fiscal years 2017 and 2018 the slowdown was forecast even in january 2018 projections of the imf world bank and asian development bank adb the highly overvalued exchange rate that persisted for three consecutive years has inflicted irreparable damage to the prospects of the economy the economic growth decelerated from 5 5 percent in 2017 18 to 3 3 percent in 2018 19 agriculture faced a long dry spell during the last almost two years it had serious repercussions for the output of the farming sector which continued to put up a poor show it registered only 0 8 percent growth during the past five years the external account adjustment was successful as the current account deficit during the third quarter of 2018 19 has almost halved over the second quarter however fiscal deficit adjustment could not achieve desired results owing to massive tax short fall and rising debt servicing liabilities due to increasing interest rates both in internal and external markets as well as 34 percent depreciation during the last 12 months the rupee is still trapped in a devaluation spiral and there s no knowing where it s going to end it is imperative for the pti led regime to take masses into confidence instead of allowing uncertainty to continue to weigh on the economy against desired gdp growth of 6 2 percent based upon sectoral growth projections for agriculture industry and services at 3 8 percent 7 6 percent and 6 5 percent respectively the actual growth turned out to be at 3 3 percent supported by agriculture 0 85 percent industry 1 4 percent and services 4 7 percent the growth target was ambitious at the time of its presentation and it became a big question when agriculture sector faced unprecedented water scarcity as water supply was inadequate for kharif and rabi crops the large scale manufacturing sector had already started decelerating since april 2018 and continued to register negative growth construction sector remained victim of shrinking public sector development programme psdp and ban on non filer for different transactions services sector performance also came under stress owing to the spillover of the commodity sector and lower imports debt servicing cost also increased with rupee depreciation further widening fiscal deficit amid limited sources of revenue generation these factors acted as a drag on overall growth and the gross domestic product gdp growth was registered at 3 3 percent in 2018 19 the total investment for 2018 19 was recorded at 15 4 percent of the gdp lower than the target of 17 2 percent and also actual 16 7 percent in 2017 18 fixed investment to gdp ratio stood at 13 8 percent in 2018 19 lower than last year s 15 1 percent national savings was 11 1 percent of gdp which is below the target of 13 1 percent but higher than last year s 10 4 percent of the gdp fiscal deficit is likely to widen further in the year under review primarily because of revenue shortfall and rising expenditure demand revenue shortfall is the culmination of demand compression with rs70 billion due to lower petroleum products imports plus relief provided in the sales tax by reducing it to 17 percent as compared to the past 25 30 percent import compression of other items also cost in terms of foregone revenues of rs25 billion supreme court ruled to withhold another rs40 billion on mobile phones calls rs40 billion is the impact of last government s tax incentives to taxpayers during the first nine months of the current year fiscal performance is characterised by substantial rise in the fiscal deficit to 5 percent of the gdp in july march 2018 19 as compared to 4 3 percent during july march 2017 18 consolidated total revenue stood at rs3 583 7 billion which is 0 04 percent higher than the total revenue of rs3 582 4 billion collected during the same period of the last year the policy rate stood at 12 25 percent which implies an increase of 650 basis points since january 2018 money supply m2 grew by 3 9 percent rs 625 2 billion during july april 2018 19 as compared to 4 1 percent rs601 8 billion during the corresponding period of the last year scheduled banks witnessed net contraction of rs2 131 7 billion during july april 2018 19 as compared to retirement of rs466 billion in the comparable period last year the government borrowing from the sbp increased substantially and stood at rs3204 7 billion as compared to rs1 316 billion last year notwithstanding fuelling inflationary expectations this shift in borrowing from scheduled banks to sbp may create space for credit to private sector which expanded by rs580 9 billion during july april 2018 19 compared to the expansion of rs498 4 billion last year inflation remained on an upward trajectory during 2018 19 inflationary pressures initially emanated from non food side but after december 2018 food inflation became major a driver of inflation headline inflation averaged at 7 percent for july april 2018 19 compared to 3 7 percent in july april 2017 18 average sensitive price index spi was also higher in july april 2018 19 at 4 percent as against 0 8 percent in july april 2016 17 similarly average wholesale price index wpi stood at 11 7 percent in the same period compared to 2 8 percent last year the inflation in the first ten months has increased mainly because of unprecedented supply shocks in the case of essential food items such as tomatoes and green chilies a higher than anticipated increase in international oil prices an upward revision in domestic gas prices a further increase in regulatory duties on imports and the continuing second round impact of previous exchange rate depreciations the current account deficit for july march 2018 19 stood at 9 58 billion compared to 13 58 billion in july march 2016 17 indicating some improvement in current account deficit which stood at 4 4 percent of gdp now compared to 5 7 percent in july march 2017 18 the trade deficit during the first nine months of 2018 19 stood at 21 3 billion with exports of 18 billion and imports of 39 3 billion during july march 2018 19 exports decreased by 1 3 percent compared to an increase of 11 9 percent in july march 2017 18 whereas imports declined by 4 9 percent compared to an increase of 18 8 percent in comparable period of 2017 18 with this dismal performance on all macroeconomic fronts the government s expectations of generating fedral board of revenue s collection to the tune of rs5 555 billion will be highly ambitious and possesses potential risk to derail the next imf program anytime in next fiscal year the writer is a staff member

drivers of underlying inflation in the euro area over time a phillips curve perspective prepared by elena bobeica and andrej sokol published as part of the ecb economic bulletin issue 4 2019 in this article we review the evolution of euro area hicp inflation excluding energy and food since the great financial crisis through the lens of the phillips curve this period is particularly interesting as the euro area experienced two recessions in 2008 2009 and 2011 2014 and a protracted episode of low inflation from 2013 onwards we estimate a large set of phillips curve models for the euro area and review the interpretation of inflation developments that they provide over time we find that our models can account for much of the weakness in underlying inflation between 2013 and mid 2017 but that they cannot account for the weakness in underlying inflation towards the end of our sample 1 motivation and overview the decade since the onset of the great financial crisis in 2008 is known for a twin puzzle in inflation developments across advanced economies the first years following the crisis are associated with a missing disinflation episode as inflation appeared to fall by less than the ensuing recessions would have led us to expect more recently as most economies gradually recovered economists have puzzled over missing inflation with the latter episode being much more prolonged taking averages since the launch of the euro as benchmarks in the euro area both headline hicp inflation and hicp inflation excluding energy and food hicpx henceforth underlying inflation dropped below their respective averages after 2009 see chart 1 but the missing disinflation view would have predicted an even more marked fall after a short lived recovery inflation rates again fell from 2013 onwards initiating a protracted period of below average inflation which in the case of underlying inflation persists to the present day the missing inflation view finds the latter episode hard to square with a gradual recovery in economic activity in the euro area that has brought the unemployment rate back to pre crisis levels see chart 2 chart 1 hicp inflation and hicp inflation excluding

and food and the unemployment rate in the euro area annual percentage changes right hand scale percentages left hand scale inverted source eurostat both academics and practitioners use versions of the phillips curve to understand and communicate inflation developments in the broadest sense the phillips curve is an expression of the notion in economic theory that economic activity and more precisely the degree of excess demand or supply should have a bearing on price and inflation developments the relationship is grounded in many popular economic theories such as the new keynesian framework where inflation is primarily linked to firms marginal costs often proxied with a measure of economic slack and forward looking inflation expectations phillips curves have long enjoyed great popularity as an empirical tool but for that very reason the missing disinflation and missing inflation episodes have stirred intense debates about the relationship including whether it is alive or dead i e steep or flat and linear or non linear attempts to simply link the behaviour of inflation to the level of economic activity raise some important questions for instance a naïve look at the stability of such a relationship see chart 3 would suggest that compared with the pre crisis period the link between real activity and inflation might have flattened in the following period which includes the two puzzling episodes but many economic factors can shift the level of inflation for a given amount of economic slack blurring the underlying economic relationship when viewed in a scatterplot for example inflation expectations and the cost of imported inputs are important elements of price setting decisions and their changes can lead to shifts in the phillips curve relationship without necessarily changing its slope on the other hand the behaviour of economic agents could change over time for example depending on whether the economy is in recession or not meaning that the slope could vary over different periods without appropriately taking into account such considerations there is a risk of drawing the wrong conclusions about the strength of the link between inflation and economic activity chart 3 hicpx inflation and the unemployment rate in the euro area x axis percentages y axis annual percentage changes sources eurostat and ecb calculations note linear regression lines for the two samples are shown in grey the ecb has also relied on phillips curve models to understand and communicate inflation developments since the great financial crisis the phillips curve is an intuitive yet powerful way of conveying the link between inflation and economic activity which lies at the heart of monetary policy thus as in other central banks and policy institutions see box 1 for some case studies phillips curves are one element of the analytical toolkit routinely deployed by the ecb to analyse and communicate inflation and wage growth developments reduced form estimates of this relationship remain popular due to their simplicity and transparency however they require regular review and scrutiny in order to remain useful for analytical decision making and communication purposes this includes all the important choices that have to be made for their empirical set up for instance whether to focus on headline inflation which is more exposed to commodity prices and other external shocks or on measures of underlying inflation what is the most appropriate measure of economic activity to use what other global and or domestic drivers of inflation besides economy activity should be included and whether the relationship should be allowed to change in more complex ways for example depending on the stage of the economic cycle section 2 and box 2 focus on some of these important issues in section 3 we then revisit the recent history of inflation in the euro area through the lens of a large set of reduced form phillips curve models and find that estimated phillips curves can account for much of the weakness in underlying inflation since 2013 imputing the bulk of it to its key determinants except for the last few outturns which cannot be explained well by our models box 1 other countries experiences with phillips curves prepared by alexander al haschimi major central banks use the phillips curve to assess and communicate inflation developments for instance the federal reserve system tracks closely how well phillips curves estimated using a variety of approaches can explain data on the us economy some results suggest that in the united states the link between unemployment and inflation has weakened over time indeed in recent years the united states has been experiencing both low unemployment and low inflation concurrently which is consistent with a flatter phillips curve federal reserve chair jerome powell has argued that a number of factors have weakened the effect of labour market tightness on inflation one factor cited was a more effective conduct of monetary policy resulting in a stronger anchoring of inflation expectations other factors potentially relate to the internationalisation of production structures and the higher import content of goods consumed which give exchange rates and global prices a greater role in price determination a related question particularly relevant given the very tight labour markets in some advanced economies including the united states and japan is to what extent the phillips curve is non linear in his remarks at the 2019 us monetary policy forum john williams also discussed the possibility that the employment inflation relationship becomes strong only when unemployment is very low as suggested by hooper mishkin and sufi 2019 this finding would be highly policy relevant as it suggests that while thus far a tight labour market has co existed with low inflation a further tightening in the us labour market may lead to inflation rising above target williams pointed out that the results for this type of non linearity in the phillips curve are often not robust but their existence would significantly alter the policy trade offs a central bank is facing in japan the linearity of the phillips curve has also been questioned japan has also been experiencing a tight labour market and low inflation which could be an indication of a flatter phillips curve there are a number of potential explanations for why the country s low unemployment rate does not feed through more strongly to wage and price inflation some factors cited are structural and relate in part to worker preferences for employment stability over wage increases as well as hidden labour market slack arising from involuntary part time workers who are not fully captured by the unemployment rate however as in the united states there is a debate as to when the low and falling unemployment rate should lead to stronger increases in wages and prices harada 2018 recently discussed this issue within a phillips curve framework he showed estimates suggesting that inflation becomes more responsive to the labour market when the unemployment rate falls below 3 and concluded that this could imply that the unemployment rate needed to decline further for inflation to reach its target of 2 see chart a chart a phillips curve for japan x axis percentages y axis annual percentage changes

models for euro area underlying inflation what are the choices we follow a thick modelling approach and bring a large number of reduced form single equation phillips curve models to the data as emphasised in ecb 2014 there are countless similarly plausible empirical specifications of the phillips curve reflecting various choices such as the variables to be included the functional form and the estimation strategy one way to mitigate some of this model uncertainty is to choose a generic specification and estimate different versions of it changing how we measure each variable an approach referred to as thick modelling the general specification is the following π t c γ π t 1 α π t e β x t 1 γ z t l ε t where π t is inflation π t e is a measure of inflation expectations x t is a measure of economic activity or slack and z t l captures external price shocks which in some specifications are allowed to enter the equation with a longer lag l to allow for a slower pass through to domestic prices the choice of functional form and estimation strategy addresses tractability and simplicity concerns but also reflects the proven ability of such models to fit euro area data reasonably well effectively the model is an empirical version of a hybrid new keynesian phillips curve where inflation is driven by forward looking inflation expectations proxied here by survey measures past inflation is allowed to play a role as well to capture backward looking expectations and other sources of persistence in price setting and firms marginal costs are proxied by measures of slack or economic activity external variables are included to control for an important source of supply side shocks figure 1 offers a synopsis of the main specification choices without aiming to be exhaustive on all possible counts figure 1 stylised decision tree for the specification of a reduced form phillips curve model source ecb while the objective of the ecb is unambiguously defined in terms of headline hicp inflation in this article we focus on measures of underlying inflation which are less volatile and can help to identify and illustrate the key drivers of price developments see figure 1 panel a developments in total consumer price index cpi inflation may be temporarily influenced by factors that are of a short term nature such as swings in commodity prices in order to focus on the more persistent factors driving inflation in many empirical applications of the phillips curve model and beyond underlying inflation measures are used instead however there are many available measures of underlying inflation popular choices include permanent exclusion measures such as hicp inflation excluding energy and food temporary exclusion measures and model based measures we use several measures of economic slack or activity to capture the impact of firms costs on inflation see figure 1 panel b most empirical approaches assume that marginal costs are proportional to economic slack proxied by the output gap or the unemployment gap such unobservable gaps can be obtained by applying statistical filtering techniques via estimates of potential output based on a production function e g oecd or imf methodologies or endogenously in a manner consistent with inflation developments as in blanchard et al 2015 jarociński and lenza 2018 and chan et al 2016 using multiple measures is one way of mitigating the model uncertainty inevitably surrounding estimates of economic slack another approach is to directly use observable measures of economic activity such as the unemployment rate or gdp growth which however has the significant downside of blurring demand and supply factors more recently several studies have recommended using the short term unemployment rate or gap instead of total unemployment measures regardless of the reference measure additional complications arise from estimating slack in real time partly related to the potentially large revisions to some of the macro data used to proxy slack we use available survey measures to proxy inflation expectations see figure 1 panel c the inflation expectations of firms and workers consumers are not available for most countries so several strategies have been adopted to address the issue backward looking expectations i e assuming that they are based on past inflation are the simplest one and the inclusion of a lagged inflation term in equation 1 is partly motivated by this to measure forward looking expectations survey measures are a convenient way to proxy the beliefs of economic agents regarding future price movements their main caveat is that such surveys usually reflect expectations of professional forecasters which could differ markedly from those of price setters or consumers we also control for external supply side shocks that might hit domestic prices see figure 1 panel d in an increasingly globalised world both domestic headline and underlying inflation can be sensitive to various external supply side shocks such as those coming from commodity and other import prices there is some empirical evidence for the united states and other countries that import prices do affect inflation in a phillips curve framework on the other hand there is less empirical support when it comes to an independent influence of the global business cycle on domestic inflation the relevant variables to include are not the only source of uncertainty in the phillips curve the functional form matters as well the choice of specification is often driven by the scope and purpose of the analysis for example if a linear specification turns out not to offer a satisfactory explanation of outcomes non linear specifications can be deployed box 2 discusses some important departures from the linear benchmark model in equation 1 in the context of recent ecb work on phillips curves we estimate 550 versions of the baseline model and find the euro area phillips curve to be alive but we also find evidence pointing to the importance of inflation drivers other than domestic real activity estimation results point to a statistically significant and economically plausible link between euro area inflation and its key drivers focusing on the relationship with real activity chart 4 shows the phillips curve slope across specifications for each measure of slack or economic activity in virtually all 550 models under review the real activity measure is statistically significant with the theoretically implied sign confirming the visual impression given in chart 2 regarding the co movement between underlying inflation and economic activity in the euro area however the slope is generally not very steep and the coefficients of other relevant drivers such as inertia expectations and external shocks are often also significant pointing to the importance of factors beyond slack for adequately explaining inflation developments in other words not only movements along the phillips curve but also shifts in the curve need to be taken into account chart 4 estimated phillips curve slope across all specifications regression coefficients on standardised measures of economic slack

across specifications the vertical bars show the range of coefficients across all specifications including a particular measure of economic slack tightness or activity box 2 linear and non linear phillips curves prepared by andrej sokol empirical phillips curve models are often linear equation 1 in section 2 is a fairly standard specification of a single equation linear phillips curve where lagged inflation a measure of slack a measure of inflation expectations and a measure of import prices are included linearity refers both to linearity of the parameters the right hand side term is a linear function and of the variables i e variables enter the equation with the units they are measured in both assumptions can be relaxed in a number of ways there are several possible non linear specifications of the phillips curve the most common forms of non linearity include transformations of the independent variables such as square or even higher order slack terms which can introduce both convexity and concavity in phillips curves similar and more sophisticated relationships can be fitted by weighting the slack measure with another variable that captures the state of the economy for example a simple dummy variable can achieve several forms of piecewise linearity which can approximate different regimes such as booms and deep recessions as opposed to normal times more sophisticated devices such as non linear splines or markov switching are sometimes also used in the estimation of non linear phillips curves behind the notion of a non linear phillips curve often lies the idea that pricing behaviour could be different at different stages of the economic cycle this in turn might be due to psychological institutional or technological considerations and their interplay in a modern market economy one argument with a long history relates to downward nominal wage rigidities i e workers being reluctant to accept or firms to impose cuts in nominal wages in a downturn this could be due to collective bargaining arrangements or a psychological reluctance to see one s pay cut in nominal terms the implication is that in the presence of a large amount of economic slack wages and therefore prices will change at a different rate than during more normal periods thus potentially bending the phillips curve into a more convex shape a similar phenomenon can occur if firms experience short run capacity constraints that make it difficult to immediately satisfy further increases in demand one example would be mothballed equipment that can only be put back into use with a time lag and at some cost in such a situation firms might increase prices before increasing their capacity to fully satisfy the additional demand whereas in more normal times they would adjust inputs to production first thus again making the phillips curve more convex another source of convexity is the idea that price changes could be more frequent in periods of high inflation some theories predict a concave rather than a convex phillips curve i e inflation being more responsive to slack when there is a large amount of it than in normal times or booms for example this is consistent with firms operating in market structures where they can make different pricing decisions depending on market conditions when there is a large amount of slack firms may be more willing to cut prices in order not to lose market share to rival firms conversely firms might be reluctant to increase prices in periods when output is close to or above potential to avoid losing market share convexity and concavity do not need to be mutually exclusive one way to reconcile the presence of both are threshold effects namely a steeper relationship between inflation and slack only for extreme values of the slack variable e g during deep recessions and or after prolonged periods of above trend growth one microeconomic notion consistent with such a set up is that prices are more responsive when there is a lot of slack because firms do not want to lose market share or when firms are operating way above potential because of higher costs and less responsive in between when adjusting factor utilisation is preferred to changing prices in such a case the phillips curve is concave when there is a lot of slack and convex when the economy is operating considerably above potential other microeconomic arguments for non linearity do not fit the convexity concavity dichotomy as neatly but may nonetheless be important this may either be because they only operate during upturns or downturns or because they depend on the rate at which slack is closing menu costs are one example when firms face costs to change their prices typically only a fraction of them will adjust prices in a given period but it is likely that the larger the demand shock they face the greater the share of firms adjusting their prices will be in such a case the rate at which slack closes or opens up will determine the slope of the phillips curve for any given level of slack chart b euro area phillips curve slopes in two samples across a range of specifications regression coefficients on standardised measures of economic slack tightness sources european commission ecb eurostat imf oecd and ecb calculations note slack measures are as in chart 4 standardised and inverted where appropriate for comparability time variation in the coefficients of an otherwise linear phillips curve is sometimes taken as first pass evidence of non linearity in the relationship between slack and inflation that is because if the pattern of variation coincides with the economic cycle then time varying parameters might be a better fit for outturns that would otherwise look non linear when viewed in slack inflation space time variation in the coefficients is in itself a form of non linearity because the parameters in the equation effectively become variables that depend on time and multiply the independent variables broadly speaking time variation has been tested in two ways either by simply splitting the sample and comparing fixed parameter estimates or by estimating models with time varying parameters both approaches provide some evidence of an increase in the slope of the euro area phillips curve in recent years although with a high degree of uncertainty chart b illustrates the results from the first approach the same models are estimated over two different samples and changes in slope across the two samples are illustrated by means of deviations from a 45 degree line quadratic slack terms and other forms of non linearity have been tested extensively with mixed results in an empirical exercise featuring a large number of different specifications quadratic slack terms which seek to introduce convexity in the relationship between slack and inflation were statistically significant in some of the specifications but in models that controlled for imported inflation that significance largely disappeared consistent with the view that linear models with suitably chosen control variables are even able to fit data well that appear non linear in a reduced form relationship see chart c in the same exercise a dummy variable for positive values of the output gap in principle able to fit both convex and concave relationships turned out to be significant only in a fraction of the models chart c share of instances in which the non linear variables in euro area phillips curve specifications are statistically significant percentages sources eurostat and ecb staff calculations notes for two measures of inflation hicp and hicpx inflation versions of equation 1 including and excluding external variables and a different form of non linearity quadratic terms for economic slack or 0 1 dummy variables for economic slack above below a certain threshold are estimated for various measures of slack see the notes to chart 4 the bars denote the share of models in which the coefficients on the non linear terms are statistically significant at the 10 level some evidence in favour of non linearity comes from considering more sophisticated threshold effects models allowing for a steeper slope of the phillips curve when slack is outside certain bounds help fit the data even when including expectations and imported inflation in the specification this is the case both when the output gap and when the unemployment gap are used as measures of slack using regime switching phillips curves where the slope is allowed to change with the level of the output gap some evidence of non linearity was found for the euro area 3 the drivers of euro area underlying inflation implied by phillips curve models phillips curve models can provide a historical perspective on the relative importance of the main drivers of underlying inflation chart 5 summarises the lessons that can be drawn from the thick modelling approach presented in the previous section by showing the average contributions to inflation all in terms of deviations from their historical averages of its three main drivers across all models considered at the onset of the great financial crisis underlying inflation was well above its historical average largely explained by the economy running at above normal capacity see the large contributions from economic tightness however as early as the second half of 2009 the inflation gap the deviation of inflation from its mean turned negative to a certain extent this was due to increasing levels of slack with the unfolding of the ensuing recession and also to a slight softening of inflation expectations but part of the weakness cannot be accounted for by our explanatory variables chart 5 phillips curve based decomposition of underlying inflation annual percentage changes and percentage point contributions all values in terms of deviations from their averages since 1999 source ecb calculations notes the bars show average contributions across all the models considered in section 2 contributions are derived as in yellen j l inflation dynamics and monetary policy speech at the philip gamble memorial lecture university of massachusetts amherst 24 september 2015 the missing disinflation and missing inflation episodes are partly reflected in phillips curve estimates the evidence presented in chart 5 supports the missing disinflation narrative from 2011 onwards when a large unexplained positive contribution to underlying inflation begins to appear one explanation put forward for this pointed to a larger impact from external factors during the recovery phase than simple phillips curve models could capture in the course of 2013 underlying inflation fell well below its historical average where it has remained until the present day the phillips curve models lend some support to this missing inflation puzzle as the negative contributions from the residuals indicate the models inability to fully account for the weakness in inflation over almost the entire period one explanation is related to pent up restraints while declines in prices and wages during the recession were limited due to downward nominal rigidities in the early phases of the recovery price and wage inflation may have been correspondingly subdued in other words the missing inflation could have been a consequence of the missing disinflation period at least in the initial stages of the economic recovery nevertheless except for the last year or so estimated phillips curves can account for much of the weakness in underlying inflation since 2013 imputing the bulk of it to its key determinants rather than to unexplained residuals the relative importance of the three key inflation drivers has changed throughout this period based on the average contributions across models in chart 5 the drag coming from economic slack dominated the picture in the early part of the period and continued to play a diminishing role until spare capacity in the euro area was largely absorbed as underlying inflation continued to turn out well below its historical average some of its weakness began being attributed to lower short to medium term inflation expectations which exerted a mild drag up to recent quarters external developments in the form of lower oil commodity and other import prices also began gradually to feed through to underlying inflation while the negative contributions of these factors had largely faded by early 2018 underlying inflation remained weak throughout 2018 the more recent weakness in underlying inflation is difficult to explain within the phillips curve framework even within our thick modelling framework the narrative summarised in chart 5 is subject to a large degree of uncertainty as different models impute inflation developments to different factors at any given point in time in the following subsections we provide a quantification of the uncertainty around the contributions of slack inflation expectations and external prices to inflation and also review some of the economic sources of such uncertainty the overall picture that emerges is that uncertainty surrounding individual drivers could potentially account for some of the unexplained residuals in chart 5 until mid 2017 but given the fading contributions of all three main drivers the more recent weakness in underlying inflation cannot be accounted for by standard phillips curve models slack slack played a leading role in explaining underlying inflation from 2013 until 2016 given the euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2010 and the ensuing recession 2011 2014 it is understandable that explanations of inflation over that period focus on the role of domestic drivers especially slack in the euro area nevertheless phillips curve models do not paint the full picture the initial fall in underlying inflation after mid 2012 was unexpected and although slack can account for the bulk of it in chart 5 unexplained factors also played a major role furthermore the range of contributions of slack to inflation across the 550 models that we estimate is particularly wide over that period see chart 6 two explanations for the difficulty in explaining inflation over that period using simple phillips curve models are a steepening of the euro area phillips curve whereby inflation would follow the business cycle much more closely and or a mismeasurement of slack namely more slack than captured by standard measures chart 6 range of contributions of slack to underlying inflation annual percentage changes

changes and percentage point contributions all values in terms of deviations from their averages since 1999 changes in phillips curve slopes and potential mismeasurement of slack add to the uncertainty surrounding the contribution of slack to inflation as early as 2014 the ecb discussed the possibility of a stronger relationship between inflation and slack and lower nominal rigidities in some euro area countries due to structural reforms being implemented are consistent with such a view nevertheless it is challenging to distinguish a change in the phillips curve slope from a mismeasurement of slack alternative estimates of slack where the output gap is required to be consistent with inflation dynamics within a stable phillips curve relationship would have to have been much larger over the missing inflation period also the legacy of the prolonged euro area sovereign debt crisis suggested that the full extent of slack in the labour market could be better captured by broadening the range of labour market indicators also taking into account workers who became discouraged or worked part time for economic reasons but phillips curves estimated with such measures would still show negative residuals in the more recent period moreover real time estimates of economic slack can be subject to large measurement error and revisions are common notwithstanding all these sources of uncertainty chart 6 suggests that over the most recent period the drag from slack has dissipated making it difficult to look to this factor to account for the unexplained negative residuals in chart 5 in the last year of the sample inflation expectations the decline in survey based measures of inflation expectations after 2013 raised some concerns that the phillips curve had shifted downwards but the message from our estimates is mixed over the period from 2014 to mid 2017 chart 5 shows that inflation expectations might have contributed to the drag on underlying inflation nevertheless as discussed in section 2 available measures of expectations are imperfect and it is sometimes difficult to interpret the signal they provide for inflation chart 7 highlights this uncertainty within our thick modelling framework the range of the contributions of expectations over the 2014 2017 period can be wide at times reflecting the fact that it covers measures with various forecast horizons including both short to medium term survey based inflation expectations which can be noisier and more closely trail developments in past inflation and long term measures of survey inflation expectations which by comparison have been more stable the most recent weakness in underlying inflation does not appear to be explained by developments in inflation expectations not only has the average contribution gradually faded towards zero but the range of contributions across models has also become remarkably small reflecting the gradual pick up in the available survey based

monetary policy speech at the philip gamble memorial lecture university of massachusetts amherst 24 september 2015 external factors global factors in general and low oil and other commodity prices in particular have featured prominently in inflation narratives over recent years chart 5 highlights the increasing drag on underlying inflation associated with external price developments from 2015 onwards underlying inflation is affected by external price movements through two main channels a direct one via the price of imported final consumption goods and an indirect one via the price of imported intermediate goods used in production within the euro area the drop in oil prices starting in mid 2014 was one of the largest since the inception of economic and monetary union emu and left its mark on the headline inflation profile for the subsequent years for underlying inflation however the negative contributions from external price developments were relatively modest when looking at the average contribution across models but for part of this period could have been substantially larger according to our range of estimates see chart 8 however over the last few quarters both the average contribution and the range around it have shrunk substantially chart 8 range of contributions of external prices to underlying inflation annual percentage changes and percentage point

as in yellen j l inflation dynamics and monetary policy speech at the philip gamble memorial lecture university of massachusetts amherst 24 september 2015 global influences on domestic inflation could extend beyond what can be captured by import and commodity prices alone but the empirical evidence on additional channels is mixed in a globalising world the inflation process might reflect increased trade flows the integration of emerging economies into the world economy and the rise of global value chains shifting parts of production abroad all these phenomena can affect inflation via numerous channels potentially with long lags and capturing their influence within a traditional phillips curve model can be empirically challenging ecb 2017 finds some support for including global measures of slack in a thick modelling phillips curve framework but overall the explanatory gains appear to be limited however despite the mixed empirical results the relatively low dispersion of inflation rates across different economies including in the case of underlying inflation see chart 9 suggests that broader structural drivers may be shaping inflation worldwide in ways that are yet to be fully grasped chart 9 dispersion of underlying inflation rates in oecd countries since 1999 standard deviations sources haver analytics ecb and eurostat note the line shows the standard deviation across

parsimonious yet not overly simplistic specification that spans the key determinants of inflation beyond the level of economic activity we combine it with a thick modelling approach that mitigates some of the pervasive model uncertainty allowing us to draw a more robust inference about the strength of the relationship between inflation and its drivers our results provide a plausible narrative for the evolution of underlying inflation in the euro area since the onset of the great financial crisis estimated phillips curves can account for much of the weakness in underlying inflation between 2013 and mid 2017 while the more recent weakness in underlying inflation remains largely unexplained the average contributions of slack inflation expectations and external prices across all estimated models can account for the bulk of the deviations of underlying inflation from its historical average over large spans of the period we consider however given the fading contributions of all three factors and the narrowing of uncertainty ranges around them over the most recent period the persistent weakness in underlying inflation highlights the need for other complementary approaches like any other analytical tool phillips curves also have limitations and shortcomings for example while being intuitive and transparent reduced form estimates are by nature partial equilibrium and thus open to both theoretical and empirical objections furthermore to remain tractable they inevitably miss many aspects for example fiscal policy and financial factors that could nonetheless be important for explaining underlying inflation but require more sophisticated modelling approaches finally statistical and measurement issues can also cause instability in phillips curve relationships over specific periods of time despite these shortcomings phillips curve models are an integral part of a much broader analytical toolkit deployed by central banks to understand the inflation process they have often provided relevant insights at times leading the way for more sophisticated approaches and at other times offering a cross check for analyses or forecasts originating elsewhere the very lively debate surrounding them bears testimony to their usefulness

since the start of the trump administration s trade war last year economists and executives have repeatedly warned that consumers will ultimately end up footing the bill for tariffs through higher prices that s true it just might not feel like it a recent economic study estimated that the 10 percent tariffs imposed last year on 200 billion in chinese products cost the average american household 414 money out of your pocket that helped cover the rising cost of importing those goods but the trade war hasn t occurred in a vacuum the financial markets have twitched with almost every tweet threat hint and official imposition of taxes made by president trump including by depressing the price of crude oil the result fear of the effects of the trade war has helped offset the effects of the trade war the things that are being hit by the tariffs are going to be more expensive said matthew luzzetti chief united states economist at deutsche bank in new york but on the other hand if oil continues to decline a big portion of the basket of goods that people consume will become cheaper that s not necessarily reason to cheer the markets are reflecting concerns that an escalating trade war the united states raised the tariff rate to 25 percent last month and has threatened to expand tariffs to an additional 300 million in chinese goods could tip the economy into a recession the effects of that would be more serious than higher consumer prices

new york last summer my colleague brunello rosa and i identified 10 potential downside risks that could trigger a us and global recession in 2020 nine of them are still in play today many involve the united states trade wars with china and other countries along with restrictions on migration foreign direct investment and technology transfers could have profound implications for global supply chains raising the threat of stagflation slowing growth alongside rising inflation and the risk of a us growth slowdown has become more acute now that the stimulus from the 2017 tax legislation has run its course meanwhile us equity markets have remained frothy since our initial commentary and there are added risks associated with the rise of newer forms of debt including in many emerging markets where much borrowing is denominated in foreign currencies with central banks ability to serve as lenders of last resort increasingly constrained illiquid financial markets are vulnerable to flash crashes and other disruptions one such disruption could come from us president donald trump who may be tempted to create a foreign policy crisis wag the dog with a country like iran that might bolster his domestic poll numbers but it could also trigger an oil shock beyond the us the fragility of growth in debt ridden china and some other emerging markets remains a concern as do economic policy financial and political risks in europe worse across the advanced economies the policy toolbox for responding to a crisis remains limited the monetary and fiscal interventions and private sector backstops used after the 2008 financial crisis simply cannot be deployed to the same effect today the tenth factor that we considered was the us federal reserve s fed interest rate policy after hiking rates in response to the trump administration s pro cyclical fiscal stimulus the fed reversed course in january looking ahead the fed and other major central banks are more likely to cut rates to manage various shocks to the global economy while trade wars and potential oil spikes constitute a supply side risk they also threaten aggregate demand and thus consumption growth because tariffs and higher fuel prices reduce disposable income with so much uncertainty companies will likely opt to reduce capital spending and investment under these conditions a severe enough shock could usher in a global recession even if central banks respond rapidly after all in 2007 2009 the fed and other central banks reacted aggressively to the shocks that triggered the global financial crisis but they did not avert the great recession today the fed is starting with a benchmark policy rate of 2 25 2 5 per cent compared with 5 25 per cent in september 2007 in europe and japan central banks are already in negative rate territory and will face limits on how much further below the zero bound they can go and with bloated balance sheets from successive rounds of quantitative easing central banks would face similar constraints if they were to return to large scale asset purchases on the fiscal side most advanced economies have even higher deficits and more public debt today than before the global financial crisis leaving little room for stimulus spending and as rosa and i argued last year financial sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near insolvent governments among the risks that could trigger a recession in 2020 the sino american trade and technology war deserves special attention the conflict could escalate further in several ways the trump administration could decide to extend tariffs to the 300 billion worth of chinese exports not yet affected or prohibiting huawei and other chinese firms from using us components could trigger a full scale process of de globalisation as companies scramble to secure their supply chains were that to happen china would have several options for retaliating against the us such as by closing its market to us multinationals like apple under such a scenario the shock to markets around the world would be sufficient to bring on a global crisis regardless of what the major central banks do with the current tensions already denting business consumer and investor confidence and slowing global growth further escalation would tip the world into a recession and given the scale of private and public debt another financial crisis would likely follow from that both trump and chinese president xi jinping know that it is in their countries interest to avoid a global crisis so they have an incentive to find a compromise in the next few months yet both sides are still ratcheting up nationalist rhetoric and pursuing tit for tat measures trump and xi each seem to think that his country s long term economic and national security may depend on his not blinking in the face of a new cold war and if they each genuinely believe the other will blink first the risk of a ruinous clash is high indeed it is possible that trump and xi will meet for talks during the g 20 summit on june 28 29 in osaka but even if they do agree to restart negotiations a comprehensive deal to settle their many points of contention would be a long way off as the two sides drift further apart the space for compromise is shrinking and the risk of a global recession and crisis in an already fragile

an ongoing economic crisis in ankara is rattling global markets itâ s been almost a decade since the lehman brothers collapse led to an unprecedented financial crisis in the years since the world has gotten used to the â goldilocks economyâ moderate and sustainable growth that s not too hot not too cold but now many worry the â turkey shockâ may bring with it another crisis that could quickly spread worldwide what is the turkey shockâ the situation can best be understood by briefly reviewing whatâ s happening in ankara turkey has been suffering from greater than 10 percent inflation the country also has high levels of foreign currency debt thatâ s leading to increasing borrowing costs on top of that donald trump recently threw another wrench in the country s economic gears one that has had international repercussions the us president had been expressing frustration over an american pastor detained in turkey and this frustration culminated in trump announcing he would double tariffs on turkish steel and aluminum now turkish steel will see a 50 percent tariff and that s led us companies to call up their turkish suppliers and cancel orders global markets responded immediately stocks plunged in tokyo new york asia and throughout europe the turkish lira fell 20 in just one day investors poured into the japanese yen as a relatively safe asset meanwhile other asian currencies were widely sold turkish president recep tayyip erdoganâ s response has only aggravated the countryâ s currency and debt crisis the central bank needs to raise its interest rates to fight the rapid currency depreciation and end the high inflation but erdogan is fiercely opposed to the move heâ s even attempting to take more direct control of the central bank fueling worries from overseas investors why are turkey s troubles becoming global concerns experts say there are 3 key factors that could make turkey s problems global ones one issue is possible spillover effects for the european economy the european central bank has expressed concern over exposure to turkey especially for spanish french and italian banks data shows that spanish banks are owed more than 80 billion dollars from turkish borrowers erdogan s refusal to seek support from the international monetary fund is not helping the situation investors in other countries are also worried about emerging economies that share common symptoms with turkey they include argentina which has been suffering from a currency crisis and asian economies such as indonesia and the philippines which have excessive foreign currency debt if capital outflows from these countries accelerate that could severely hurt or dampen growth in asia the third factor making this a global problem is actually not directly related to the turkish crisis investors are becoming more worried about china as it faces a trade row with the trump administration according to economists at mizuho research institute china could fare far worse than the us if the trade row continues their simulation shows that if bilateral trade drops by 20 china s gross domestic product will worsen by 3 triple the damage of what the us will suffer and many analysts feel that it s no coincidence that chinese officials announced they will send a trade delegation to the us in late august to resume talks amid the turkish shock what could be possible spillover effects for japan japan invests more in turkey than any other asian economy with companies like toyota motor and honda motor having production lines in the country still the amount is much smaller compared to funds invested by europe and the us therefore the direct impact of the turkish crisis may be limited but there are still reasons to stay alert a rise in the japanese yen stemming from mounting concerns over a global contagion may dampen exports a slowdown in china and other asian countries would also deal a blow to the japanese economy the turkish currency has regained ground after qatar announced 15 billion dollars in support for turkey but the problem is far from over turkey is currently celebrating bayram a national holiday the festive mood may not continue though as erdogan slaps counter tariffs on the us and promotes boycotts of us products amid the turmoil two major credit rating agencies have downgraded turkey on increased uncertainty over the countryâ s economy is the turkish crisis a wake up call indicating another looming global crisis as international cooperation becomes increasingly difficult amid global and political tensions japan may not be able to just stay on the sidelines it may have to step up efforts to smooth conflicts with the us and the rest of the world

the word dividend is like magic in the report on business newsroom judging by statistics on my own columns one dividend in the headline provides a boost to internet traffic statistics of anywhere between 50 and 150 per cent on average this sounds like a bit of a mania but why not an aging canadian population creates near bottomless demand for income products and performance of dividend heavy sectors like reits and utilities has been more than solid even if the monthly payments aren t counted a slowing global growth environment has pushed bond yields much lower in 2019 and this makes dividend stocks even more attractive by comparison morgan stanley s widely followed u s equity strategist michael wilson recently warned investors about crowding in equity income sectors but importantly his advice was tactical short term rather than an extended forecast investors have adjusted for decelerations by moving into assets with secular growth quality and some defensiveness with many counting on the same stocks to ride out a slowing growth environment a general sell off in equities could force selling and liquidity issues that impact portfolios and make certain pockets of the market act less defensively than their fundamentals would suggest the u s federal reserve s attempts to tighten u s money supply in the fourth quarter of 2018 proved premature at best the central bank was forced to backtrack on the endeavour and the dividend sectors that were hit hardest last year are among the top performing sectors of 2019 so far the fed is now expected to cut rates numerous times in the next 18 months and will be extremely reluctant to raise them for a long time afterwards while there are numerous differences between the economic conditions of the western world now and japan in the 1990s it does seem like a japan like period of ultra low rates is ahead for a long time again low rates forever situations are great for dividend stocks there is only one potential fundamental danger for dividend stocks credit quality and there s little or no signs of stress there if down the road recession conditions threaten revenue growth for dividend payers and their costs of borrowing in debt markets jumps it will be time to worry but that s down the road there is one thing about dividend stocks that concerns me and it creates a sense of unease that s hard to shake in the past when a significant segment of the investing public does the same thing buys the same type of stocks for a long time the eventual reckoning was painful there are no negative issues on the horizon for equity income investors and they should enjoy the ride it s never too early on the other hand to start devising strategies to prevent overstaying their welcome scott barlow globe and mail

each own units of brookfield infrastructure partners lp i purchased mine ticker bip on the new york stock exchange in u s dollars and she bought hers ticker bip un on the toronto stock exchange in canadian dollars our brokerage statements indicate that on dec 29 2017 the units closed at us 44 81 and 56 38 respectively on april 30 2019 they closed at us 41 38 and 55 48 so bip lost us 3 43 while bip un only fell 90 cents canadian nobody at my brokerage or the company could explain why the u s units dropped 7 7 per cent nearly five times as much as the canadian units which fell just 1 6 per cent can you help answer based on this letter and others i ve received interlisted stocks are a big source of confusion for investors with dozens of canadian companies including banks insurers utilities and energy producers trading on both sides of the border it s worth understanding why prices of interlisted stocks behave the way they do as you ll see when we dig into the brookfield infrastructure example it all comes down to currency exchange rates at the end of 2017 bip s price on the nyse was us 44 81 and the canadian dollar was trading at about 79 5 us cents to convert bip s nyse price into canadian dollars you would divide us 44 81 by 0 795 which equals 56 36 notice that this is almost identical to bip un s price on the tsx at the time of 56 38 now fast forward to april 30 2019 bip s price on the nyse was us 41 38 and the canadian dollar had fallen to about 74 7 us cents dividing us 41 38 by 0 747 gives a value of 55 39 which again is pretty close to bip un s actual price of 55 48 on the tsx keep in mind that i am using approximate exchange rates which may explain why the prices don t match exactly market inefficiencies may also play a role although any price discrepancies between the two markets would not last long as arbitrageurs would quickly close the gap the key thing to understand here is that when the exchange rate fluctuates the canadian and u s prices of an interlisted stock adjust to reflect the relative value of the currencies all else being equal a falling loonie causes the canadian listed stock to perform better or in this case less badly in canadian dollars than its u s listed counterpart in u s dollars while a rising loonie has the opposite effect but the shares themselves are identical and as the above calculations demonstrate the performance difference disappears when both stocks are valued in the same currency so although bip appeared to underperform bip un the interlisted units had virtually identical returns in canadian dollars read more questions and answers on this topic john heinzl do you have a question for globe investor send it our way via this form questions and answers will be edited for length what s up in

in his pique over unfair trade prcsident trump is prone to bewail america s as the piggy bank that everybody wants to steal from critics might dismiss this as just another whiff of trumpian hyperbole but it calls attention to a serious question about the country s fiscal adequacy is there enough in that piggy bank for america to take care of its citizens grow the economy and defend itself the piggy bank analogy captures our concerns not only about trade but also about national security and immigration the bank was full when america was truly great in the trumpian sense this of course was the america that built the mighty war machine that vanquished nazi germany and imperial japan emerging as the world s sole superpower with a moral obligation to help raise the war torn countries back on their feet there were then enough dimes and nickels to fund the marshall plan some 12 billion or more than 100 billion in today s dollars which helped rebuild the european democracies america also set up what the national bureau of economic research called a unique and asymmetrical u s centered network of alliances that required washington to guarantee the safety of multiple allies without requiring the protected parties to make any reciprocal commitments in return these arrangements were complemented by an equally asymmetrical trading system in which america s huge and insatiable market absorbed much of the region s industrial products without reciprocal access for u s products to asia s markets this is how the ever growing u s trade deficits with japan china and other east asian economies got started at some point the piggy bank goes empty but this open handed generosity could not last forever the american fiscal surplus turned into ever growing deficits the emptying of the piggy bank can be blamed equally on republican and democratic administrations that lacked the will and the courage to slow the growth of entitlement programs the trillion dollar wars the two bush presidencies started made the problem worse but so did the obama administration that doubled the fiscal deficit in just eight years long before trump even contemplated a presidential run other voices were sounding a lot like him in the 1990s brent bozell a young conservative activist groused about america making out as the world s social worker kevin kearns a republican recounted how the u s made incredible sacrifices to win the cold war it s time for peace dividends he said i d call on our allies to help us rebuild our economy ross perot the texas billionaire who made a third party bid for the white house in 1992 is best remembered for his warning of a giant sucking sound that the north american free trade agreement nafta could make as american companies closed their plants and poured capital into mexico the establishment paid no heed more than 300 economists of all persuasions including several nobel prize winners signed a petition urging nafta s passage the pact got a larger winning margin in the house than expected 234 200 and a comparable 61 48 vote in the senate the lost american jobs left a big hole in u s treasury accounts it took trump an economic naif to his critics to call attention to the strategic costs of america s 800 billion trade deficit one country exporting more goods to another than it can import from that country of course does not constitute theft per se the matter of unfairness enters only if the trade surplus is obtained by currency manipulation or impediments to exports from the deficit bearing partner what constitutes prima facie theft is the 300 billion or more in intellectual property that the united states has lost to china through patent violations espionage and compulsory technology transfer if a growing trade surplus also contributes to a buildup of foreign exchange reserves as with china that would directly affect the global power balance china has used its reserves 4 trillion at its peak with much of them in u s treasuries to buy influence from infrastructure needy countries the united states a debtor nation with a fiscal deficit pushing 22 trillion can no longer be big daddy to the world and has to husband its resources more judiciously looking at the fiscal implications of our policies even immigration policy has serious fiscal implications the administration wants to halt the flow of asylum seekers on the borders because of its costs to the operations of federal agencies and the communities forced to shelter these border jumpers one inkling of the potential fiscal drain is the 98 million per year price of california gov gavin newsom s health care program for about 90 000 illegally present young adults the same issue of affordability lies behind trump s preference for merit based migration which puts entrepreneurs and skilled professionals at the head of the line they are likely to be productive high earning citizens whose efforts can add to the nation s wealth the current policies favoring migrants sponsored by relatives already in the united states or picked by lottery won t affect the fiscal situation as positively these migrants may pay taxes too but some of their earnings are not spent here and instead passed to relatives left behind guatemalan migrants accounted for the bulk of the 9 3 billion in remittances their native country received in 2018 a positive take from this is that it s one way the united states can help alleviate poverty in central america back to the trade front the stakes are so high that retaliatory tariffs cringe worthy though they might be to chicago school economists could be a justifiable recourse if of limited scope or duration since there is no other way to bring the other party to the negotiating table this is the rationale behind the president s latest deal with mexico trade remedies however can get the country only so far it is widely accepted that technology causes more job losses than unfair trade does the job gains from the 2018 trump tax cuts are encouraging but more corporate and government funded research and development are needed to keep up with the chinese more investments are also in order both the trump administration and the house democrats should be reminded of their commitments to infrastructure renewal before their attention is wholly taken up by 2020 electioneering

bernie sanders wears a ucf cap while addressing supporters at a presidential campaign rally in kissimmee florida by seán kinane wmnf news 10 march 2016 what is democratic socialism on wmnf s midpoint we heard sections of a speech from independent senator bernie sanders who is running for president as a democrat he spoke last wednesday june 12 2019 at george washington university in washington d c we also heard a critique of democratic socialism from florida s senior u s senator marco rubio he released a video on wednesday warning about what he calls the dangers of democratic socialism and how it is incompatible with american values we also took calls and texts from listeners you can hear the full show here watch the speech below are the remarks as prepared for delivery via real clear politics bernie sanders my friends we are in the midst of a defining and pivotal moment for our country and our planet and with so many crises converging upon us simultaneously it is easy for us to become overwhelmed or depressed or to even throw up our hands in resignation but my message to you today is that if there was ever a moment in the history of our country where despair was not an option this is that time if there was ever a moment where we had to effectively analyze the competing political and social forces which define this historical period this is that time if there was ever a moment when we needed to stand up and fight against the forces of oligarchy and authoritarianism this is that time and if there was ever a moment when we needed a new vision to bring our people together in the fight for justice decency and human dignity this is that time in the year 2019 the united states and the rest of the world face two very different political paths on one hand there is a growing movement towards oligarchy and authoritarianism in which a small number of incredibly wealthy and powerful billionaires own and control a significant part of the economy and exert enormous influence over the political life of our country on the other hand in opposition to oligarchy there is a movement of working people and young people who in ever increasing numbers are fighting for justice they are the teachers taking to the streets to make certain that schools are adequately funded and that their students get a quality education they are workers at disney amazon walmart and the fast food industry standing up and fighting for a living wage of at least 15 an hour and the right to have a union they are young people taking on the fossil fuel industry and demanding policies that transform our energy system and protect our planet from the ravages of climate change they are women who refuse to give control of their bodies to local state and federal politicians they are people of color and their allies demanding an end to systemic racism and massive racial inequities that exist throughout our society they are immigrants and their allies fighting to end the demonization of undocumented people and for comprehensive immigration reform when we talk about oligarchy let us be clear about what we mean right now in the united states of america three families control more wealth than the bottom half of our country some 160 million americans the top 1 own more wealth than the bottom 92 and 49 of all new income generated today goes to the top 1 in fact income and wealth inequality today in the united states is greater than at any time since the 1920s and when we talk about oligarchy it is not just that the very rich are getting much richer it is that tens of millions of working class people in the wealthiest country on earth are suffering under incredible economic hardship desperately trying to survive today nearly 40 million americans live in poverty and tonight 500 000 people will be sleeping out on the streets about half of the country lives paycheck to paycheck as tens of millions of our people are an accident a divorce a sickness or a layoff away from economic devastation while many public schools throughout the country lack the resources to adequately educate our young people we are the most heavily incarcerated nation on earth after decades of policies that have encouraged and subsidized unbridled corporate greed we now have an economy that is fundamentally broken and grotesquely unfair even while macroeconomic numbers like gdp the stock market and the unemployment rate are strong millions of middle class and working people struggle to keep their heads above water while the billionaire class consumes the lion s share of the wealth that we are collectively creating as a nation in the midst of a so called booming economy real wages for the average worker have barely risen at all and despite an explosion in technology and worker productivity the average wage of the american worker in real dollars is no higher than it was 46 years ago and millions of people are forced to work two or three jobs just to survive and here is something quite incredible that tells you all you need to know about the results of unfettered capitalism all of us want to live long happy and productive lives but in america today the very rich live on average 15 years longer than the poorest americans in 2014 in mcdowell county west virginia one of the poorest counties in the nation life expectancy for men was 64 years in fairfax county virginia a wealthy county just 350 miles away life expectancy for men was nearly 82 years an 18 year differential the life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years in other words the issue of unfettered capitalism is not just an academic debate poverty economic distress and despair are life threatening issues for millions of working people in the country while the rich get richer they live longer lives while poor and working families struggle economically and often lack adequate health care their life expectancy is declining for the first time in modern american history taken together the american dream of upward mobility is in peril in fact if we don t turn things around our younger generation will for the first time in living memory have a lower standard of living than their parents this is not acceptable globally the situation is even more shocking with most of the world s wealth concentrated among a very few while billions of people have almost nothing today the world s richest 26 billionaires now own as much wealth as the poorest 3 8 billion people on the planet half of the world s population but the struggle we are facing today is not just economic across the globe the movement toward oligarchy runs parallel to the growth of authoritarian regimes like putin in russia xi in china mohamed bin salman in saudi arabia rodrigo duterte in the philippines jair bolsonaro in brazil and viktor orbán in hungry among others these leaders meld corporatist economics with xenophobia and authoritarianism they redirect popular anger about inequality and declining economic conditions into violent rage against minorities whether they are immigrants racial minorities religious minorities or the lgbt community and to suppress dissent they are cracking down on democracy and human rights in the united states of course we have our own version of this movement which is being led by president trump and many of his republican allies who are attempting to divide our country up and attack these same communities how sad it is that president trump sees these authoritarian leaders as friends and allies this authoritarian playbook is not new the challenge we confront today as a nation and as a world is in many ways not different from the one we faced a little less than a century ago during and after the great depression in the 1930s then as now deeply rooted and seemingly intractable economic and social disparities led to the rise of right wing nationalist forces all over the world in europe the anger and despair was ultimately harnessed by authoritarian demagogues who fused corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia into a political movement that amassed totalitarian power destroyed democracy and ultimately murdering millions of people including members of my own family but we must remember that those were not the only places where dark forces tried to rise up today we are all rightly repulsed by the sight of neo nazis and klansmen openly marching in charlottesville va and we are horrified by houses of worship being shot up by right wing terrorists but on february 20 1939 over 20 000 nazis held a mass rally not in berlin not in rome but in madison square garden in front of a 30 foot tall banner of george washington bordered with swastikas in new york city but back then those american extremists could not replicate the success of their authoritarian brethren across the ocean because we in the united states thankfully made a different choice than europe did in responding to the era s social and economic crises we rejected the ideology of mussolini and hitler we instead embraced the bold and visionary leadership of president franklin delano roosevelt then the leader of the progressive wing of the democratic party together with organized labor leaders in the african american community and progressives inside and outside the party roosevelt led a transformation of the american government and the american economy like today the quest for transformative change was opposed by big business wall street the political establishment by the republican party and by the conservative wing of fdr s own democratic party and he faced the same scare tactics then that we experience today red baiting xenophobia racism and anti semitism in a famous 1936 campaign speech roosevelt stated we had to struggle with the old enemies of peace business and financial monopoly speculation reckless banking class antagonism sectionalism war profiteering they had begun to consider the government of the united states as a mere appendage to their own affairs we know now that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today they are unanimous in their hate for me and i welcome their hatred despite that opposition by rallying the american people fdr and his progressive coalition created the new deal won four terms and created an economy that worked for all and not just the few today new deal initiatives like social security unemployment compensation the right to form a union the minimum wage protection for farmers regulation of wall street and massive infrastructure improvements are considered pillars of american society but while he stood up for the working families of our country we can never forget that president roosevelt was reviled by the oligarchs of his time who berated these extremely popular programs as socialism similarly in the 1960s when lyndon johnson brought about medicare medicaid and other extremely popular programs he was also viciously attacked by the ruling class of this country and here is the point it is no exaggeration to state that not only did fdr s agenda improve the lives of millions of americans but the new deal was enormously popular politically and helped defeat far right extremism for a time today america and the world are once again moving towards authoritarianism and the same right wing forces of oligarchy corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia are on the march pushing us to make the apocalyptically wrong choice that europe made in the last century today we now see a handful of billionaires with unprecedented wealth and power we see huge private monopolies operating outside of any real democratic oversight and often subsidized by taxpayers with the power to control almost every aspect of our lives they are the profit taking gatekeepers of our health care our technology our finance system our food supply and almost all of the other basic necessities of life they are wall street the insurance companies the drug companies the fossil fuel industry the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex and giant agri businesses they are the entities with unlimited wealth who surround our nation s capitol with thousands of well paid lobbyists who to a significant degree write the laws that we live under today we have a demagogue in the white house who for cheap political gain is attempting to deflect the attention of the american people away from the real crises that we face and instead is doing what demagogues always do and that is divide people up and legislate hatred this is a president who supports brutal family separations border walls muslim bans anti lgbt policies deportations and voter suppression it is my very strong belief that the united states must reject that path of hatred and divisiveness and instead find the moral conviction to choose a different path a higher path a path of compassion justice and love it is the path that i call democratic socialism over eighty years ago franklin delano roosevelt helped create a government that made transformative progress in protecting the needs of working families today in the second decade of the 21st century we must take up the unfinished business of the new deal and carry it to completion this is the unfinished business of the democratic party and the vision we must accomplish in order to accomplish that goal it means committing ourselves to protecting political rights to protecting civil rights and to protect economic rights of all people in this country as fdr stated in his 1944 state of the union address we have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence today our bill of rights guarantees the american people a number of important constitutionally protected political rights and while we understand that these rights have not always been respected and we have so much more work to do we are proud that our constitution guarantees freedom of religion freedom of expression freedom of assembly a free press and other rights because we understand that we can never have true american freedom unless we are free from authoritarian tyranny now we must take the next step forward and guarantee every man woman and child in our country basic economic rights the right to quality health care the right to as much education as one needs to succeed in our society the right to a good job that pays a living wage the right to affordable housing the right to a secure retirement and the right to live in a clean environment we must recognize that in the 21st century in the wealthiest country in the history of the world economic rights are human rights that is what i mean by democratic socialism as dr martin luther king jr said call it democracy or call it democratic socialism but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all of god s children to realize this vision we must not view america only as a population of disconnected individuals we must also view ourselves as part of an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny as dr king put it in other words we are in this together we must see ourselves as part of one nation one community and one society regardless of race gender religion sexual orientation or country of origin this quintessentially american idea is literally emblazoned on our coins e pluribus unum from the many one and i should tell you it is enshrined in the motto of our campaign for the presidency not me us let me be clear i do understand that i and other progressives will face massive attacks from those who attempt to use the word socialism as a slur but i should also tell you that i have faced and overcome these attacks for decades and i am not the only one let us remember that in 1932 republican president herbert hoover claimed that franklin roosevelt s new deal was a disguise for the totalitarian state in 1936 former democratic new york governor and presidential candidate al smith said in a speech about fdr s new deal policies just get the platform of the democratic party and get the platform of the socialist party and lay them down on your dining room table side by side when president harry truman proposed a national health care program the american medical association hired ronald reagan as their pitchman the ama called the legislation that stemmed from his proposal socialized medicine claiming that white house staff were followers of the moscow party line in 1960 ronald reagan in a letter to richard nixon wrote the following about john f kennedy under the tousled boyish haircut is still old karl marx in the 1990s then congressman newt gingrich claimed president bill clinton s health care plan was centralized bureaucratic socialism the conservative heritage foundation has claimed that the children s health insurance program chip was a step towards socialism former speaker of the house john boehner claimed the stimulus package the omnibus spending bill and the budget proposed by president barack obama were all one big down payment on a new american socialist experiment in this regard president harry truman was right when he said that socialism is the epithet they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years socialism is what they called social security socialism is what they called farm price supports socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people now let s be clear while president trump and his fellow oligarchs attack us for our support of democratic socialism they don t really oppose all forms of socialism they may hate democratic socialism because it benefits working people but they absolutely love corporate socialism that enriches trump and other billionaires let us never forget the unbelievable hypocrisy of wall street the high priests of unfettered capitalism in 2008 after their greed recklessness and illegal behavior created the worst financial disaster since the great depression with millions of americans losing their jobs their homes and their life savings wall street s religious adherence to unfettered capitalism suddenly came to an end overnight wall street became big government socialists and begged for the largest federal bailout in american history some 700 billion from the treasury and trillions in support from the federal reserve but it s not just wall street that loves socialism when it works for them it is the norm across the entire corporate world the truth is corporate america receives hundreds of billions of dollars in federal support every single year while these same people are trying to cut programs that benefit ordinary americans if you are a fossil fuel company whose carbon emissions are destroying the planet you get billions in government subsidies including special tax breaks royalty relief funding for research and development and numerous tax loopholes if you are a pharmaceutical company you make huge profits on patent rights for medicines that were developed with taxpayer funded research if you are a monopoly like amazon owned by the wealthiest person in america you get hundreds of millions of dollars in economic incentives from taxpayers to build warehouses and you end up paying not one penny in federal income taxes if you are the walton family the wealthiest family in america you get massive government subsidies because your low wage workers are forced to rely on food stamps medicaid and public housing in order to survive all paid for by taxpayers if you are the trump family you got 885 million worth of tax breaks and subsidies for your family s housing empire that is built on racial discrimination when trump screams socialism all of his hypocrisy will not be lost on the american people americans will know that he is attacking all that we take for granted from social security to medicare to veterans health care to roads and bridges to public schools to national parks to clean water and clean air when trump attacks socialism i am reminded of what dr martin luther king jr said this country has socialism for the rich rugged individualism for the poor and that is the difference between donald trump and me he believes in corporate socialism for the rich and powerful i believe in a democratic socialism that works for the working families of this country what i believe is that the american people deserve freedom true freedom freedom is an often used word but it s time we took a hard look at what that word actually means ask yourself what does it actually mean to be free are you truly free if you are unable to go to a doctor when you are sick or face financial bankruptcy when you leave the hospital are you truly free if you cannot afford the prescription drug you need to stay alive are you truly free when you spend half of your limited income on housing and are forced to borrow money from a payday lender at 200 interest rates are you truly free if you are 70 years old and forced to work because you lack a pension or enough money to retire are you truly free if you are unable to go to attend college or a trade school because your family lacks the income are you truly free if you are forced to work 60 or 80 hours a week because you can t find a job that pays a living wage are you truly free if you are a mother or father with a new born baby but you are forced to go back to work immediately after the birth because you lack paid family leave are you truly free if you are a small business owner or family farmer who is driven out by the monopolistic practices of big business are you truly free if you are a veteran who put your life on the line to defend this country and now sleep out on the streets to me the answer to those questions in the wealthiest nation on earth is no you are not free while the bill of rights protects us from the tyranny of an oppressive government many in the establishment would like the american people to submit to the tyranny of oligarchs multinational corporations wall street banks and billionaires it is time for the american people to stand up and fight for their right to freedom human dignity and security this is the core of what my politics is all about in 1944 fdr proposed an economic bill of rights but died a year later and was never able to fulfil that vision our job 75 years later is to complete what roosevelt started that is why today i am proposing a 21st century economic bill of rights a bill of rights that establishes once and for all that every american regardless of his or her income in entitled to the right to a decent job that pays a living wage the right to quality health care the right to a complete education the right to affordable housing the right to a clean environment the right to a secure retirement over the course of this election my campaign has been releasing and will continue to release detailed proposals addressing each of these yet to be realized economic rights we will also address the attacks that are being launched each day against the civil rights and civil liberties of our people and let me be absolutely clear democratic socialism to me requires achieving political and economic freedom in every community and let me also be clear the only way we achieve these goals is through a political revolution where millions of people get involved in the political process and reclaim our democracy by having the courage to take on the powerful corporate interests whose greed is destroying the social and economic fabric of our country at the end of the day the one percent may have enormous wealth and power but they are just the one percent when the 99 percent stand together we can transform society these are my values and that is why i call myself a democratic socialist at its core is a deep and abiding faith in the american people to peacefully and democratically enact the transformative change that will create shared prosperity social equality and true freedom for all

hrh crown prince mohammed bin salman bin abdulaziz to asharq al awsat we don t want war but we won t hesitate in dealing with any threat saudi press agency sunday 1440 10 13 2019 06 16 jeddah june 16 2019 spa his royal highness prince mohammed bin salman bin abdulaziz crown prince deputy prime minister and minister of defense said that saudi arabia does not want a war in the region but stressed that it will not hesitate in dealing with any threat against our people sovereignty and vital interests in an interview with asharq al awsat the crown prince said that the kingdom supported the re imposition of us sanctions on iran out of our belief that the international community needed to take a decisive stance against iran he hoped that the iranian regime would opt to become a normal state and cease its malign behavior the crown prince told asharq al awsat that the attacks on oil tankers in the gulf oil facilities in the kingdom and abha airport underscore the importance of our demands for the international community to take a decisive stance against an expansionist regime that has supported terrorism and spread death and destruction over the past decades not only in the region but the whole world he criticized iran for using the nuclear deal s economic benefits to support its hostile activities in the region through its tools of chaos and destruction while stressing that the kingdom s hand is always extended for peace he said that the iranian regime did not respect the japanese prime minister as a guest in iran during his visit and in effect responded to his efforts by attacking the two oil tankers in the gulf one of which was apparently japanese it also employed its militias to carry out a heinous attack against abha airport this is clear evidence of the iranian regime s policy and intentions to target the security and stability of the region the crown prince said that saudi arabia places great importance on the strategic ties with the us considering it a main factor in achieving regional security and stability he also expressed confidence that our strategic relations with the us will not be affected by media campaigns or arbitrary stances the kingdom constantly seeks to clarify facts and misconceptions by some parties in the us and other countries we listen to various views and we welcome constructive and rational advice but ultimately our priority is our national interest he said saudi arabia backed all efforts to reach a political solution to the yemeni crisis but the houthi militias prioritize iran s agenda over the interests of yemen and its people the kingdom cannot accept the presence of militias operating outside the apparatus of states on our borders he said adding we not only seek to liberate yemen from the iranian militias but achieve prosperity and stability for all of the people of yemen the crown prince said in the interview that his country is greatly concerned with the security and stability of sudan not only due to the strategic importance of its location and danger of the collapse of its state institutions but also the strong brotherly ties that bind us he pledged to continue to support our brothers in all fields until sudan achieves what it deserves in prosperity and progress on the syrian crisis he said riyadh is working with its allies to achieve its objectives including defeating isis preventing the re emergence of terrorist organizations dealing with the destabilizing iranian influence in syria and using all possible means to achieve political transition in line with resolution 2254 in a manner that preserves syria s unity the crown prince described the murder of saudi citizen jamal khashoggi as a very painful crime the kingdom is seeking to achieve full justice and accountability without getting distracted by positions taken by some for their own domestic considerations that are known to everyone he said any party seeking to politically exploit the case must cease doing so and present whatever evidence it has to the courts in the kingdom to help achieve justice he also pledged to continue to forge forward in our unwavering approach in confronting all forms of extremism and sectarianism and the policies that support them we will not waste our time in offering partial solutions to extremism as history has proven the futility of such efforts said the crown prince on the economy he expressed commitment to the initial public offering of saudi aramco given it is under the appropriate circumstances and in a timely manner but said setting the location of the ipo now is premature and he noted the completion of several preliminary measures in preparation for the offering he said that saudi vision 2030 has moved from planning and design to implementation on all levels and started finding results what is happening in the kingdom is not simply a set of financial and economic reforms aiming to realize specific figures but a comprehensive restructuring of the kingdom s economy aimed at transforming economic and development performance in the medium and long terms we are now shifting from a rentier economy to one that is characterized by productivity and global competitiveness he said he expressed that vision 2030 and its programs like all strategic plans have to be reviewed and updated according to circumstances that may arise during implementation without compromising its foundation or objectives i am proud that saudi citizens are driving change at a time many feared the vision will face resistance due to the size of the change it entails he added here is the full text of the interview the region has recently witnessed dangerous developments that threaten the security and stability of the region and world what is saudi arabia s stance towards these developments and how does the kingdom deal with this escalation saudi arabia s stance is clear as stipulated in its official statements it does not want a war in the region but we will not hesitate in dealing with any threat against our people sovereignty and vital interests our priority is our national interest and achieving the aspirations of our people through the economic and social goals of the kingdom s vision 2030 and through development and economic and social reform this demands a stable and enabling environment within the kingdom and region this is why you will find that the role of the kingdom whether in the arabian gulf north africa horn of africa or other regions is supporting stability and peace this is a policy that the kingdom has adopted since its establishment whereby it has always sought to shun division sectarianism and extremism and instead preserve unity and stability in the region and international peace the kingdom also plays an important role in the international community through its efforts to ensure that oil supplies pass through vital routes that surround it with the aim of protecting the stability of the global economy the world witnessed how we dealt with the iranian tanker in the red sea it was handled based on what our morals and principles and what international treaties and norms demand in return we see how the iranian regime and its proxies have carried out sabotage operations against four oil tankers near fujairah port two of the tankers were saudi this confirms the approach followed by this regime in the region and entire world plenty of evidence supports this and which has accumulated over many years we must not forget that this regime had openly declared since 1979 that its priority and main goal is to export the revolution it seeks to achieve this at the expense of the aspirations of its people and the peoples of the region this explains the behavior of the iranian regime the export of the revolution and wilayat al faqih principle demand the destabilization of countries and the region stoking sectarianism spreading extremism and dedicating the resources of the iranian people towards financing and arming terrorist militias despite this the kingdom has constantly extended its hand for peace with iran to avoid the horrors of wars and destruction on the region and its people saudi arabia even supported the nuclear deal with iran because the kingdom has throughout history never spared an effort to resolve any crisis through diplomatic and peaceful means we had hoped that the iranian regime would have taken advantage of this initiative to change its behavior towards the countries in the region and see it as a first step towards iran s return to the international community as a normal state unfortunately iran misused the economic benefits of this deal to support its hostile acts in the region it continued to violate international resolutions it was better off dedicating the economic benefits in improving the lives of the iranian people developing infrastructure and achieving economic development instead of continuing its destructive behavior in the region iran s recklessness has reached unprecedented levels after the nuclear pact the iranian revolutionary guards corps budget increased and it intensified its support for sectarian militias in the region and even the whole world we have all seen how terrorist and hostile iranian operations were recently thwarted in europe this is why the kingdom supported the re imposition of us sanctions on iran it did so out of our belief that the international community needed to take a decisive stance against iran it must also take the necessary measures to limit the regime s ability to spread chaos and destruction in the whole world recent developments in the region including the targeting of aramco oil pumping stations by the iran backed houthi militias underscores the importance of our demand for the international community to take a decisive stance against an expansionist regime that has supported terrorism and spread death and destruction over the past decades not only in the region but the whole world the choice is clear before iran does it want to be a normal country that plays a constructive role in the international community or does it want to be a rogue state we hope that the iranian regime would opt to become a normal country and cease its malign behavior you have pointed to the american stance on iran which coincides with the saudi stance as is the case with the majority of strategic issues recent months have however seen criticism directed at the kingdom from within the united states over a number of issues especially the jamal khashoggi case has this criticism affected the strategic cooperation between the two countries the kingdom places great importance on the strategic ties with the us they are relations that extend to more than 70 years during which this strategic partnership has defeated several challenges that have targeted the security stability and sovereignty of our countries our ties with the us are important and pivotal not only for achieving joint interests whether economic on the security level or others but they are a main factor in achieving regional security and stability together with the us and in cooperation with several countries in the region and world we seek to achieve sustainable stability in the region that would establish the necessary environment to meet the aspirations of its people to live in dignity and real development we do so by confronting the forces of chaos destruction and instability embodied in terrorist organizations and their state sponsors starting with the iranian regime and confronting all forms of extremism as for media campaigns or some stances in the us they certainly do not serve the joint interests of our countries throughout the kingdom s history however we have previously faced such campaigns that are often biased and not based on accurate information we constantly seek to clarify facts and misconceptions by some parties in the us and other countries we listen to various views and we welcome constructive and rational advise but ultimately our priority is our national interest our priority is the citizen in riyadh jeddah jazan tabuk dammam and other regions in the kingdom not the beliefs or views of others about the kingdom throughout the kingdom s history we have managed to work with our main allies despite natural differences that exist between all countries by respecting the sovereignty of nations and avoiding meddling in their internal affairs we expect nothing less than reciprocal treatment when it comes to our sovereignty and internal affairs i am confident that our strategic relations with the us will not be affected by media campaigns or arbitrary stances as for the murder of citizen jamal khashoggi as i have previously said this is a very painful crime that is unprecedented in the history of the kingdom such acts are alien to our culture and contradict our principles and values the kingdom has taken the necessary measures whether through the judiciary to hold the perpetrators to account or through taking procedural measures to prevent such unfortunate crimes from taking place again in the future these measures stem first and foremost from the importance we place in the kingdom on the lives of every saudi citizen irrespective of their views these measures have not and will not be affected by any other factors we are a state governed by the rule of law and it is unacceptable for the life of a citizen to be violated in such a painful way under any circumstance unfortunately the suspects are government employees and we seek to achieve full justice any party seeking to politically exploit the case must cease doing so and present whatever evidence it has to the courts in the kingdom to help achieve justice does the agreement with the us on iran apply to the situation in syria especially in wake of the american decision to withdraw from the country we are in agreement on the objectives in syria which are the defeat of the isis preventing the re emergence of terrorist organizations dealing with the destabilizing iranian influence in syria and using all possible means to achieve political transition according to resolution 2254 in a manner that preserves syria s unity we are working with friendly countries to achieve these goals how do you interpret the japanese prime minister s recent visit to iran and his meeting with the supreme leader we thank the japanese prime minister for his good intentions and the kingdom s hand is always extended for peace to achieve security and stability of the region the iranian regime however did not respect the japanese prime minister as a guest in iran during his visit and in effect responded to his efforts by attacking the two oil tankers in the gulf one of which was apparently japanese it also employed its militias to carry out a heinous attack against abha airport this is clear evidence of the iranian regime s policy and intentions to target the security and stability of the region iran is the party that is constantly escalating tensions in the region it carries out terrorist attacks and immoral acts of aggression directly or through its militias the problem lies in tehran not anywhere else as i have previously stated iran must choose between becoming a normal country that plays a constructive role in the international community or remain a rogue state and assume the international consequences of its choice the turkish president and other turkish officials have recently escalated their rhetoric in questioning the credibility of the kingdom s judiciary and held the kingdom and its leadership responsible in khashoggi s case how do you respond to such accusations jamal khashoggi is a saudi citizen and there is no doubt that what happened to him was painful and unfortunate the kingdom has taken all measures to hold the perpetrators accountable and the accused have been referred to the judiciary the judiciary in the kingdom is an independent authority and no one can meddle in its affairs we confront any development firmly and without hesitation by taking the steps that are necessary to achieve justice rectify any flaw and prevent mistakes from taking place again while disregarding any claims and accusations as for the statements by some turkish officials towards the kingdom the kingdom as the home of the two holy mosques seeks strong ties with all islamic countries including turkey this is important for the interest of the region and joint islamic work in particular in the kingdom we work in service of the holy mosques and their visitors we work on achieving the security and stability of our nation not becoming embroiled in disputes that harm the interests of our nation and islamic world we will forge forward in achieving these goals without getting distracted by positions taken by some for their own domestic considerations that are known to everyone four years have passed since the arab coalition kicked off its operations in yemen how do you assess the political and military progress that has been achieved and what are the prospects for resolving the crisis in yemen especially in wake of the stockholm deal and terrorist houthi attacks on saudi oil pumping stations and its najran and abha airports many parties forget or claim to forget how the crisis in yemen first broke out the coalition operations began after the international community had exhausted all political solutions between yemeni parties and the houthi militias one must be reminded that the kingdom is the pioneer of the political solution it presented the gcc initiative and worked on achieving peaceful political transition in yemen in 2011 it supported the national dialogue and presented over 7 billion dollars in economic support for yemen between 2012 and 2014 since 2011 the kingdom s efforts have sought to achieve smooth political transition in a manner that preserves the country s independence and sovereignty and unity of its political and security institutions to prevent it from slipping into chaos indeed the yemeni parties met in riyadh and signed the gcc initiative and its implementation mechanism all yemeni parties including the houthis were present at the comprehensive national dialogue unfortunately iran obstructed the political process in yemen through its proxy houthi militias which started to occupy yemeni cities and seize the state s various resources and capabilities the kingdom offered all possible opportunities to resolve the situation through peaceful means but iran was following a policy of imposing a new reality in arab countries by force of arms unfortunately the international community at the time did not confront iran s expansionist and sectarian agenda iran therefore continued to try through its militias to impose its control in yemen the yemeni people and leadership however made a historic stand against this iranian interference along with our brothers in the coalition we responded immediately to the appeal of the legitimate government to protect yemen and its people and our national security the kingdom cannot accept the presence of militias operating outside the apparatus of states on our borders most yemeni territories have been liberated and we have supported all efforts to reach a political solution to the crisis unfortunately the houthi militias prioritize iran s agenda over the interests of yemen and its people we have recently witnessed the terrorist attack on oil facilities and najran airport which the houthis boasted of claiming this once again demonstrates that these militias do not care for the interests of the yemeni people or any political process to resolve the crisis their actions reflect the priorities of tehran not sanaa the arab coalition s stance is very clear about resolving the crisis we support efforts to reach a political solution based on un security council resolution 2216 the gcc initiative and its implementation mechanism and national dialogue outcomes we accept the participation of all yemeni parties in the political process but according to the three references the kingdom will not accept the militias to remain outside state control we will pursue this ultimate goal and maintain our operations and continue on offering support to the yemeni people in their effort to protect their independence and sovereignty despite our sacrifice the kingdom will also maintain its humanitarian and economic relief in yemen we not only seek to liberate yemen from the iranian militias but achieve prosperity and stability for all of the people of yemen you have spoken of a dream to transform the middle east into the new europe how do you confront obstacles in reaching this dream given the major regional political upheaval and economic and development challenges we must not become hostages of temporary conditions that prevent us from fulfilling our primary duty as leaders in the region of reviving our states today s challenges must also not prevent us from working promptly to achieve a better future for the coming generations you mentioned political upheaval this is undoubtedly taking place in the region at the same time however we must look at the overall arab region and realize that the majority of the countries are unanimous in prioritizing a dignified life for the people and achieving security and stability the people do not want to be hostages to ideological conflicts that waste their potential we are before a precedent in that everyone shares one goal competition between the majority of our countries focuses on reaching the best standard of living for the people attracting investment and achieving development in all fields the source of political upheaval is well known they are terrorist groups such as isis al qaeda the muslim brotherhood and policies of the iranian regime the top sponsor of terrorism and extremism we will not waste our time in offering partial solutions to extremism as history has proven the futility of such efforts god willing we will continue to forge forward in our unwavering approach in confronting all forms of extremism and sectarianism and the policies that support them the kingdom is the home of the two holy mosques it has been blessed with natural resources a strategic location and wise leadership since the days of its founder and until the present reign of the custodian of the two holy mosques it is also blessed with its great and innovative people today it is living in security stability and prosperity it is unbecoming for this great nation not to occupy leading positions in all fields regardless of the conditions and challenges we will not rest until we first achieve this goal for our nation and then our brothers in the region how do you assess the upheaval in sudan and the political changes we are greatly concerned with the security and stability of sudan not only due to the strategic importance of its location and danger of the collapse of its state institutions but also the strong brotherly ties that bind us our brothers and sisters in sudan have been and continue to be a part of our social fabric they have contributed greatly to our progress in all fields we will not spare any effort to achieve the security and stability for sudan and its people the kingdom has taken measures to support the brotherly people of sudan including an economic aid package and depositing 250 million dollars in its central bank we will continue to support our brothers in all fields until sudan achieves the prosperity and progress it deserves three years after launching saudi vision 2030 where are we at we moved from the planning and design phase to implementation on all levels and started seeing results on the ground on developing the financial sector for example we have seen noteworthy progress after the launching of the vision as the saudi market joined three global indices the ftse the morgan stanley msci emerging markets index and s p dow jones indices this will pump capital worth billions into the market the kingdom has seen a 40 increase in investors in investment funds a first since 2006 the kingdom has recently achieved the greatest leap among some of the world s most competitive countries in the imd world competitiveness rankings 2019 ranking 26th moving up 13 ranks compared to last year and ranking 7th among g20 member states in the telecommunications and information sector we witnessed remarkable development the contribution of the digital economy to the gdp increased both directly and indirectly with the kingdom becoming one of the top 10 fastest e commerce growing countries worldwide with a rate of 32 simultaneously internet speeds have improved fourfold to accelerate digital transformation the kingdom was also the first country in the middle east and north africa region to roll out 5g network services back in 2018 in the eastern province for trial today we have 1 000 communication towers in the kingdom that are offering this new service and expanding in the field of energy and industry non oil exports increased by 22 in 2018 compared to 2017 and we launched many industrial cities in different regions across the kingdom this confirms the keenness of the government of the custodian of the two holy mosques to achieve balanced and comprehensive development in various cities and regions including the king salman energy park spark jizan and waad al shamal where the first phase of the production of phosphates and phosphate fertilizers has been achieved laying down the foundation for the second phase which will make the kingdom god willing the second largest producer of phosphate fertilizers globally i would like to note that what is happening in the kingdom is not simply a set of financial and economic reforms aiming to realize specific figures but a comprehensive restructuring of the kingdom s macro economy aimed at improving economic and development performance in the medium and long terms we have undertaken major economic and structural reforms that contribute to fiscal balance and financial control and the diversification of income sources while maintaining a continuing macroeconomic growth sustaining public finances supporting social expenditures raising government spending efficiency and stimulating the private sector which is considered a key partner in growth and development and achieving the vision s objectives but there are claims about setbacks in some of vision 2030 s initiatives what is happening in the kingdom is a comprehensive structural change in the economy aimed at creating a shift in medium and long term economic performance the vision 2030 and its programs like all strategic plans has to be reviewed and updated according to circumstances that may arise during implementation without compromising its foundation or objectives and with the aim of achieving top results especially at a time we have gained a higher quality of decision making based on studies analyses figures facts and data responding to your question about some vision related initiatives that might be in decline we do not expect this the vision s programs are effectively contributing to the economic transformation process and we are now shifting from a rentier economy to one that is characterized by productivity and global competitiveness some may argue that the public investment fund pif is giving the private sector a run for its money with its direct investments and mega projects what role does it play in achieving the vision and how can negative effects be avoided in line with vision 2030 and in order to achieve its objectives it was important to review the role of the pif and transform it into a state sovereign fund in 2015 we re launched pif with a new vision and mission aimed at developing new sectors in saudi arabia investing in leading international partnerships and the formation of a new board of directors under my leadership between 2016 and 2018 the number of staffers increased from 40 to nearly 500 employees meanwhile pif assets have increased from sr500 billion to sr 1 trillion nearly doubling within two years the pif is now a vital state instrument for economic diversification and targets both domestic and international investments domestically it targets major project investments that the private sector alone cannot finance such as neom the red sea project and qiddiya that will offer dozens if not hundreds of good investment opportunities for the private sector for pif and the government it is of utmost importance to involve the private sector we have earmarked 13 programs for privatization giving the private sector a greater opportunity to participate in investment achieve profitable returns and improve spending efficiency and services in terms of foreign investments apart from achieving attractive returns on its assets pif will play an important role in establishing economic partnerships that will help boost knowledge exchange stimulate high efficiency investments and enhance local content generating long term returns for future generations the pif also targets new strategic sectors such as tourism and entertainment these sectors have an important dimension in stimulating foreign investment regional development creating a large number of jobs and improving overall quality of life the pif operates under an outstanding level of corporate governance and transparent investment strategy which were approved after completing its reform and governance process in 2015 it operates within a system that includes a board executive committee and investment committee that play clear roles in guaranteeing distinguished levels of professionalism in performance the pif also has investment portfolios distributed according to development priorities such as in saudi companies promising sectors and major projects what are the latest developments in the privatization program we now have an exceptional and global center specialized in privatization that is built on the best practices drawn from experiences of more than 20 countries that have undertaken privatization in the past when establishing the center it was taken into account that it contains a legal structure ensuring the rights of both the state and investors we have identified promising opportunities for privatization in 12 sectors our goal from the privatization program is for it to strengthen the effectiveness of the role of government and to maximize the contribution of the private sector to gdp in 2019 the national center for privatization ncp supported the signing of five agreements with a total value exceeding sr 12 5 billion inked by local and international companies in various fields and with 70 foreign financing from six countries these agreements include projects that focus on sewage treatment desalination plants and health services through dialysis centers the ncp is currently working on finalizing agreements totaling over sr2 billion and that cover flour mills and medical and shipping services these agreements are expected to be completed by the end of 2019 work is also underway for privatizing education sector projects expected in 2020 with investments adding up to about sr1 billion in the future the private sector will also have the largest investment share in electricity sector projects especially power generation plans and including major renewable energy projects previously announced amidst such economic transformation what is your highness s message to citizens i am proud that saudi citizens are driving change at a time many feared the vision will face resistance due to the size of the change it entails many have told me that the most difficult part i will face in realizing this strategic transformation is resistance but i saw this as a very small factor when looking at saudi youth that is now leading change i would like to pay tribute to the role of young people in the transformation currently taking place in the kingdom it is a young vision with a young spirit discussions have shifted from a change desired from the state to the change we all make together when following news about the anticipated saudi aramco s ipo in global markets we find there is a lack of information about the issue and the timeline where are matters now and what actions have been taken in this regard we are committed to the initial public offering of saudi aramco but under the appropriate circumstances and in a timely manner as i mentioned previously i expect that it will happen between 2020 and the beginning of 2021 and setting the location of the ipo now is premature much of the work has been successfully completed and the timeframe for the offering will depend on several factors including market conditions for the ipo given its size and aramco s acquisition of a majority stake in sabic from pif the latter is a deal which would create a stellar transformation through establishing a fully integrated national energy and petrochemical company that will lead the global energy sector and further enhance saudi aramco s growth potential and profitability in volatile oil markets as for preparations for aramco s ipo several important actions have been taken including the issuance of the hydrocarbon tax system the re issuance of an exclusive franchise agreement the appointment of a new board of directors and the first ever releasing of aramco s annual financial report and audit of its oil reserves all these measures reinforce transparency which is a core principle of saudi vision 2030 which is committed to protecting the kingdom s interests and those of potential investors saudi aramco for its part has also logged several achievements within its internal program in preparation for the ipo one of the most important features of the program was amending internal rules and regulations the transformation into a joint stock company and releasing its financial report meeting requirements of potential financial markets for the ipo this has left investors satisfied worldwide as we have seen through the recent bond offering spa 10 32 local time 07 32 gmt 0010 news letter join the globalsecurity org mailing list enter your email address

the ticker president trump s campaign has reportedly fired three pollsters after internal numbers showing him trailing democratic challengers in key states leaked to the media but there s another set of numbers that should arguably concern the trump reelection effort just as much corporate tax revenue is down 9 percent this year after dropping 31 percent last year politico s brian faler reported friday dragging big business tax collections to their lowest levels in more than a half century those figures open a fresh line of attack for democratic presidential hopefuls they are eager to cast trump s signature domestic achievement the 2017 tax overhaul as a giveaway to the rich while proposing to roll it back to fund pricey policy proposals it isn t entirely clear what s behind the dramatic drop off analysts agree they can t yet explain the decline in corporate tax payments faler writes they have a host of theories though such as businesses making wider than expected use of the law s expanded breaks for business investments it may also be an unexpected side effect of trade wars advertisement nevertheless the phenomenon defies official expectations the congressional budget office projected that after a dip in 2017 collections would rise by 20 percent this year democratic presidential hopefuls aren t concerning themselves with the nuance from former vice president joe biden to sen bernie sanders i vt the critique has been largely the same trump and the gop blew a hole in the budget with a needless giveaway to corporations and the superwealthy thereby denying resources to lower and middle income workers rolling back these toxic trump tax cuts alone to me is important sen cory booker d n j told cnbc s john harwood last week the senator said doing so could help pay for his plan to hand out baby bonds which carries an estimated 2 trillion price tag when you say i can t pay for it just by rolling back the trump tax cuts i can tell you from the estate tax to the trump tax cuts i could give you the math on how we re going to do this biden for his part has said repealing trump s tax cuts would be his first priority in office this month he unveiled a plan to pump 1 7 trillion into clean energy research and infrastructure overhauls funded in party by rolling back the cuts while the former veep wasn t specific about how he d change the code biden s campaign said he would pay for the program by reversing the excesses of the trump tax cuts for corporations reducing incentives for tax havens evasion and outsourcing ensuring corporations pay their fair share closing other loopholes in our tax code that reward work not wealth and ending subsidies for fossil fuels biden also singled out amazon last week for paying no federal taxes in 2018 prompting a sharp response from the company and signaling once again that the issue will remain front and center in the campaign advertisement similarly sen kamala harris d calif has said she would fund her proposed 500 monthly tax credit for lower income families a plan projected to cost 2 trillion over a decade by scotching trump s tax cuts on day one we are going to repeal that tax bill that benefited the top 1 and the biggest corporations of america she said this year sen elizabeth warren d mass who has set the pace for the field in rolling out detailed policy pitches proposes to go much further than repealing trump s tax cuts she s advocating a series of new tax hikes concentrated on the wealthy to fund an ambitious array of new programs ms warren would seek big tax increases on the wealthiest individuals and corporations creating a new tax on household assets that exceed 50 million as well as a new tax on corporate profits the new york times s thomas kaplan and jim tankersley wrote last week from those two steps alone she says she would raise at least 3 8 trillion over a decade money that would go toward her plans on student debt cancellation free college child care the opioid crisis and green manufacturing advertisement of course having a plan to pay for a plan isn t the same as having a plan to pass it through a closely and bitterly divided congress in the meantime

risk of bad things has gone up like taking out an insurance policy that s how some analysts characterize the current case for cutting rates and they cite 1995 as the parallel back then the fed lowered rates in time to prevent an economic slowdown from turning into a recession advertisement fed officials are set to consider at their meeting tuesday and wednesday whether a worsening of trade tensions since their april 30 may 1 meeting and the recent slowdown in hiring and industrial activity might warrant similar insurance if not this week then later this summer are markets too optimistic about

reserve policy and u s china trade negotiations the range of options for this week s fed meeting spans a surprise interest rate cut a set up of one down the road or a continued stance of patience given still solid economic growth late next week the outcomes of the group of 20 summit look binary either u s china trade talks get back on track or investors must anticipate further tariff hikes and the usual run of data must be added to the mix such as the july 5 payroll report yet despite the potential for major market moves from these events jpmorgan chase co strategists estimate that the embedded volatility risk premium is significantly below its historical average advertisement bond strategists warn the fed may not act quickly bloomberg s liz mccormick strategists at charles schwab td securities and ubs are among those saying traders may be wrong to only factor in negative trade outcomes that would warrant an imminent reduction in borrowing costs many fed watchers say the economic headwinds are enough for the central bank to retire its mantra of being patient on policy yet for the three firms above committing to cuts would be premature before this month s group of 20 summit where a resolution of the tariff standoff remains a possibility goldman sachs economists are also skeptical in a note this weekend the bank s economists argue cuts aren t necessarily coming this year one key assumption behind the insurance story is that policymakers can reverse the cuts once the risk abates indeed the greenspan fed moved rates back up soon after the 1995 96 and 1998 cuts in march 1997 and june 1999 respectively however the greater political scrutiny of fed hikes now especially with a presidential election approaching could make this harder to do in 2020 so that overly hasty insurance cuts now might increase the risk that the funds rate gets stuck at too low a level if the economy remains resilient trump tracker trade fly around new china tariffs advance with ustr

markets are bracing for updates on tactical trade war positioning and central bank rate decisions the dollar s recent rally stemmed on better than expected economic data that could convince fed officials that the economy is healthy enough and might not require an immediate rate cut us stocks are struggling resuming the recent rebound until we see further progress on the trade front and a confirmation that the fed will deliver a rate cut on monday we will see if china is dumping us treasuries and public hearings begin in washington on president trump s proposed tariffs on 300 billion more in chinese goods the focus for the trading week will fall on the upcoming rate decisions from the fed boj and boe which should further cement easing money flowing through financial markets the fed will meet on wednesday and is expected to pave the way for july rate cut by downgrading their forecasts and removing their patient stance the boj is not expected to announce anything new but possibly highlight the growing of the risks to the downside on both their growth and inflation forecasts the boe is expected to remain on hold until further clarity is delivered on brexit the outlook

expected appears set to signal to markets that a rate cut is coming at the july meeting fed fund futures see a 21 3 chance that rates will be cut at the june 19th meeting while the july 31st meeting has an 84 3 expectation for a rate cut the fed is widely expected to tweak their stance on being patient which would signal they are ready to ease historically the dollar weakness is strongest at the beginning of an easing cycle and the swiss franc has been the strongest beneficiary if we see the fed signal a one and done approach to easing we however could see limited dollar weakness the fed owes the market a rate cut to fix the policy mistake at the end of last year and they should keep the door open for further easing to deliver a soft landing for the us economy gbp the bank of england is expected to keep rates steady as policymakers will unlikely be able to deliver any clear messages on future policy until we have brexit clarity while the recent banter has been calling for rate hikes boe officials will struggle to deliver a rate hike as economic growth has softened and despite inflation running above target brexit remains the key driver for the british pound and expectations are

over the past week a team of experts from the international monetary fund imf has been working the clock to help the george weah led government resuscitate the struggling liberian economy the team last friday met with the both houses standing committees on budget ways means and finance multiple sources confirmed to frontpageafrica that the meeting was intended to generate support and encourage members of the legislative branch of government to buy into the reform process currently being formulated to help restore sanity to the liberian economy the crux of the of the meeting sources tell frontpageafrica is to focus on wage bill reform which will see a harmonization of salaries across ministries and agencies of government the mission fpa has learned has told liberian authorities that in order to have an effective wage bill reform the legislature must support the process by also taking a hit as well for the reform to be effective all branches of government must commit to taking a cut in their salaries and other wages the mission noted during the recent spring meetings in washington dc the government of liberia committed to imf supported program which among other things calls for austerity measures in addressing rising inflation unemployment level and depreciation of the liberian dollar and fall in global commodity prices the imf team noted that these economic down turn was no fault of the weah administration the imf believes that a credible budget will enable monetary policy to operate and help bring down inflation and rising prices addressing the revenue and expenditure gaps will also require a new approach in soes contribution to the resource pot state owned enterprises are operating in a way that does not provide a definitive contribution towards budgetary support soes are also noted for determining their own expenditure including salaries and other benefits which is way above other ministries and agencies of government extended assistance to liberia s gdp in the past years was one of the highest but it has slimmed down the aid was paying for both capital revenue and wage including goods and services the net flow of foreign exchange has also reduced something that started around 2016 due to unmil departure the slumped in natural resources the imf informed the house s committee that a recent household income expenditure survey shows that the poorest earn and buy in liberian dollar and that they have lost about 30 of their purchasing power it is important for members of both houses of the legislature to being exploring avenues and working toward finding loopholes in their budget to enable the wage reform process to proceed smoothly the latest article iv consultation report from the imf is clear the near and medium term outlook under the baseline scenario remains challenging growth is projected to slow further to about 0 4 percent in 2019 and remain below 2 percent into the medium term the released this week noted in the baseline scenario the authorities face the possibility of a forced abrupt adjustment when domestic and external financing options are exhausted an alternative reform scenario is therefore presented as a more viable alternative in which growth weakens somewhat in the near term due to proactive fiscal and monetary tightening but picks up significantly over the medium term to exceed 5 percent by 2024 the imf directors have emphasized that significant fiscal adjustment is needed going forward in its latest article iv report the imf directors underscore that efforts should focus on mobilizing domestic revenue and rationalizing spending especially the wage bill while securing needed space for social and capital spending directors encouraged the authorities to formulate realistic budgets and to implement a sound borrowing plan that ensures debt sustainability while advocating caution in engaging in non concessional borrowing they also called for further progress in public financial management reforms to improve the quality of spending in a resource constrained environment the imf agreed that the central bank of liberia cbl should tighten monetary policy with the objective of reducing inflation to single digits by 2021 directors emphasized that further issuance of cbl bills should be suspended until the cost of the operation is included in the government budget and the fiscal financing gap is closed without cbl financing and noted that while the financial soundness indicators show that the banking sector appears adequately capitalized the cbl should enhance its supervisory efforts the imf highlighted the need to prioritize strengthening the cbl s supervisory regulatory and resolution frameworks in light of the elevated level of nonperforming loans focusing on measures that improve loan underwriting standards this is why we feel strongly that liberia must make a strong case for economic support by demonstrating a strong commitment to macroeconomic stability poverty reduction and growth as swell as reduction in the depreciation of the liberian dollar through the extended credit facility which supports a country s balance of payment deficit will help reduce the level of vulnerability and economic stress the country is undergoing with a strong commitment and a demonstrated capacity we can go for an imf support for liberia the imf mission noted these measures which are accordingly a medium term framework will require a short term intervention to address some of the prevailing economic realities while these reform measures sound good for the economic health of the country lawmakers believe that there is a need for a one off injection into the economy which will lead to some level of stability the country s is currently paying interest on more than us 1 2 billion loan from the previous government domestic arrears are also inhibiting the private sector from providing goods and services workers are being layoff because of the government inability to service her domestic liabilities the mission could not commit to providing a passage way for a stimulus package that would jumpstart the economy borrowing as an alternative option to jumpstart the economy will plunge the government into further debt during his address to the nation in may the president noted that his government will no longer borrow money from the central bank this pronouncement makes any attempt to borrow complicated while many have argued that the imf has no record of providing the right panacea for developing countries critics still believe that the government of liberia can salvage something good out of this reform process succeeding at restoring sound macroeconomic stability in the coming years will require a collective support from all aisle of government to include the legislative and judicial branches of government

with its official cash rate now expected to fall below 1 to a new extraordinarily low close to zero all sorts of people are saying that the reserve bank is in danger of running out of ammunition ammunition might be needed if as during the last financial crisis it needs to cut rates by several percentage points this view assumes that when the cash rate hits zero there is nothing more the reserve bank can do the view is not only wrong it is also dangerous because if taken seriously it would mean that all of the next rounds of stimulus would have to come from fiscal spending and tax policy even though fiscal policy is probably ineffective long term its effects being neutralised by a floating exchange rate the experience of the united states shows that australia s reserve bank could quite easily take measures that would have the same effect as cutting its cash rate a further 2 5 percentage points that is 2 5 percentage points below zero reserve bank cash rate since 1990 in a report released on tuesday by the university of sydney s united states studies centre i document the successes and failures of the us approach to so called quantitative easing qe between 2009 and 2014 it demonstrates that it is always possible to change the instrument of monetary policy from changes in the official interest rate to changes in other interest rates by buying and holding other financial instruments such as long term government and corporate bonds the more aggressively the reserve bank buys those bonds from private sector owners the lower the long term interest rates that are needed to place bonds and the more former owners whose hands are filled with cash that they have to make use of in the us the federal reserve also used forward guidance about the likely future path of the us federal funds rate to convince markets the rate would be kept low for an extended period it is unclear which mechanism was the most powerful or whether the fed even needed to buy bonds in order to make forward guidance work however in a stressed economic environment it is worth trying both read more the reserve bank will cut rates again and again until we lift spending and push up prices as it comes to be believed that interest rates will stay low for an extended period the exchange rate will fall making it easier for australian corporates to borrow from overseas and to export and compete with imports the consensus of the academic literature is that qe cut long term interest rates by around one percentage point and had economic effects equivalent to cutting the us federal fund rate by a further 2 5 percentage points after it approached zero qe need not have limits based on us estimates australia s reserve bank would need to purchase assets equal to around 1 5 of australia s gross domestic product to achieve the equivalent of a 0 25 percentage point reduction in the official cash rate that s around a 30 billion with over a 780 billion in long term government commonwealth and state securities on issue there s enough to accommodate a very large program of reserve bank buying and the bank could also follow the example of the fed and expand the scope of purchases to include non government securities including residential mortgage backed securities it could also learn from us mistakes the fed was slow to cut its official interest rate to near zero and slow to embark on qe in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis its first attempt was limited in size and duration its success in using qe to stimulate the economy should be viewed as the lower bound of what s possible even if it becomes less effective as it grows it s often suggested although it is by no means certain that monetary policy becomes less effective when interest rates get very low but this isn t necessarily an argument to use monetary policy less it could just as easily be an argument to use it more because there is no in principle limit to how much qe a central bank can do it is always possible to do more and succeed in lifting the inflation rate and spending fiscal policy may well be even less effective to the extent that it succeeds it is likely to push up the australian dollar making australian businesses less competitive us economist scott sumner believes the extra bang for the buck from government spending or tax cuts known as the multiplier is close to zero reserve bank governor philip lowe this month appealed for help from the government itself asking in particular for extra spending on infrastructure and measures to raise productivity growth read more vital signs if we fall into a recession and we might we ll have ourselves to blame he is correct in identifying the contribution other policies can make to driving economic growth no one seriously thinks reserve bank monetary policy can or should substitute for productivity growth but it is a good perhaps a very good substitute for government spending that does not contribute to productivity growth three myths about quantitative easing in the paper i address several myths about qe one is that it is printing money it no more prints money than does conventional monetary policy it pushes money into private sector hands by adjusting interest rates albeit a different set of rates another myth is that it promotes inequality by helping the rich to get richer it is a widely believed myth former coalition treasurer joe hockey told the british institute of economic affairs in 2014 that loose monetary policy actually helps the rich to get richer why because we ve seen rising asset values wealthier people hold the assets but it widens inequality no more than conventional monetary policy and may not widen it at all if it is successful in maintaining sustainable economic growth a third myth is that it leads to excessive inflation or socialism in the us it has in fact been associated with some of the lowest inflation since the second world war these days central banks are more likely to err on the side of creating too little inflation than too much some have argued that qe in the us is to blame for the rise of left wing populists like alexandria ocasio cortez and millennial socialism but it is probably truer to say that their grievances grew out of too tight rather than too loose monetary policy qe has been road tested we ve little to fear from it just as we have had little to fear from conventional monetary policy
when interest rates are low central banks don t have much room to maneuver to deal with a crisis the new york fed president john williams said on wednesday june 6 2019 in addition according to williams if inflation falls central banks will have even less room to maneuver when faced with a slowdown furthermore said williams while i will always be vigilant about inflation that s too high inflation that s too low is now a more pressing problem note that this way of thinking is based on the equation that links nominal and real interest rates on this way of thinking the real interest rate can be approximated as real interest rate nominal interest rate inflation rate or we can say that nominal interest rate real interest rate inflation rate price stability and deflation the popular way of thinking maintains that the policy of price stability does not always imply that the central bank must fight inflation it is also the role of the central bank to prevent large falls in the inflation rate or an outright decline in the general price level why is that so because it is held that a fall in the price level i e deflation postpones consumer and business expenditures thereby paralyzing economic activity moreover a fall in inflation raises real interest rates thereby further weakening the economy additionally as expenditures weaken this further raises unutilized capacity and puts further downward pressure on the price level most economists are of the view that it is much harder for the central bank to handle deflation than inflation when inflation rises the central bank can always cool it off by tighter monetary policies which weakens aggregate demand there is no limit so to speak for the central bank as far as raising interest rates is concerned this is however not so with regard to deflation the lowest level that the central bank can go is the zero interest level for instance let us assume that fed policy makers have reached a conclusion that in order to revive the economy real interest rates must be lowered to a negative figure this however may not be always possible to accomplish so the argument goes when nominal or market interest rates are at a zero level at negative interest rates individuals are going to be reluctant to lend we are aware that some central banks such as the swedish and the european central banks have lowered their policy rates to below zero mark thus in sweden in july 2009 the rate was lowered to minus 0 25 while in the euro zone to minus 0 1 in june 2014 we hold that fed policy makers are going to be reluctant to experiment with negative interest rates given that this could generate market perception that policy makers are panicking for instance when the inflation rate is minus 1 and the nominal interest rate is 0 then the real interest rate following our equation is going to be 1 let us say that central bank policy makers conclude that the real interest rate of minus 0 5 is required to prevent an economic deterioration at an inflation rate of minus 1 this would require the central bank to lower nominal interest rates to minus 1 5 likewise when the inflation rate is very low it can also create problems suppose that inflation has fallen from 2 to 1 at nominal rates at 0 the central bank can only target a real interest rate of minus 1 it cannot aim at a lower real interest rate since this would imply setting the nominal interest rate below zero likewise as the economy weakens further and inflation falls to 0 5 this will not allow the central bank to target real interest rates to below minus 0 5 i e 0 minus 0 5 0 5 in this way of thinking of deflation or low inflation reduces central bank s flexibility in reviving the economy hence the policy of price stability must aim at a certain level of inflation which will give the central bank the flexibility to keep the economy moving along the growth path of economic prosperity and prevent it ever falling into a deflationary black hole the essence of all this is that a little bit of inflation is necessary in order to have economic prosperity and stability the inflationary buffer must be large enough to enable the fed to maneuver the economy away from the danger of deflation or so it is held mainstream economists believe that inflation at around 2 is not harmful to economic growth by this framework of thinking 2 inflation will allow the fed to reach a real interest rate of minus 2 while still maintaining the nominal interest rate at 0 which clearly could stimulate economic growth or so it is held while most experts are of the view that the inflation rate of 2 seems to be good for the economy a higher inflation rate say 10 could be actually bad why should a rate of inflation of 10 or higher be regarded as a bad thing if anything at an inflation rate of 10 it is likely that consumers are going to form rising inflation expectations and according to popular thinking in response to a high inflation rate consumers will speed up their expenditures on goods at present which should boost economic growth clearly there is a problem with this popular way of thinking inflation is not essentially a rise in prices inflation is not about general increases in prices as such but about the increase in the money supply as a rule the increase in the money supply sets in motion general increases in prices this however need not always be the case the price of a good is the amount of money asked per unit of it for a constant amount of money and an expanding quantity of goods prices will actually fall prices will also fall when the rate of increase in the supply of goods exceeds the rate of increase in the money supply for instance if the money supply increases by 5 and the quantity of goods increases by 10 prices will fall by 5 a fall in prices however cannot conceal the fact that we have inflation of 5 here because of the increase in the money supply the reason why inflation is bad news is not of increases in prices as such but because of the damage inflation inflicts to the wealth formation process here is why the chief role of money is to fulfill the role of the general medium of exchange money enables us to exchange something we have for something we want before an exchange can take place individuals must have something useful that they can exchange for money once they secure the money they can then exchange it for the goods they want now consider a situation in which money is created out of thin air this new money is no different from counterfeit money the counterfeiter exchanges the printed money for goods without producing anything useful he in fact exchanges nothing for something he takes from the pool of real goods without contributing to the pool the economic effect of money that was created out of thin air is the same as that of counterfeit money it impoverishes wealth generators the money created out of thin air diverts real wealth toward the holders of new money this weakens wealth generators ability to generate wealth and this in turn leads to a weakening in economic growth note that as a result of the increase in the money supply what we have here is more money per unit of goods and thus higher prices what matters however is not price rises as such but the increase in the money supply that sets in motion the exchange of nothing for something or the counterfeit effect the exchange of nothing for something weakens the process of real wealth formation therefore anything that promotes increases in the money supply can only make things much worse since changes in prices are just a symptom as it were and not the primary causative factor obviously countering a falling growth momentum of the cpi by means of loose monetary policy i e by creating inflation is bad news for the process of wealth generation and hence for the economy but in order to maintain their lives and well being individuals must buy goods and services in the present therefore from this perspective a fall in prices as such cannot be bad for the economy furthermore if a fall in the growth momentum of prices emerges on the back of the collapse of bubble activities in response to a softer monetary growth then this should be seen as good news the less non productive bubble activities there are the better it is for the wealth generators and hence for the overall pool of real wealth likewise if a fall in the growth momentum of the cpi emerges because of the expansion in real wealth for a given stock of money obviously this is great news since more people could now benefit from the expanding pool of real wealth we can thus conclude that contrary to the popular view a fall in the growth momentum of prices is always good news for the wealth generating process and hence for the economy given however that fed policy makers are of the view that a decline in the annual growth of prices is bad for the economy they are most likely to embark on very easy monetary

matteo salivini s league party is behind the idea of a mini bot photo pier marco tacca getty images some politicians in italy are enthusiastic about an idea called the mini bot that s short for mini bill of treasury and the idea is for the italian central bank to issue small denomination government bonds members of the public could then use the bond certificates to conduct transactions and pay taxes if it sounds like i ve just described money that s because a mini bot would be a lot like money but it s illegal for participants in the euro to issue their own currencies so officially the mini bot which is in the study phase and won t be issued anytime soon if at all wouldn t be a currency it would just be a government bond pegged to the euro and redeemable for euros but there is a wink and nudge element to that not a currency disclaimer some of the mini bot s advocates including claudio borghi a lawmaker in italy s ruling lega party hope to use it as a temporary currency as part of an exit from the euro as jason horowitz reports for the new york times in a book discussing the mini bot mr borghi wrote that once the mini bots were widely distributed in italy they would become a spare tire that will make the possible changeover to our currency much easier if italy ever decided to leave the euro as he hoped it wouldn t have to wait to print bank notes because everything has already been done on the day of the changeover it will be sufficient to declare the mini bots new currency he wrote the times says some mini bot advocates believe having the small bonds around would help avoid bank runs if italy were ever poised to leave the euro luigi zingales an economist at the university of chicago booth school of business says that s wrong it s not going to stop the bank run says zingales in fact the choice to issue mini bots could encourage a bank run because it would signal that italy might intend to exit the euro if italy were going to leave the euro and issue a new currency the government would presumably intend to significantly devalue the new currency to reduce the burden of government debt so depositors would want to get their money out of italian banks and into forms that wouldn t face devaluation such as physical euro notes or foreign deposits that said mini bots would help with another major problem that would arise if italy ever tried to leave the euro one of the major concerns of getting out of the euro is the country will find itself without currency for a while without cash says zingales everybody will treasure their euros and will like to trade in something else so if you have the mini bots they will be in lira and people can trade with that and because in italy there is still a huge amount of the economy that is a cash economy that s important this illustrates why leaving the euro has been a nonstarter even for greece a country that has more reason to regret its participation in the euro than italy exiting a shared currency is a complicated and messy process that can benefit from extensive logistical planning for example it s good to have a lot of replacement banknotes ready to go as soon as you switch to the new currency but if people expect that you will exit a shared currency there will be a bank run so you also want the currency switch to be a total surprise unfortunately while it s possible to achieve either extensive collaborative advance planning or a surprise announcement it is very difficult to achieve both for this reason zingales does not believe the mini bot is part of a viable strategy for an italian exit from the euro nor does he believe the government s intent in studying the mini bot is to plan for an actual exit which both the government and a majority of italians say they oppose he believes italy s populist leaders instead intend to use the mini bot as a threat during negotiations over italy s continued violation of eu fiscal guidelines by signaling a possible willingness to quit the euro and create a big mess for both italy and the rest of europe they may hope to secure fiscal concessions from germany and other northern european countries but zingales who is originally from italy and completed his undergraduate education there does not believe that will work either my understanding of germans is they re ready to cut their dick to spite their face he says they are prepared to pay any consequence to not be blackmailed by italians zingales argues that while italy has a problem with fiscal sustainability its biggest problem is economic stagnation the italian economy is no larger than it was 25 years ago and the country bleeds high skilled workers who can make more money elsewhere he advocates a compromise wherein the eu continues to give italy latitude to violate its fiscal targets while italy agrees to shift more of its spending away from current costs and toward capital investments that could grow its economic output and fiscal capacity and make it more attractive to workers and businesses in the future that approach has eluded italian governments across the ideological spectrum even as they have intermittently expressed the need to focus on competitiveness and growth but it would be more practical than trying to use mini bots as a bridge out of the euro

trade aid package in addition to 2018 s 12 billion funding package the market facilitation program mfp for 2019 administered by the farm service agency is intended to provide 14 5 billion in direct payments to an array of commodity producers a food purchase and distribution program valued at 1 4 billion and administered through the agricultural marketing service is expected to be used to purchase surplus commodities affected by trade retaliation such as fruits vegetables some processed foods beef pork lamb poultry and milk these are for distribution by usda s food and nutrition service to food banks schools and other outlets serving low income individuals the agricultural trade promotion program valued at 100 million is to be administered by the foreign agriculture service to assist in developing new export markets for u s producers on may 31 2019 the congressional research service crs says usda has released preliminary information about the 2019 mfp not public are what the payment rates will be and how they will be determined however unlike the 2018 mfp which limited payments to producers of seven commodities the 2019 mfp proposes to make payments to producers of an expanded list of field crops alfalfa hay barley canola corn crambe dry peas extra long staple cotton flaxseed lentils long and medium grain rice mustard seed dried beans oats peanuts rapeseed safflower sesame seed small and large chickpeas sorghum soybeans sunflower seed temperate japonica rice upland cotton and wheat as well as milk hogs and certain specialty crops tree nuts fresh sweet cherries cranberries and fresh grapes for field crop producers a single county payment rate per acre is to be calculated on a county by county basis using an as yet unannounced formula that is to consider historical production activity payments are to be based on each farm s 2019 planted acres in contrast 2018 mfp payments were based on harvested production as a result any acres prevented from being planted this year may not be eligible for mfp payments however they may qualify for pending disaster aid h r 2157 and for prevented planting benefits under crop insurance a farm s total acres eligible for mfp in 2019 cannot exceed its 2018 plantings hog producer payments are to be based on hog inventories while dairy producer payments are to be per hundred pounds of historical milk production the reference periods for these have yet to be determined mfp payments may be made in a series of payments the first of these is to begin in late july or early august the second and third tranches are to be evaluated relative to market conditions and trade opportunities for example a successful conclusion to the u s china trade negotiations could temper the need for further mfp payments otherwise if conditions warrant the second and third payments may be made in november 2019 and early january 2020 the share of payments to be issued in each tranche has not been announced usda has not indicated whether payment caps for individual producers will be imposed on mfp payments and whether an adjusted gross income agi threshold may be enforced usda did apply payment limits and an agi threshold to 2018 mfp payments another uncertainty is how usda will notify mfp outlays at the world trade organization where the united states has committed to limit outlays on programs that alter production incentives to less than 19 1 billion annually supplemental appropriations on june 3 2019 congress passed h r 2157 fy2019 supplemental which authorized supplemental appropriations for new and existing agricultural programs at the usda among other assistance the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the fy2019 supplemental totals more than 19 1 billion in new budget

the bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp will likely keep benchmark rates steady at its review this week with policy makers preferring to ensure that inflation maintains its downward trend analysts said in a businessworld poll six out of 10 economists polled by businessworld said the bsp is expected to leave rates untouched as its policy making monetary board meets on thursday with the rest predicting another 25 basis point bp reduction in benchmark yields i don t see a rate cut for the bsp monetary board meeting this month i think that the anticipated fed rate cut gives them additional room to wait as markets price these data in sun life financial economist patrick m ella said in an e mail nicholas antonio t mapa senior economist at ing bank nv manila branch said despite bsp governor benjamin e diokno s recent rhetoric on further cuts to policy rates and banks reserve requirement ratios the central bank will likely pause to see the effect of recent easing moves and remain data dependent the bsp chief has deemed rate cuts and monetary easing as inevitable but he stuck to script by also promising that adjustments would be data dependent and engineered by evidence and although we agree that the may upside surprise will likely be a blip in the downward path for inflation we expect bsp to take stock of the latest data and to also simultaneously gauge the impact of its recent double barrelled easing cut to rrp and reduction in rrr mr mapa said governor diokno has indicated that the bsp was ready to use all appropriate measures needed to ensure that they would provide an environment conducive for economic growth but also stressed that price stability will be the primary focus we believe that the bsp will pause at the june meeting to await further confirmation that inflation will return to its downward path which would further cement their short term and medium term inflation targets mr mapa added headline inflation stood at 3 2 last month up from the three percent in april but still slower than the 4 6 recorded in may 2018 the print also fell within the bsp s 2 8 3 6 inflation estimate range for that month year to date inflation averaged at 3 6 past the midpoint of the central bank s 2 4 target range and still above the 2 9 forecast for 2019 mr diokno earlier said the slight uptick in may inflation does not constitute a trend adding that the central bank is confident that the rise in prices will slow in the third quarter due to base effects declining world oil prices and the appreciating peso the bsp cut benchmark yields by 25 bps at its may 9 meeting bringing the interest rate on the central bank s overnight reverse repurchase facility to 4 5 effective may 10 the rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also reduced accordingly to 5 and 4 respectively the central bank also reduced the rrr of lenders by a percentage point effective may 31 to 17 for universal and commercial banks 7 for thrift banks and 4 for rural and cooperative banks the reserve ratios of big banks and thrift lenders will be cut by another 50 bps on june 28 and july 26 to settle at 16 and 6 respectively waiting for fed robert dan j roces security bank corp chief economist said in an e mail that the bsp will likely wait for clarity in the us central bank s policy direction before continuing its easing path the next cut will probably be either july or august for another 25 bps the reason is that the bsp in its data dependence stance will want to consider the effects of the first cuts they will likely ascertain the trajectory of inflation in the coming months prior to making another cut and likely take their cue as well with developments in the us fomc federal open market committee meetings mr roces said the us federal reserve s policymaking fomc is likely to stand pat on policy during its june 18 19 meeting but it still expected to trim its interest rates sometime this year meanwhile michael l ricafort rizal commercial banking corp s rcbc economics research division head said he expects a 25 bp cut in policy rates on thursday as easing inflation and possibility of fed rate cuts would justify future cuts in local currency rates now at 4 5 mr ricafort added that a sharp decline in global oil prices and a possible slowdown in global economic growth due to the lingering trade war between united states and china could also trigger a cut in local policy rates r j n ignacio
this article is more than 4 years old last month in the world s largest and longest election prime minister narendra modi secured another 5 year term in a landslide victory that delivered an undeniable mandate for modi to continue his structural and financial reform agenda underpinned by a litany of energy sector improvements that have already secured billions of dollars in u s investment the international energy agency said last month in its world energy investment 2019 that foreign energy investments in india grew to 85 billion under modi s leadership a record 12 increase which reflects the highest growth of energy investments anywhere in the world associated press india is the present and future for our industry if we can get it right india will clearly benefit but more significant the entire world will said chris tucker washington dc based global head of energy at fti consulting international investment in indian energy infrastructure could catapult the country s economy to become the fifth largest in the world according to the international monetary fund ironically taking over a spot held by its former colonial power the united kingdom this is a chance for the u s government to double down on supporting india s energy transition we have a solid foundation from the previous 16 years of cooperating with india on energy now s the time to help power the new india said kartikeya singh senior fellow of energy and national security program at the center for strategic and international studies singh also the deputy director and senior fellow of wadhwani chair in u s india policy studies is often in india leading csis engagement with indian states to boost public and private investment in energy canadians germans europeans australians and japanese investors have already lined up 1 trillion investment up for grabs and why not there s 1 trillion of energy improvement projects at stake from pipelines to transmission lines india is the world s third largest producer of electricity yet power outages are an expectation not an anomaly according to the world bank and the indian government about 90 of indian households have electricity the connections are there but it s hard to say for how many hours and how reliably the electrons are flowing singh said against this reality the indian ministry of power predicts energy consumption on the subcontinent will grow 4 2 per year for the next 20 years overtaking china as the world s largest energy growth market before 2030 improving the electricity grid commercializing the distribution piece of the grid and expanding transmission from population centers to rural areas is critical to accommodating the predicted demand 2018 bloomberg finance lp clarifying how electricity prices are set and making sure state energy providers and distribution companies are solvent are also critical power tariffs are used in india as an economic signal to determine power supply and demand across the grid but those power tariff patterns are distorted singh said they allow for cross subsidies which allow the domestic and agricultural industries in india to pay less per kilowatt hour than the cost of the power itself the result are major losses across the bottom lines of distribution companies which cannot be made whole under the current system singh said indian distribution companies need uniformity and common operational standards which he calls distribution franchising licensing to improve operational and technical performance this requires a massive infusion of capital in innovation he said also the agendas of the various energy related departments both at the center and state need to be consolidated do we need a ministry of coal and a ministry of power and a ministry that looks after hydro and another that looks after renewable energy especially when all power is power singh said creating a new spot market for electricity purchases in india will also help reduce renewable energy curtailment that we are experiencing in india right now he said india is doing everything all at once according to amrit singh deo mumbai based managing director for strategic communications for fti consulting with modi s win the government is making longer stronger strides to meet its reform goals he said the indian government is moving simultaneously on infrastructure expansion across the energy sector preparing to build power generation capacity improve energy efficiency integrate more renewable energy onto its grid expand pipeline infrastructure and import liquefied natural gas while creating a real time natural gas trading hub through which india could supply buyers across the entire region it s a massive number of projects to overhaul an entire energy system currently reliant on coal which accounts for about 75 of all electricity generated in india fatih birol iea s executive director worries about rising global emissions because of the growth of coal use in emerging economies in a statement following the release of the world energy investment 2019 last month birol said the world is storing up risks for the future by not investing enough in cleaner energy technologies to change course iea data show emissions are up and investment in fossil fuels is also up iea said the new report shows a growing mismatch between current trends and the paths to meeting the paris agreement and other sustainable development goals indians looking for more gas and renewables india s center for science and environment said air pollution indoor and outdoor in the country takes 2 5 years off a person s life thanks to major respiratory diseases and pollution that seeps into the bloodstream to harm every organ in the body but reducing indoor air pollution indoors requires moving the poorest communities reliant on wood charcoal and animal waste to cook with fuels like natural gas while india s coal use and emissions are rising the government is diversifying its energy mix to incorporate natural gas and renewables india has opened 52 coal mines since 2014 but replacing some of india s coal generation is high on the agenda modi aims to develop enough solar power to run at least one light bulb per home by the end of 2019 and develop at least 100 gigawatts of solar energy capacity by 2022 india is a singularly important energy market for u s companies particularly in helping to create a natural gas economy that will someday make a meaningful dent in power demand for india fti s tucker said last year the u s and india signed the u s india strategic energy partnership to support each other s energy sectors by making it easier and more attractive for u s energy companies to help india build out its energy system while securing a major market for u s lng associated press india wants to double down on natural gas increasing its share of natural gas in its total energy mix from 7 to 14 much of which will be met by lng imports fti s tucker said we think we can do even better than that and we have to if we re going to make any meaningful impact on the global climate challenges we know confront us tucker said the u s india partnership codified what president donald trump and prime minister modi announced during the june 2017 summit in washington meanwhile indian firms are investing 4 billion in u s shale assets coal plants can be cheaper overall global emissions are up because of increased global energy demand coupled with an increase in coal use to build a coal plant in asia costs about 200 million whereas a natural gas plant costs nearly 1 2 billion andrew minchener general manager of the iea clean coal center told the iea clean coal conference in houston this month if india continues to rely on coal in large measure its population and environmentalists worldwide may insist on clean energy technology to capture the emissions clean energy technologies namely carbon capture and storage ccs are a drag on gdp said constance hunter kpmg s chief economist speaking at the kpmg global energy conference in houston this month emerging markets will not be adopting the technologies to pair with their thermal coal plants any time soon it won t start in emerging markets because the transition costs are too high hunter said the u s and australia both leading on ccs and other clean energy technology development should find ways to drive down the cost of the technology including but not limited to the 45q tax credit she said the proposed u s tax break gives companies a 35 tax credit by 2024 per ton of co2

extensively on adoption of carbon capture technologies said we need additional incentives to bridge the gap between the actual cost and the economic value those tax credits can provide
published monday 17 june 2019 print disqus keith weiner monetary metals we will start this off with a pet peeve too often one is reading something about gold it starts off well enough discussing problems with the dollar or the bond market or a real estate bubble and them bam buy gold because the dollar is gonna be worthless that number again is 1 800 buy gold or we have another 1 800 got gold in case the lines on the first number are busy whether the writer is a bullion dealer or whether just some hodler a term from bitcoin it means holding on for dear life hoping for a higher price and an opportunity to unload some gold to make profit it matters not the buy gold message undermines the economic point perhaps the economics or pseudo economics point bolsters the buy gold message but it certainly hasn t over the last 8 years faulty logic on to our topic for today this economics point often takes the form defect x causes currencies to fail the dollar has defect x therefore the dollar will fail and that means people want to pay gold to merchants gresham s law states that if two forms of money have equal monetary value set by the government then the one that is undervalued will not circulate it is often taken to mean that if a precious metal coin and a base metal coin are both legal tender then the base metal will circulate and people will hoard the precious metal that is true but its application is broader than that the coinage act of 1792 established an official policy of bimetallism a dollar was defined to mean 24 75 grains of pure gold or 371 25 grains of pure silver it fixed the ratio of gold to silver at 15 to 1 the market ratio was closer to 15 5 of course it was not a fixed ratio but moved as all market prices do 15 being a lower number overvalues silver slightly that is the monetary value of silver was a bit higher than its commodity value and the opposite for gold predictably silver circulated and gold did not gresham s law was in full force and effect a more well known case occurred in 1965 when the us mint switched from silver to base metal a copper nickel alloy for quarters and dimes we had read an excerpt of a speech by president johnson which now seems to be offline in which he promised that the old silver coins would circulate alongside the new slugs but it did not work out that way it cannot and gresham tells us why not why gold does not circulate today today despite vast quantities of gold and silver coins they do not circulate gresham is not quite the explanation although the us one ounce silver coin is stamped with a legal tender value of 1 people are not stupid these coins are freely bought and sold based on the market price of silver plus a premium for being manufactured into a recognizable coin so why does no one pay the restaurant tab in silver eagles or pay debts in gold eagles yes yes we know about the legal tender laws not relevant here we have said many times that some people may be happy to be paid in gold or silver but no one wants to pay gold or silver out we are not going to describe here the reasons why people value gold and silver or why they expect the dollar to continue to be debased the steady desire to hold a gold coin is something entirely different than the weak desire to hold a dollar even dollar proponents will often say cash is trash that expression would not have been popular or even understood during the gold standard suffice to say that once they own a gold coin people prefer not to let go of it when it comes to paying for a steak dinner or a home repair they will take out the credit card but leave the precious metals hidden and safe so gold does not circulate we have repeatedly said that the only force capable of pulling gold out of hoards and into circulation is the payment of interest we plan to issue the first gold bond soon denominated in gold ounces with interest and principal paid in gold gold comes out to earn a return if the return is sufficient to justify the risk and otherwise is hoarded it may be sold to take dollar profits or when there is need for liquidity but otherwise it is held out of the market vast vast amounts are off the market virtually all of the gold mined in thousands of years of human history in fact that elephant is lifting its trunk trumpeting a fact to all who would listen while the debate and innovative business models keeps going what s the fact what is the elephant in this room gold is capital a dollar income no one well other than the prodigal son wants to spend his capital people want to spend their income not their capital so the gold is kept offline no one except for gold miners and monetary metals clients has income in gold income for everyone else is exclusively dollars dollar earners would have to exchange their dollars for gold then pay the merchant since gross margins are usually very tight the merchant would have to sell most of the gold to pay its vendors payroll rent etc regular readers will be thinking the round trip through gold from dollars to gold to dollars incurs a frictional loss that loss is the bid ask spread for retail investors that spread is likely 1 or more some online accounts are less this spread is the dollar earner s loss why would anyone want to take a loss on purpose they don t and gold is not used as a payment by dollar earners it s that simple ideal medium of exchange one can write at length about the problems of the dollar we do every week but that does not alter the fact that the dollar is a great medium of exchange it is perfect in fact let s state that again for emphasis the dollar is a perfect medium of exchange this is because it trades at no spread there is no loss to use the dollar it always trades at par the dollar will fail one day it is inevitable that will be a catastrophe to make a mere caldera like krakatoa seem a walk in the park by comparison millions of people will die and the survivors will be impoverished almost beyond comprehension of americans today but economics operates the way that it operates this is economics revenge against the dishonesty of irredeemable currency and inflation i e the counterfeiting of credit each economic actor seeks to maximize his gains and minimize his losses no one acts to try to bring a better system other than a few entrepreneurs and they are seeking profit anyways no one says let me pay out my gold because it will be good for the economy or good for society or it s honest money they pay out dollars because they are paid in dollars and there is no loss to pay them out they may buy some gold as savings but they don t pay out their savings they pay out their income dollars and they will continue to do so until they have an income in gold now that he s been acknowledged maybe this elephant can calm down and stop making such a racket supply and demand fundamentals the price of gold went up a buck but the price of silver dropped back 13 cents and the gold silver ratio marches further upwards keith spoke at a conference this week about how to analyze the fundamentals of supply and demand in gold and silver he talked about the basis of course another speaker spoke later about the supply and demand fundamentals of silver he covered all the topics we eschew solar increasing use of sensors and electronics in automobiles etc and at the end of his presentation he had two graphs without the ability to reproduce them here we will just summarize them one showed the correlation of silver to gold copper and oil it showed a very noticeable correlation to gold and not so much copper and virtually none with oil the second showed for each trading day over a period of time a gold colored up bar if silver traded with gold or a gray down bar if it traded with other commodities by eye it looked like over 99 of days silver was with gold in other words you can safely ignore all the talk about industrial uses of silver and mine production and recycling demand for silver as with gold is monetary reservation demand silver is still money whew right so why a ratio over 90 1 those who demand gold for monetary reserve are a different group than those who demand silver as always gold is owned by those rich enough to afford it an ounce of gold is several weeks of the wages of an unskilled laborer or more than a week of the wages of the median worker in the us and more than that outside america institutions including central banks demand gold almost exclusively with little silver other than perhaps family offices and hedge funds that may have a broader charter a 90 1 ratio tells us that the wage earners who cannot afford gold are either not able or not willing to increase their monetary reservation demand at least this is true relative to the asset owners who are near peak levels of equity after so many years of bull markets for a 20 silver and 75 1 ratio assuming gold is priced at 1 500 look not to a great increase in consumer electronics or industrial demand look to a shift in either mindset or capacity to buy silver among the wage earners and maybe a shift in sentiment among wealthier savers who have the option of using silver and who may be attracted to the relative bargain however from the look of that chart we ve been updated see below under silver today is not that day monetary metals is excited to be bringing the first gold bond to market please contact us if you are interested in investing now let s look at the only true picture of supply and demand for gold and silver but first here is the chart of the prices of gold and silver next this is a graph of the gold price measuredin silver otherwise known as the gold to silver ratio see here for an explanation of bid and offer prices for the ratio the ratio rose further here is the gold graph showing gold basis cobasis and the price of the dollar in terms of gold price the dollar was basically unchanged the scarcity i e cobasis dropped a hair the monetary metals gold fundamental price dropped slightly to 1 402 it s a bit above market but not a lot now let s look at silver the july silver contract approaches expiry and it s no surprise that it has tipped back into backwardation with a sharp increase in the cobasis however the silver basis continuous shows a slight drop in scarcity the monetary metals silver fundamental price dropped back to 15 49 here is an update of the ratios of the gold to silver basis and cobasis higher basis ratio means gold basis is above silver basis which means silver is less abundant there is a move favoring silver i e silver being the scarcer metal in current market conditions but this week it was a small one 2019 monetary metals digg this article published monday 17 june 2019 e mail print source

market log supply and pricing prices for domestic log sales in june are mostly unchanged from may as we move to the end of quarter 2 most mills anticipate some relief in log prices in quarter 3 due to the lower export log prices most mills will start to get more discerning over the quality of log they receive as the economic returns between the sawn timber grades is widening the larger pruned and structural grades are selling well but marketing the rest of the log is a struggle the domestic market for sawn timber has remained stable with settled weather through may the start of the winter season will see demand drop in some sectors we are seeing more finger joint mouldings and other remanufactured products being imported from china and this will place pressure on supply export log markets china total softwood log stocks across china have reduced slightly from last month to around 3 8 million m3 daily uplift from the ports is averaging about 78 000 m3 per day so demand is still

significantly reduced and is now just a trickle of container volume there has been more volume from the pacific north west but this is now expected to slow considerably many harvesting operations in

log market syp from the us is holding at us 123 for 12 minimum and us 118 for 10 minimum the previous government was re elected with a resounding majority and that significantly reduced any potential for market volatility it should augur well for the construction sector as many of the projects and initiatives of the government can continue unabated the indian government is also expected to announce initiatives to lure foreign institutional investors fiis into real estate and the construction sector to boost the economy the only macroeconomic negative is that the recent indian gdp growth

exporters of new zealand pine to india aubade new zealand ltd believe that the correction phase is almost completed and the coming year should see better business prospects the indian reserve bank is

conservative less helpful approach whereas private banks will step up to lend to businesses exchange rates the new zealand dollar nzd weakened against the united states dollar usd through may and this partially buffered new zealand forest owners from the falling cfr log prices in china the nzd has recently strengthened against the usd as stated last month and worth reiterating how the nzd and the

flexible that messaging will be traders are pricing a high probability of a july rate cut despite there being unusually high uncertainty particularly around trade lignos added she said a g20 meeting

type of risk details how to mitigate risk market risk agreeing to a purchase price for power over a long period could be risky if electricity prices decrease although unlikely this could happen because of new technologies regulatory changes better transmission capabilities a combination of these factors or for other reasons to mitigate market risk corporate buyers should consult a market expert and consider power price forecasts price and project revenue risk corporate ppa pricing structures may be fixed an agreed price per mwh with no escalation over time or flexible for example the parties may agree to a price increase over time linked to inflation or wholesale power prices the parties may also agree to set the price at a fixed discount to the fluctuating wholesale power price perhaps with a cap and floor so that if the wholesale price drops below the latter the corporate buyer pays the floor and if the wholesale price increases above the cap the corporate buyer pays only the cap to mitigate price risk if the price of power is expected to decrease a corporate buyer should opt for a flexible pricing mechanism in general developers will almost always benefit from a long term highly predictable pricing mechanism whereas lenders will want a fixed price in order to ensure that the project s revenues are certain and will be sufficient to repay any loans lenders traditionally manage project revenue risk using a range of tools including debt sizing the creation of ad hoc reserves an increase of interest rates and shorter term loans flexible and innovative solutions exist to balance the requirements of the various parties to a corporate ppa including fixed price only for a part of the debt tenor a fixed price long term corporate ppa including price reopeners allowing prices to be adjusted within certain limits and a corporate ppa for only part of the overall output of a renewable energy project with the expectation that the remaining capacity will be sold into the market on shorter term contracts tenor risk tenor risk relates to the period over which the corporate buyer must pay for power contracted for under the corporate ppa it can be a fixed duration period or a period that is subject to extensions triggered by certain conditions for power produced by an existing renewable energy plant the term of a corporate ppa in italy is usually short one to five years by contrast for power produced by a renewable energy plant that is under construction the term of the corporate ppa is usually longer 10 to 15 years with a fixed price comes the possibility of significant savings if power prices increase and the risk of being locked into a higher than market price if power prices decrease the corporate buyer s position on tenor risk will depend on its sensitivity to the fluctuation of power prices and estimated future demand for power developers will be guided both by lenders minimum term requirements and by power price forecasts lenders will expect that corporate ppas cover at least the term of the loan being contemplated and preferably also include a tail period after the maturity date especially when the lender is providing a high proportion of the capital to finance a new project put and call mechanisms may be implemented to balance the expectations of the various parties to the corporate ppa for instance if the wholesale power price goes up the corporate buyer may be granted the option to extend the term at a higher price if the wholesale power price goes down the developer may be granted the option to extend the term at a lower price in these scenarios the put and call prices are fixed in advance applying acceptable caps and floors currency or foreign exchange risk this risk arises because of the mismatch in the currency of debt obligations and revenue which exposes projects to the risk of devaluation over time this can result in reduced investments due to currency risk to mitigate currency or foreign exchange risk a currency swap with a third party provider to protect against devaluations may be used credit risk since corporate ppas are crucial revenue contracts the creditworthiness of the corporate buyer is also crucial in fact the attractiveness and bankability of long term corporate ppa agreements depend significantly on the creditworthiness of the corporate buyer credit risk covers the likelihood that the off taker will be unable to pay amounts owed under a corporate ppa even where a corporate buyer has a good reputation and global brand the creditworthiness of the particular contracting entity will be carefully scrutinised by both the developer and the lenders to mitigate credit risk lenders might require letters of credit parent company guarantees or another appropriately sized bank guarantee from an a rated bank multiple buyer structures where there is a single corporate buyer representing the aggregated demand of a group of buyers can also help spread credit risk so called club structures with club structures a lender may develop an internal bespoke credit rating for the blended buyer vehicle rather than rely solely or partially on third party credit support multiple buyer structures involving multiple corporates or a combination of corporates and utilities could be a way for sellers to increase appetite for large projects where a single large interested buyer does not exist scheduling risk scheduling risk relates to the deviations between forecasts of expected power production by generators to network operators and the actual outturn production typically scheduling risk is borne by the network operators which charge a fee for their services basis risk where a project is located can have a major impact on risks thereto this is commonly referred to as location risk numerous factors relating to location including transmission line congestion wind and solar intermittency and variability market saturation and state based or regional regulations can influence the value of a corporate ppa one type of location risk is basis risk which is the possibility of a mismatch between the market price at a project s delivery point and the prevailing price at the agreed upon trading point that is specified in the corporate ppa if the buyer and developer are located in different markets and the corporate ppa payments are linked to the wholesale price in the market that is local to the developer not the buyer the buyer is exposed to the basis risk in wholesale price movements this risk is usually more relevant to virtual corporate ppas but can also be relevant in physical corporate ppas in markets with zonal pricings if the retail price in the buyer s market and the wholesale price in the developer s market are not correlated the buyer becomes exposed to volatility in retail power purchasing in order to share basis risk and structure a bankable project some virtual corporate ppas provide for pricing adjustments on a fixed or floating basis or caps alternatively some project owners enter into ancillary agreements with third parties to hedge the basis risk either by their own initiative or by request of the lenders balancing risk balancing risk concerns the need to provide a continuous supply of power to the corporate buyer it is the risk of exposure to power system costs that arise when an asset s forecast generation is less than its actual generation the more an asset contributes to the power system s imbalance the higher the imbalance cost is the more the generation profile of an asset correlates with the market wide generation profile of its technology the more the asset s imbalance correlates with the overall power system imbalance resulting in higher imbalance costs one way to mitigate the seller s balancing risk is through outsourcing ie entering into an agreement with a third party or a party belonging to the same group as the corporate buyer which agrees to supplement for any shortfall in power production in order to meet the obligation of providing a continuous supply of power to the corporate buyer as an alternative the corporate buyer may execute a back to back electricity supply contract with a third party provider or with the electricity utility whereby the renewable supply is topped up with other electricity to provide the required power supply third parties or utilities will typically charge a fee to compensate for managing the balancing risk volume risk volume risk captures the variability of power generation of a plant over a given period which may be a season or a full year the risk may derive from climatic variations such as wind that is higher than expected one year or lower solar irradiation levels due to a cloudy summer corporate buyers will insist that the developer commits to a minimum volume over a reasonable period developers may agree to the extent that the minimum output requirements are achievable and aggregated over time failure to comply with a volume guarantee could lead to contractual damages being payable to compensate the corporate buyer for the actual cost of buying additional power in some jurisdictions so called weather derivatives have been implemented shape or profile risk shape or profile risk is connected to volume risk but it captures the fact that hourly generation will be variable depending on wind speed or solar irradiation irrespective of whether the overall volume over a given period is equal to the estimated volume the intermittent actual generation of power from a renewable energy plant may be different from the generation forecast and inconsistent with the baseload demand of a corporate buyer which is likely to be flatter with a pronounced variation between business and non business days developers may be willing to guarantee the mechanical availability of their plants but not actual output as that is influenced by weather conditions and operational strategy over which they have no control as a result shape or profile risk has so far been considered as a risk to be managed by the corporate buyer the corporate buyer may traditionally use its utility supplier as a sleeving agent to manage the variable volumes from a corporate ppa as part of the wider management of the corporate buyer s electricity demand however thanks to smart digital telemetry and process control innovative buy side mitigation tools are emerging which may allow the buyer to adapt its load on the grid to correspond to the generation profile of the renewable energy plant or imbalances on the grid these technologies can respond to an imbalance by switching off equipment that does not immediately require power until the price spike has passed although there are few cases where the seller offers to manage shape or profile risk the fact is that the seller may seek to absorb the risk by setting firm deliveries at a conservative level or outsource this risk by entering into a parallel financial hedge with a third party eg a trader to manage the commitment of financially settling against a firm volume proxy revenue swaps are hedging solutions where the hedge provider or the insurer pays the seller a pre agreed fixed price per annum rather than providing a fixed unit price per mwh generated or sold the project swaps the uncertain annual volume of power that would be generated by an efficient project with a more certain payment at a fixed long term price due to the need to pay up front structuring fees annual fees and services fee to put this structure in place hedging products may be a viable solution particularly for larger projects another innovative sell side mitigation tool for shape risk may be the integration of power storage technologies behind the metre together with renewable energy projects the seller can use the power storage system to smooth peaks in renewable generation as well as to assist with imbalance costs and other technical constraints on the grid construction risk in order for new projects to be built development or construction risk must be considered construction risk is risk that the plant is not completed in a timely basis or at all to mitigate construction risk a corporate buyer may negotiate adequate termination rights withdrawal rights and damages for any significant delay in the delivery of the power caused by the developer s delay in completing the project developers will focus on ensuring that a project s milestones include an appropriate buffer and will extend any deadlines on the occurrence of a force majeure event or a change in law lenders will be aligned with the interests of the developers and will carry out due diligence on both the project and the developer to evaluate the risk that that the corporate ppa may be terminated before a project is completed performance or operating risk performance or operating risk is the risk that the project does not perform as expected in terms of the level of mechanical availability warranted power curve wind or performance ratio solar photovoltaics corporate buyers may demand withdrawal rights from a corporate ppa in the event of poor project performance developers may try to deny demand for performance guarantees and argue that they are unnecessary in light of the economic incentive on a generator to maximise production if a performance guarantee is agreed developers and lenders will focus on ensuring that any requirements are reasonably achievable and that the contract also provides for cure rights developers will also seek to pass this risk to contractors in the supply chain change in law risk during the construction or operation of a project or during the term of a contract a change in law or a force majeure event may occur change in law risk captures the risk that developments in applicable legislation and regulation may upset the balance of risks and rewards under a corporate ppa developers will insist on having a mechanism to renegotiate material provisions of a corporate ppa that may be impacted by a change in law such mechanism will seek to restore the agreement to the original economic intent especially where the corporate ppa is the primary revenue resource for a project a corporate buyer will resist this especially in case of a fixed price corporate ppa on the basis that the fixed price justifies the project bearing this risk lenders will be focused on one thing ensuring that any change in law does not materially undermine the project s forecasted revenues

by ann saphir and howard schneider san francisco washington reuters the u s federal reserve facing fresh demands by president donald trump to cut interest rates is expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged at a policy meeting this week but possibly lay the groundwork for a rate cut later this year new economic projections that will accompany the u s central bank s policy statement on wednesday will provide the most direct insight yet into how deeply policymakers have been influenced by the u s china trade war trump s insistence on lower interest rates and recent weaker economic data analysts expect the dot plot of year end forecasts for the fed s benchmark overnight lending rate the federal funds rate will show a growing number of policymakers are open to cutting rates in the coming months though nowhere near as aggressively as investors expect or trump wants the fed is also widely though not universally expected to remove a pledge to be patient in taking future action on rates opening the door to a possible cut at its coming policy meetings risks may be rising but i don t think they want to box themselves into a corner said carl tannenbaum chief economist at northern trust the markets are set up for a cut in july and if they don t get it financial conditions will tighten the federal funds rate is currently set in a range of 2 25 to 2 50 the fed s policy setting committee is due to release its latest statement and economic projections at 2 p m edt 1800 gmt on wednesday after the end of a two day meeting fed chairman jerome powell will hold a press conference shortly after mind the dots the fed s last set of economic and policy projections released in march showed most policymakers foresaw no need to change rates this year and only very gradual rate hikes thereafter for a graphic of the gap between market and fed expectations please see but since that meeting the economic outlook has become cloudier recent u s retail sales numbers were strong but while unemployment has held near a 50 year low of 3 6 u s employers created a paltry 75 000 jobs in may inflation which powell says is low in part because of temporary factors continues to undershoot the fed s 2 target the atlanta fed forecast on friday that gross domestic product will increase at a 2 1 percent annualized rate in the april june quarter a drop from the 3 1 percent pace of the first three months of the year trade uncertainty has increased as well with trump using the threat of tariffs on goods from mexico to force the country to curb the number of mostly central american immigrants crossing the u s mexico border he has also vowed to slap more tariffs on chinese imports if no trade deal is reached when he meets chinese president xi jinping at a group of 20 summit at the end of this month in japan concern that mounting tariffs could further slow u s and global economic growth is one of the chief reasons traders in interest rate futures loaded up on contracts anticipating three u s rate cuts by the end of the year fed officials may have reason to trim their rate outlook a bit but meeting market expectations would involve a dramatic shift nine of the fed s current 17 policymakers would have to move their rate projections downward for the median to reflect a single cut let alone three powell will do what he can to try to downplay the dots especially if they don t show what the markets want them to show said roberto perli economist at cornerstone macro he will have a tough time adding to the pressure for a rate cut is a yield curve inversion in parts of the market for u s government debt historically a precursor of recessions the three month treasury bill for instance has paid out a higher rate than a 5 year treasury note for the last several months running and trump who has said that rates should be lowered by perhaps a full percentage point or more continues to publicly berate the fed and powell his handpicked chairman for refusing to act i ve waited long enough trump said in an interview with abc news last week talking favorably of the old days when presidents lyndon johnson and richard nixon intervened forcefully in fed policy and set the stage many economists argue for the high inflation economic volatility and recessions that followed in the 1970s downward shift most of the more than 100 economists polled june 7 12 by reuters say they are not penciling in a rate cut until the third quarter of next year but views are shifting rapidly forty respondents expected at least one rate cut sometime in 2019 up from just eight who did in the previous poll within the u s central bank st louis fed president james bullard is the only policymaker who has said a rate cut may be needed soon several others have signaled a readiness to move off their wait and see stance with powell saying earlier this month in a speech in chicago that the fed will act as appropriate in the face of risks posed by the global trade war and other developments the word patient which had been repeatedly used by the fed since early this year to signal its willingness to hold off further rate hikes was notably absent from powell s remarks though the fed chief stopped well short of suggesting a rate cut was coming soon the fed raised rates four times in 2018 but has since abandoned plans to continue lifting borrowing costs this year it is likely to avoid signaling any move to cut rates until it is ready to deliver predicted bruce monrad a high yield bond portfolio manager at boston based northeast investors trust nevertheless monrad added fed policymakers may have tied their own hands by letting bets in financial markets stray so far they have had six months to control the rhetoric they really haven t walked back the market

author stephen kirchner menafn the conversation with its official cash rate now expected to fall below 1 to a new extraordinarilylow close to zero all sorts of people are saying that the reserve bank is in danger of running out of ammunition ammunition might be needed if as during the last financial crisis it needs to cut rates by several percentage points this view assumes that when the cash rate hits zero there is nothing more the reserve bank can do the view is not only wrong it is also dangerous because if taken seriously it would mean that all of the next rounds of stimulus would have to be come from fiscal spending and tax policy even though fiscal policy is probably ineffective long term its effects beingneutralised by a floating exchange rate the experience of the united states shows that australia s reserve bank could quite easily take measures that would have the same effect as cutting its cash rate a further 2 5 percentage points that is 2 5 percentage points below zero reserve bank cash rate since 1990 reserve bank of australia in a reportreleased on tuesdayby the university of sydney s united states studies centre i document the successes and failures of the us approach to so called quantitative easing qe between 2009 and 2014 it demonstrates that it is always possible to change the instrument of monetary policy from changes in the official interest rate to changes in other interest rates by buying and holding other financial instruments such as long term government and corporate bonds australia can learn form us mistakes university of sydney united states studies centre the more aggressively the reserve bank buys those bonds from private sector owners the lower the long term interest rates that are needed to place bonds and the more former owners whose hands are filled with cash that they have to make use of in the us the federal reserve also used forward guidance about the likely future path of the us federal funds rate to convince markets the rate would be kept low for an extended period it is unclear which mechanism was the most powerful or whether the fed even neededto buy bonds in order to make forward guidance work however in a stressed economic environment it is worth trying both read more the reserve bank will cut rates again and again until we lift spending and push up prices as it comes to be believed that interest rates will stay low for an extended period the exchange rate will fall making it easier for australian corporates to borrow from overseas and to export and compete with imports the consensus of the academic literature is that qe cut long term interest rates by around one percentage point and had economic effects equivalent to cuttingthe us federal fund rate bya further 2 5 percentage pointsafter it approached zero qe need not have limits based on us estimates australia s reserve bank would need to purchase assets equal to around 1 5 of australia s gross domestic product to achieve the equivalent of a 0 25 percentage point reduction in the official cash rate that s around a 30 billion with over a 780 billion in long term government commonwealth and state securities on issue there s enough to accommodate a very large program of reserve bank buying and the bank could also follow the example of the fed and expand the scope of purchases to include non government securities including residential mortgage backed securities it could also learn from us mistakes the fed was slow to cut its official interest rate to near zero and slow to embark on qe in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis its first attempt was limited in size and duration its success in using qe to stimulate the economy should be viewed as the lower bound of what s possible even if it becomes less effective as it grows it oftensuggested although it isby no means certain that monetary policy becomes less effective when interest rates get very low but this isn t necessarily an argument to use monetary policy less it could just as easily be an argument to use it more because there is no in principle limit to how much qe a central bank can do it is always possible to do more and succeed in lifting inflation rate and spending fiscal policy may well be even less effective to the extent that it succeeds it is likely to push up the australian dollar making australian businesses less competitive us economistscott sumnerbelieves the extra bang for the buck from government spending or tax cuts known as the multiplier is close to zero reserve bank governor philip lowe this month appealed forhelp from the government itself asking in particular for extra spending on infrastructure and measures to raise productivity growth read more vital signs if we fall into a recession and we might we ll have ourselves to blame he is correct in identifying the contribution other policies can make to driving economic growth no one seriously thinks reserve bank monetary policy can or should substitute for productivity growth but it is a good perhaps a very good substitute for government spending that does not contribute to productivity growth three myths about quantitative easing in the paper i address several myths about qe one is that it is printing money it no more prints money than does conventional monetary policy it pushes money into private sector hands by adjusting interest rates albeit a different set of rates another myth is that it promotes inequality by helping the rich to get richer it is a widely believed myth former coalition treasurerjoe hockeytold the british institute of economic affairs in 2014 that loose monetary policy actually helps the rich to get richer why because we ve seen rising asset values wealthier people hold the assets but it widens inequality no more than conventional monetary policy and may not widen it at all if it is successful in maintaining sustainable economic growth a third myth is that it leads to excessive inflation or socialism in the us it has in fact been associated with some of the lowest inflation since the second world war these days central banks are more likely to err on the side of creating too little inflation than too much some have argued that qe in the us is to blame for the rise of left wing populists like alexandria ocasio cortez and millennial socialism but it is probably truer to say that their grievances grew out of too tight rather than too lose monetary policy qe has been road tested we ve little to fear from it just as we have had little to fear from conventional monetary policy rba quantitative easing qe

vol 43 no 24 friday june 14 2019 ap fact check trump fudges facts on economy 2020 voting print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required washington ap an eye toward his 2020 campaign president donald trump is turning to a familiar playbook of exaggerated boasts about economic performance and overdrawn complaints about a race tilted against him he insisted the electoral college gives democrats a big advantage in u s presidential elections making it difficult for republicans like himself to win that s wrong though in 2016 he often described the election as rigged against him trump in fact wouldn t have won the presidency without the electoral college system in which the votes of smaller rural states that tend to vote republican are weighted more heavily than big democratic leaning states like new york and california trump also claimed over the weekend that he s presided over one of the best u s economies ever he s wrong about that too the misleading rhetoric over the past week came as the president prepared to kick off his re election campaign tuesday in florida in trump s reckoning an iran tamed by him no longer cries death to america the border wall with mexico is proceeding apace the estate tax has been lifted off the backs of farmers the remains of u s soldiers from north korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history these claims range from flatly false to mostly so here s a look electoral college trump in part addressing polls finding him lagging some of the 2020 democratic candidates it s always tougher for the republican because you know i don t know people people never cover this but the electoral college is very much steered to the democrats it s a big advantage for the democrats it s very much harder for the republicans to win fox news interview friday the facts actually the electoral college s unique system of electing presidents is a big reason why trump won the presidency four candidates in history including al gore in 2000 have won a majority of the popular vote only to be denied the presidency by the electoral college all were democrats in the 2016 election democrat hillary clinton received nearly 2 9 million more votes than trump after racking up more lopsided victories in big states such as new york and california according to election data compiled by the associated press but she lost the presidency due to trump s winning margin in the electoral college which came after he narrowly won less populous midwestern states such as michigan and wisconsin unlike the popular vote electoral college votes are set equal to the number of u s representatives in each state plus its two senators that means more weight is given to a single vote in a small state than the vote of someone in a large state ___ economy and taxes trump no president has done what i have in the first 2 1 2 years of his presidency including the fact that we have one of the best economies in the history of our country tweets saturday the facts this is one of trump s most frequent falsehoods the economy is solid but it s not one of the best in the country s history trump is also claiming full credit for an economic expansion that began under president barack obama in mid 2009 the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 while the economy has shown strength it grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates ___ trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 ___ trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns ___ russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report he said no collusion the report said no collusion abc news interview aired sunday trump the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in his interview with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening ___ republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier ___ trump what kind of a rigged deal is this and then on top of it after two years and after being the most transparent in history abc news interview aired sunday trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of ceremonies ask audiences to tone it down but it was heard for example from the crowd this month when khamenei exhorted thousands to stand up against u s bullying in one variation a demonstrator at tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english ___ north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea ___ border wall trump the wall is going up it s going up rapidly we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year and we just won the lawsuit on the wall fox news interview friday trump by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 400 to 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none ___ trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks on june 10 with indianapolis 500 champions trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending ___ trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview on june 10 the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets ___ federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview on june 10 the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics ___ automakers trump all of the car companies you know long before i got here we lost 32 percent of our car industry our automobile manufacturing business to mexico fox news interview friday trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 ___ trump if i put tariffs on as an example mexico you know what would happen 25 all the car companies would move back to the united states because they don t want to pay the 25 fox news interview friday trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the

had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special

fed likely to resist pressure to cut u s rates this week by ann saphir and howard schneider san francisco washington reuters the u s federal reserve facing fresh demands by president donald trump to cut interest rates is expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged at a policy meeting this week but possibly lay the groundwork for a rate cut later this year new economic projections that will accompany the u s central bank s policy statement on wednesday will provide the most direct insight yet into how deeply policymakers have been influenced by the u s china trade war trump s insistence on lower interest rates and recent weaker economic data analysts expect the dot plot of year end forecasts for the fed s benchmark overnight lending rate the federal funds rate will show a growing number of policymakers are open to cutting rates in the coming months though nowhere near as aggressively as investors expect or trump wants the fed is also widely though not universally expected to remove a pledge to be patient in taking future action on rates opening the door to a possible cut at its coming policy meetings risks may be rising but i don t think they want to box themselves into a corner said carl tannenbaum chief economist at northern trust the markets are set up for a cut in july and if they don t get it financial conditions will tighten advertisement advertisement the federal funds rate is currently set in a range of 2 25 to 2 50 the fed s policy setting committee is due to release its latest statement and economic projections at 2 p m edt 1800 gmt on wednesday after the end of a two day meeting fed chairman jerome powell will hold a press conference shortly after mind the dots the fed s last set of economic and policy projections released in march showed most policymakers foresaw no need to change rates this year and only very gradual rate hikes thereafter for a graphic of the gap between market and fed expectations please see advertisement advertisement but since that meeting the economic outlook has become cloudier recent u s retail sales numbers were strong but while unemployment has held near a 50 year low of 3 6 u s employers created a paltry 75 000 jobs in may inflation which powell says is low in part because of temporary factors continues to undershoot the fed s 2 target the atlanta fed forecast on friday that gross domestic product will increase at a 2 1 percent annualized rate in the april june quarter a drop from the 3 1 percent pace of the first three months of the year trade uncertainty has increased as well with trump using the threat of tariffs on goods from mexico to force the country to curb the number of mostly central american immigrants crossing the u s mexico border advertisement advertisement he has also vowed to slap more tariffs on chinese imports if no trade deal is reached when he meets chinese president xi jinping at a group of 20 summit at the end of this month in japan concern that mounting tariffs could further slow u s and global economic growth is one of the chief reasons traders in interest rate futures loaded up on contracts anticipating three u s rate cuts by the end of the year fed officials may have reason to trim their rate outlook a bit but meeting market expectations would involve a dramatic shift nine of the fed s current 17 policymakers would have to move their rate projections downward for the median to reflect a single cut let alone three powell will do what he can to try to downplay the dots especially if they don t show what the markets want them to show said roberto perli economist at cornerstone macro he will have a tough time advertisement advertisement adding to the pressure for a rate cut is a yield curve inversion in parts of the market for u s government debt historically a precursor of recessions the three month treasury bill for instance has paid out a higher rate than a 5 year treasury note for the last several months running and trump who has said that rates should be lowered by perhaps a full percentage point or more continues to publicly berate the fed and powell his handpicked chairman for refusing to act i ve waited long enough trump said in an interview with abc news last week talking favorably of the old days when presidents lyndon johnson and richard nixon intervened forcefully in fed policy and set the stage many economists argue for the high inflation economic volatility and recessions that followed in the 1970s downward shift advertisement advertisement most of the more than 100 economists polled june 7 12 by reuters say they are not penciling in a rate cut until the third quarter of next year but views are shifting rapidly forty respondents expected at least one rate cut sometime in 2019 up from just eight who did in the previous poll within the u s central bank st louis fed president james bullard is the only policymaker who has said a rate cut may be needed soon several others have signaled a readiness to move off their wait and see stance with powell saying earlier this month in a speech in chicago that the fed will act as appropriate in the face of risks posed by the global trade war and other developments the word patient which had been repeatedly used by the fed since early this year to signal its willingness to hold off further rate hikes was notably absent from powell s remarks though the fed chief stopped well short of suggesting a rate cut was coming soon advertisement advertisement the fed raised rates four times in 2018 but has since abandoned plans to continue lifting borrowing costs this year it is likely to avoid signaling any move to cut rates until it is ready to deliver predicted bruce monrad a high yield bond portfolio manager at boston based northeast investors trust nevertheless monrad added fed policymakers may have tied their own hands by letting bets in financial markets stray so far they have had six months to control the rhetoric they really

what are we to make of the recent flurry of contributions from academic economists of the left notably here a series penned by neil coleman on rebuilding our shattered economy it brings to mind an old joke a physicist a chemist and an economist are stranded on a desert island with no tools but they do have tins of food the physicist and the chemist each devise an ingenious mechanism for opening the tins the economist says assume we have a can opener assuming a can opener into existence is not the only problem it is the idea that where we are now is the recycling of outdated ideas and that they have not been taken seriously before because they don t conform to conservative economic orthodoxy the debate can t move forward because it becomes an ideological battle between firmly held ideas of self identified left wing economists and those whom they describe as right wing or conservative it s as if they want a rerun of the second half of the 20th century on their academic or think tank salaries when almost everyone else has moved on these economists advise us that what ails the economy is something to do with austerity measures and contractionary monetary policy both these claims are beyond bizarre ever since 2008 south africa has been running significant deficits breaching spending targets regularly that is the opposite of austerity one result of this is a ballooning debt north of r3 trillion and the cost of servicing it is the fastest growing item in current expenditure in developed rich countries that level of indebtedness might seem acceptable but for a country like ours it is far too high it is a wondrous thing that that debt whether held domestically or by foreigners is in our own currency not every country and some much stronger than ours including several in the eurozone has that privilege south africa does largely because we have the benefit of very deep and liquid capital markets and we can have those in our own currency because the rand has not been debased yet the idea that we should have a more expansionary monetary policy because we can afford to have higher inflation demonstrates that those proposing this refuse to understand that it is the very rich who can best cope and even prosper in a high inflationary environment further we are a relatively open economy with low rates of savings dependent on inflows of capital looking for a real return you can t simply assume that away there is little point in getting into pointless debates about which economic models work state led economic development can and has succeeded elsewhere particularly in a number of asian countries scandinavian style social democracy does appear to result in more equal societies even if left wing economists often fail to see the widespread use of market based mechanisms in those countries let s not quibble with the fact that state led strategies to transform an economy or drive industrialisation can work and have worked in less than a generation the world s second biggest economy china has grown from being one of the poorest countries to a per capita income that surged past south africa s around 2013 and latin america s in 2017 let s also not quibble with the fact that almost all rich countries including the us have seen the state play a far bigger role in their economies as they have become richer there is a lot of support for a wide range of interventions even if most of it is contested by ideologues on what most people categorise as the right but let s look at all those examples in the most generous possible way china s and most of the so called asian tigers industrialisation was undertaken on the back of ultra cheap and exploited at least initially labour and with little democracy or democratic rights those countries despite their widespread conditions of poverty had very high savings rates but more than that they had a core bureaucracy and political leadership that had an ability to plan coordinate and implement steps to achieve a vision for economic development scandinavian countries are referred to as high trust societies that means societies that display a high degree of mutual trust not imposed by outside contractual legal or hierarchical regulation but based on prior moral consensus what do we have a country with declining industrialisation built on the exploitation of natural resources and the brutal dispossession of the majority of the population that after at least a century of struggle made a democratic transition more recently we have spurned the opportunities afforded us by that democratic transition and failed to address the legacies of our past our relatively expensive education system still produces learners who can t read for meaning or undertake basic calculations instead of dealing with high levels of concentration we have state sanctioned cartels in crucial input markets instead of opening up the economy we have a form of elite capture commonly referred to as bee government expenditure is high for an economy at our stage of development but far too much of it is absorbed by civil servants who appear unable to do the work expected of them more than 40 of government expenditure is outsourced state owned companies that might be expected to play some developmental role in the economy are under capitalised close to bankruptcy and driving up the cost of the main cause of inflation in this economy their administered and not market prices organised labour having fought for decent wages and fair working conditions and playing a big part in securing the democratic transition is not going to go along with a low wage route to re industrialisation and has enough political power unless runaway inflation decimates the value of their wages to prevent even a suggestion of this route of course south africans don t save enough so we have to rely on the savings of others through debt that comes with certain conditions such as a reasonable return to debt holders we can t blithely go beyond the debates on state capture because there is no consensus on how it got to this point the shenanigans of the zuma regime is one thing but consider that a non zuma political formation the eff with only the smallest opportunity allegedly plundered vbs its depositors and guarantors perhaps it is unfair to point at these examples is it not also state capture when large numbers of teachers are not in class teaching when they should be teaching subjects they have not mastered and then have their union sadtu resisting steps to remedy the situation anybody interacting with the public sector has their own stories to tell the reality is that we are a low trust society a low trust society is one that is kinship based and where outcomes include difficulties in forming and maintaining corporate structures institutions that are corrupted or dysfunctional high levels of crime and declining willingness to pay tax the argument is not whether policies favoured by the left work or even whether a can opener is the best tool to open a tin of food but whether the necessary conditions for their favoured policies are in place take eskom for example it is a wholly state owned monopoly responsible for almost all of south africa s electricity supply a developmental model favoured by the left but it is in an awful mess even starting to fix it will impose high costs and pain for all south africans economists from the left will have their own ideas on what should or shouldn t be done especially when it comes to privatisation of significant parts of the electricity system but if these economists are to be taken seriously they need to have a good idea about how eskom got to this point simply saying that we have to move beyond state capture is not good enough an honest assessment of what pre conditions could exist and which are absent could lead in interesting directions particularly if the theory of second best is taken into account assuming that the optimal outcome is a fast growing industrialising economy with low unemployment and low levels of inequality but to achieve this with standard progressive economic policies requires a number of pre conditions to be in place what happens if one of them is missing working with what you think you have in place and pursuing the same policies won t get you closer to the desired outcome it may make things worse something close to the best outcome can more likely be achieved with completely different policies that work with the starting conditions we have

washington ap an eye toward his 2020 campaign president donald trump is turning to a familiar playbook of exaggerated boasts about economic performance and overdrawn complaints about a race tilted against him he insisted the electoral college gives democrats a big advantage in u s presidential elections making it difficult for republicans like himself to win that s wrong though in 2016 he often described the election as rigged against him trump in fact wouldn t have won the presidency without the electoral college system in which the votes of smaller rural states that tend to vote republican are weighted more heavily than big democratic leaning states like new york and california trump also claimed over the weekend that he s presided over one of the best u s economies ever he s wrong about that too the misleading rhetoric over the past week came as the president prepared to kick off his re election campaign tuesday in florida in trump s reckoning an iran tamed by him no longer cries death to america the border wall with mexico is proceeding apace the estate tax has been lifted off the backs of farmers the remains of u s soldiers from north korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history these claims range from flatly false to mostly so here s a look electoral college trump in part addressing polls finding him lagging some of the 2020 democratic candidates it s always tougher for the republican because you know i don t know people people never cover this but the electoral college is very much steered to the democrats it s a big advantage for the democrats it s very much harder for the republicans to win fox news interview friday advertising the facts actually the electoral college s unique system of electing presidents is a big reason why trump won the presidency four candidates in history including al gore in 2000 have won a majority of the popular vote only to be denied the presidency by the electoral college all were democrats in the 2016 election democrat hillary clinton received nearly 2 9 million more votes than trump after racking up more lopsided victories in big states such as new york and california according to election data compiled by the associated press but she lost the presidency due to trump s winning margin in the electoral college which came after he narrowly won less populous midwestern states such as michigan and wisconsin unlike the popular vote electoral college votes are set equal to the number of u s representatives in each state plus its two senators that means more weight is given to a single vote in a small state than the vote of someone in a large state ___ economy and taxes trump no president has done what i have in the first 2 1 2 years of his presidency including the fact that we have one of the best economies in the history of our country tweets saturday the facts this is one of trump s most frequent falsehoods the economy is solid but it s not one of the best in the country s history trump is also claiming full credit for an economic expansion that began under president barack obama in mid 2009 the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter advertising in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 while the economy has shown strength it grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates ___ trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers advertising they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 ___ trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 advertising according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns ___ russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report he said no collusion the report said no collusion abc news interview aired sunday trump the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term advertising he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in his interview with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening ___ republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts advertising the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier ___ trump what kind of a rigged deal is this and then on top of it after two years and after being the most transparent in history abc news interview aired sunday trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry advertising in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of ceremonies ask audiences to tone it down but it was heard for example from the crowd this month when khamenei exhorted thousands to stand up against u s bullying advertising in one variation a demonstrator at tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english ___ north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 advertising last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea ___ border wall trump the wall is going up it s going up rapidly we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year and we just won the lawsuit on the wall fox news interview friday trump by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 400 to 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction advertising so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none ___ trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks on june 10 with indianapolis 500 champions trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs advertising the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending ___ trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview on june 10 the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion advertising the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets ___ federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview on june 10 the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board advertising there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics ___ automakers trump all of the car companies you know long before i got here we lost 32 percent of our car industry our automobile manufacturing business to mexico fox news interview friday trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 ___ trump if i put tariffs on as an example mexico you know what would happen 25 all the car companies would move back to the united states because they don t want to pay the 25 fox news interview friday advertising trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated ___ associated press writers christopher rugaber eric

the us federal reserve facing fresh demands by president donald trump to cut interest rates is expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged at a policy meeting this week but possibly lay the groundwork for a rate cut later this year new economic projections that will accompany the u s central bank s policy statement on wednesday will provide the most direct insight yet into how deeply policymakers have been influenced by the us china trade war trump s insistence on lower interest rates and recent weaker economic data story continues below advertisement remove ad analysts expect the dot plot of year end forecasts for the fed s benchmark overnight lending rate the federal funds rate will show a growing number of policymakers are open to cutting rates in the coming months though nowhere near as aggressively as investors expect or trump wants the fed is also widely though not universally expected to remove a pledge to be patient in taking future action on rates opening the door to a possible cut at its coming policy meetings risks may be rising but i don t think they want to box themselves into a corner said carl tannenbaum chief economist at northern trust the markets are set up for a cut in july and if they don t get it financial conditions will tighten the federal funds rate is currently set in a range of 2 25 to 2 50 the fed s policy setting committee is due to release its latest statement and economic projections at 2 p m edt 1800 gmt on wednesday after the end of a two day meeting fed chairman jerome powell will hold a press conference shortly after mind the dots story continues below advertisement remove ad the fed s last set of economic and policy projections released in march showed most policymakers foresaw no need to change rates this year and only very gradual rate hikes thereafter for a graphic of the gap between market and fed expectations but since that meeting the economic outlook has become cloudier recent u s retail sales numbers were strong but while unemployment has held near a 50 year low of 3 6 u s employers created a paltry 75 000 jobs in may inflation which powell says is low in part because of temporary factors continues to undershoot the fed s 2 target the atlanta fed forecast on friday that gross domestic product will increase at a 2 1 percent annualized rate in the april june quarter a drop from the 3 1 percent pace of the first three months of the year trade uncertainty has increased as well with trump using the threat of tariffs on goods from mexico to force the country to curb the number of mostly central american immigrants crossing the u s mexico border he has also vowed to slap more tariffs on chinese imports if no trade deal is reached when he meets chinese president xi jinping at a group of 20 summit at the end of this month in japan concern that mounting tariffs could further slow u s and global economic growth is one of the chief reasons traders in interest rate futures loaded up on contracts anticipating three u s rate cuts by the end of the year fed officials may have reason to trim their rate outlook a bit but meeting market expectations would involve a dramatic shift nine of the fed s current 17 policymakers would have to move their rate projections downward for the median to reflect a single cut let alone three powell will do what he can to try to downplay the dots especially if they don t show what the markets want them to show said roberto perli economist at cornerstone macro he will have a tough time adding to the pressure for a rate cut is a yield curve inversion in parts of the market for u s government debt historically a precursor of recessions the three month treasury bill for instance has paid out a higher rate than a 5 year treasury note for the last several months running and trump who has said that rates should be lowered by perhaps a full percentage point or more continues to publicly berate the fed and powell his handpicked chairman for refusing to act i ve waited long enough trump said in an interview with abc news last week talking favorably of the old days when presidents lyndon johnson and richard nixon intervened forcefully in fed policy and set the stage many economists argue for the high inflation economic volatility and recessions that followed in the 1970s downward shift most of the more than 100 economists polled june 7 12 by reuters say they are not penciling in a rate cut until the third quarter of next year but views are shifting rapidly forty respondents expected at least one rate cut sometime in 2019 up from just eight who did in the previous poll within the u s central bank st louis fed president james bullard is the only policymaker who has said a rate cut may be needed soon several others have signaled a readiness to move off their wait and see stance with powell saying earlier this month in a speech in chicago that the fed will act as appropriate in the face of risks posed by the global trade war and other developments the word patient which had been repeatedly used by the fed since early this year to signal its willingness to hold off further rate hikes was notably absent from powell s remarks though the fed chief stopped well short of suggesting a rate cut was coming soon the fed raised rates four times in 2018 but has since abandoned plans to continue lifting borrowing costs this year it is likely to avoid signaling any move to cut rates until it is ready to deliver predicted bruce monrad a high yield bond portfolio manager at boston based northeast investors trust nevertheless monrad added fed policymakers may have tied their own hands by letting bets in financial markets stray so far they have had six months to control the rhetoric they really haven t walked

through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier trump

mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the

instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter
