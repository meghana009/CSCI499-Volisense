yuan china is slowly trying to replace the us dollar us dollar hegemony is at risk thanks to changes in the global economy and the long term consequences of the us china trade war china has been working to make the yuan a more central part of the global economy is at risk thanks to changes in the global economy and the long term consequences of the us china trade war china has been working to make the yuan a more central part of the global economy by issuing debt denominated in usd china is making a long term bet that it will be cheaper to pay back its loans over time in the us dollar it believes the value of the us dollar will fall issuing debt in a foreign currency isn t uncommon traders may recall that some famous investors rolled over their usd denominated debt into jpy denominated debt ahead of abenomics and the long decline in the value of the japanese yen looking for longer term forecasts on the chinese yuan and us dollar check out the dailyfx trading guides us china trade war phase 1 deal it was early october when officials from both china and the united states said that progress had been made towards a phase 1 trade deal due to be signed before the end of the year and yet with the thanksgiving holiday descending upon markets there are no clear indications that a us china trade war phase 1 deal will be signed before the end of the year perhaps the most interesting news related to the us china trade war at the end of november was not about the phase 1 deal itself but rather some financing moves china is making at the margins on november 25 bloomberg news reported that the chinese ministry of finance was readying a sovereign debt offering denominated in us dollars to the tune of 6 billion this debt would come in tenors of three five 10 and 20 years chinese borrowers are issuing usd denominated debt at a record pace with 195 billion recorded issuance so far in 2019 bloomberg news noted that the chinese usd denominated bond market is just shy of 750 billion this begs the question why would china be issuing debt in a foreign currency let alone the us dollar in the middle of the us china trade war the simple answer it s all about disassembling the bretton woods system that has the us dollar enshrined as the world s reserve currency this is all related to bretton woods in july the bretton woods system celebrated its 75th anniversary over the past 75 years the bretton woods system by and large enshrined the us dollar as the world s reserve currency having the power of the global unit of account the us dollar and thus the us economy is afforded a level of privilege that no other country on the planet enjoys the foundation of this unique economic and financial privilege has been the fact that the us economy has maintained at least a 25 share of global gdp in the post world war ii era in the 75 years since bretton woods yet the global economy is evolving rapidly particularly as countries in the west that dominated the 20th century are seeing declining birth rates and declining labor force participation rates countries in asia and africa are growing faster than their western counterparts in both population growth and productivity granted easy to do when you re bootstrapping technological progress as opposed to sitting on the edge of the technological frontier but still faster growth is faster growth it s not difficult to foresee the inevitable shift of power over the coming decades bretton woods institutions have failed to evolve in a manner that allows for greater cooperation among emerging market economies allowing china to push its one belt one road initiative as a new standard for global cooperation in doing so china is attempting to aggregate enough share of global gdp to allow the chinese yuan to take the mantle of the world reserve currency the us dollar and the us economy would lose the unique economic and financial privilege it s enjoyed for so many years and in turn reduced demand for us dollars as it would no longer be the sole unit of account if the unit of account at all would very likely see the us dollar decline in value read more 75 years later the lessons of bretton woods have been forgotten recall the early days of abenomics traders who have operated in markets since the global financial crisis may recall a similar news cycle for those that were not trading in 2012 and 2013 this may be an interest analogy to consider when examining the facts of why china is issuing usd denominated debt in late 2012 when shinzo abe became prime minister of japan for the second time he had done so on the back of a campaign that promised significant fiscal and monetary reform see the three arrows per the mundell fleming or balance of payments model of foreign exchange rate valuations the combined force of expansive monetary and expansive fiscal policy was priming the japanese yen for a long term downturn to take advantage of this forthcoming environment news stories leaked out that several large investors in europe and the united states were rolling over their debt from whatever currency it was issued into to jpy denominated debt none were more famous for doing so than american investor mark cuban why issue debt denominated in a foreign currency by issuing debt in a foreign currency in the case of abenomics the japanese yen investors like mark cuban were able to reduce their debt payments over time consider this your debt is now issued in jpy not usd when you issue this jpy denominated debt the usd jpy spot rate is 80 000 as an investor earning his or her income in us dollars you will have to convert to the japanese yen to repay their debt when the debt payments are due on year later the usd jpy spot rate is now 90 000 while the amount of jpy due to be repaid is the same it now takes fewer usd in order to pay back those jpy by issuing debt in a foreign currency you are making a bet that said currency will decline in value over time making it cheaper to pay back the debt just another sign that china is trying to end us dollar hegemony much like investors issuing debt in the japanese yen as abenomics began to take root china s decision to issue debt in us dollars at a record pace this year is a sign that it betting against the us dollar after all if china is successful in displacing the bretton woods system with it s own one belt one road initiative then the us dollar will lose its place as the world s reserve currency plummeting in value along the way it will be cheaper over time to pay back debt issued in us dollars as relatively speaking the chinese yuan strengthens over time which is why the us china trade war is not merely about how the trade relationship will be fixed in the short term it is part of a long term battle on china s part to displace the us dollar as the world reserve currency and china is betting they ll be successful fx trading resources whether you are a

while standing at the forefront of global economic crisis management the international monetary fund imf is a frequent target of criticism for its attempts to foster financial stability the imf s issues started at its birth in july 1944 in bretton woods new hampshire in the u s when industrial economies were in charge of shaping the postwar international monetary system and economic development was not their primary concern the bretton woods baby as it has been called was established to develop international competition and boost trade following world war ii and was seen as the central bank for a new era of international trade the imf s founding fathers focused on the enlargement of trade and investment believing this would be the best way to foster economic prosperity for all countries including developing ones the lifting of extensive restrictions on trade and payments enabling convertibility among currencies and retaining stability in exchange rates were considered milestones in this trade expansion over time developed countries especially the u s did not want to give the right of seigniorage profit from currency in short to an international organization leading the imf to become a body that changed its aim from fostering global trade to intervening in foreign debts growth and stability problems in less developed countries critics the imf has since been considered an instrument of the hegemony of money for many the institution s main function was seen as boosting developing countries dependence on american policies that guarantee the free movement of capital and profits worldwide the structural reforms proposed by the imf to developing countries during crisis periods in the less developed world further deepened catastrophes said erinç yeldan the head of the economics faculty at ankara s bilkent university he said the imf s comprehensive structural conditions especially for countries facing a liquidity crisis led international investors to make false and exaggerated assessments of the depth of the crisis many also argue that its approach in tackling economic problems in developing countries was based heavily on the implementation of best practice models that failed to take into account the complications of other settings as dani rodrik a distinguished turkish born economist at harvard university once said developing nations are different from advanced ones in that they face both greater challenges and more constraints the imf s role has also been criticized on several other fronts with yeldan in particular citing the 1997 asian economic crisis saying the fund s financial intervention then was misguided and one sided he said the imf had ignored the structural differences among countries by giving the same prescriptions to every failing country that knocked on its door blueprints for latin america and asia in the 1980s latin american countries reached a point where their foreign debt exceeded their earning power and inflation was quite high the imf s medicine for these problems was the implementation of fiscal austerity and tighter monetary policies a precondition for its financial support yet in 1997 when the imf called for the same demands for thailand this was considered a mistake unlike latin american countries east asian countries were already running budget surpluses and tight monetary policies according to joseph stiglitz the well known nobel laureate in economics although the far east did not suffer from the same economic woes its countries were offered the same cure by the imf the problem was not the imprudent government as in latin america the problem was an imprudent private sector all those bankers and borrowers for instance who d gambled on the real estate bubble stiglitz once said pointed questions after these painful experiences some questions were raised about the body s reform packages like does the conditional nature of imf programs reduce the flexibility of leaders and sabotage democratic accountability do democratic leaders scapegoat the imf to legislate policies that might be politically unattainable otherwise or are they truly powerless to battle against imf imposed policies it seems academics are still looking for answers to these questions and trying to figure out what affects a country s bargaining leverage vis a vis the imf according to stiglitz the imf likes to go about its business without outsiders asking too many questions in theory the fund supports democratic institutions in the nations it assists in practice it undermines the democratic process by imposing policies he said in an interview back in 2000 paul krugman another nobel laureate economist laid out the point of view many countries have toward the imf no one loves the imf if someone loved it that would be a bad sign since the imf is the final decision making authority governments only go to this institution when they get into trouble and the last thing you expect from the last resort institution is mercy could imf be more pragmatic in the aftermath of the 2007 2008 global financial crises the role of government in the economy grew with the implementation of keynesian policies such as government spending on infrastructure unemployment benefits and education in 2010 the world s controversial financial firefighter regained prominence with the emergence of the european sovereign debt crisis until that time much of the imf s money was sent to developing countries like argentina brazil and indonesia yet the european debt crisis for the first time required major bailouts in advanced eurozone economies including greece iceland ireland and portugal the european turmoil made it obvious that the imf s attitude toward europe s developed countries was not as hard as it was on less developed ones said yeldan he voiced another common criticism of the imf saying that these advanced economies also enjoyed imf financial support from time to time yet without the fund s structural straitjackets unable to remain indifferent to these criticisms the imf has recently made a series of reforms to lending conditions to low income countries focusing on country specific tailoring and an emphasis on poverty alleviation also the imf s latest review of conditionality finished in 2018 aimed to improve transparency and assess imf programs in a more timely manner according to yeldan under the leadership of bulgaria s kristalina georgieva the imf s new five year term president as of oct 1 from an emerging market the fund is expected to be more pragmatic taking into account the different fundamentals of countries and functioning as an advisory board alternatives despite the imf s efforts to boost its credibility some countries prefer knocking on the doors of other countries or writing their own prescriptions instead of asking the fund for help pakistan for example in 2018 looked for chinese and saudi loans before going to the imf turkey can also be cited as a good example since it shows why developing countries real world reformers sometimes try to steer clear of imf reform packages despite being the fund s most dedicated client over the past few decades under imf assisted programs turkey saw three notable financial crises along the way in 1994 2000 and 2001 some academics and politicians in the country considered imf bailouts a crisis ridden path and have been skeptical of imf structural reform packages in 2009 when the global financial crisis broke out for instance turkey declared that it could weather the storm without imf help and move forward without a crutch and indeed it did the country got over the crisis without looking for imf support and in 2013 moved to clear its remaining 864 million debt with the fund since then the government has made it repeatedly clear that the days of it going to the imf with cap in hand were gone for good

remarks by benoît cœuré member of the executive board of the ecb at the pse job forum paris school of economics it is a true pleasure to be back here at the paris school of economics pse you are now on the home stretch i well remember how i felt during my own final year excited anxious and curious all at once over the next few months you will need to take serious life changing decisions the data suggest there is about a two in three chance that you will pursue further studies for many a master s degree is a natural step towards a phd and a phd is essentially a promise of employment in the united states for example the unemployment rate for phd economists is about 0 8 the lowest among all sciences not a bad place to start from but a phd is not about financial optimisation estimates for the united kingdom suggest that british men with a master s degree earn 23 more than those who could have gone to university but chose not to the earnings premium for a phd which often takes three to five times as long is just 26 for some subjects the premium for a phd even vanishes entirely so first piece of advice your phd should be fuelled by your passion and your love for research rather than by hopes of earning more money money was clearly not the reason for me to join the labour market in 1992 when i graduated from pse with a master in analysis and policy in economics my first appointment took me to the national institute of statistics and economic studies or insee before i moved on to the french treasury and then in 2012 to the european central bank ecb the path that i chose to explore is just one of many that are open to you the good news is that the solid training you receive here at pse makes it your choice the world of economics is incredibly broad i will leave it to the participants of the two roundtables this evening to make a convincing case for their respective institutions although i would not be surprised if many of you take the lead from the english author g k chesterton who said i owe my success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice and then going away and doing the exact opposite but i wouldn t be here tonight if i hadn t planned to use this opportunity to make at least some publicity for the public sector working in the public sector working in the public sector and by this i mean ministries of economy and finance statistical institutes international organisations such as the imf world bank and other development banks oecd and central banks such as the us federal reserve or the european central bank is probably as close as it gets to applied economics it is literally about taking the models tools and methods that you learn at class to help design public policies a considerable fraction of that work then ends up being published as new research so there is a virtuous feedback loop between academia and public sector institutions say s law of markets doesn t necessarily apply to the market for ideas supply creates its own demand but demand also creates its own supply economists at the ecb for example have collectively published more than 2 300 working papers over the past 20 years an average of ten papers per month strictly speaking the vast majority of these economists are not research economists they are not paid to write papers they analyse the labour market or price developments or they design monetary policy instruments so to all intents and purposes their daily work is research the ecb is not the odd one out in this respect other public organisations work along exactly the same lines their collective research has a considerable impact on economics as a science for many economists it is this intellectual curiosity this ability and opportunity to push out the frontier of innovation that makes institutions like the ecb such an attractive place to work the us anthropologist david graeber has claimed that some 40 of workers secretly believe that their jobs need not or should not exist i have a strong sense that this number is considerably smaller for public sector economists but i cannot prove it what i can prove to you however is the relevance of what you learn here at pse for the work in an organisation like the ecb central banks as workplace monetary policy is a branch of the economics profession that has particularly close ties to your master s curriculum richard clarida jordi galí and mark gertler famously dissected the science of monetary policy even though many central bankers would also call monetary policy an art macroeconomic models underpin almost all of our work at the ecb this model dependence owes much to how modern central banks define their mandate and to how monetary policy transmits to the economy the ecb for example aims at preserving price stability over the medium term that is we define our mission in a forward looking manner and this forward looking perspective reflects the fact that it takes time we often say around two to three years in some cases maybe more for our decisions to affect prices so whenever we decide on monetary policy we must think of where we see the economy going in two to three years time the forward looking nature of monetary policy makes the use of models indispensable some of the models we use are very simple the phillips curve being a case in point phillips curves are simple a single equation to forecast inflation conditional on our best guess as to where the economy is heading as such they are important in our assessment of whether policy needs change but there are many ways to draw a phillips curve it can be linear or convex it can explain price or wage inflation it can be based on the unemployment rate or on the output gap or on broader measures of economic slack and so on equally important however are models that help us quantify the impact of our own decisions on prices growth and financial conditions these models can be very complex without them we would be unable to calibrate our policies for a long time calibrating policy was a relatively straightforward exercise because there was only one key policy instrument the interest rate at which commercial banks could borrow from the central bank but in recent years monetary policy operations have become much more complex the ecb currently provides monetary accommodation through a broad and complementary set of measures we have lowered our key interest rates into negative territory we purchase private and public securities and we explicitly communicate our expectations as to where we see our policy rate in the near future forward guidance in central bank speak it would take a full speech to explain how these measures work in practice let me give you an example when we started purchasing securities we had no guidance other than the experience of other central banks as to how many bonds we would need to buy to bring inflation back to our aim of below but close to 2 over time ecb staff have successfully filled this void we now have state of the art term structure models that help translate changes in the amount of bonds into changes in long term interest rates we know from event studies how policy announcements translate into asset price movements we have built models of bank intermediation that tell us how tighter funding conditions will impact on bank lending that s for the science behind it and that s when art or rather artisanat craftsmanship comes in we need to interconnect these models and fit them into a general equilibrium view of how the euro area economy evolves dynamically preferably in a tractable way we need to know when expert judgment rather than empirical estimation has been used and when this is all done we should be able to keep track of the key assumptions we have used and take some distance to quote from abhijit banerjee and esther duflo we the economists are often wrapped up in our models and our methods and sometimes forget where science ends and ideology begins we answer policy questions based on assumptions that have become second nature to us because they are the building blocks of our models but it doesn t mean that they are always correct we owe this transparency to ourselves as policymakers and to society as a whole when we communicate our decisions we don t want to prove right joan robinson s remark that the purpose of studying economics is to learn how to avoid being deceived by economists economics as a profession these examples say a lot about our profession they inspire at least four additional pieces of advice that i would like to pass on first uncertainty is a pervasive feature of our profession a first instance of uncertainty is the parameters of our models to illustrate let s go back to the phillips curve the missing inflation episode of recent years has stirred intense debates on whether the phillips curve still provides valuable policy advice today according to conventional phillips curve estimates inflation today should be measurably higher this raises all sorts of questions that my colleagues are now exploring did globalisation change the relationship between domestic output and inflation is there an amazon effect that is is inflation lower because people can buy cheaper online does workers bargaining power depend on traditional narrow measures of unemployment or on broader ones including underemployment does it depend on the quality of jobs being created and so on none of these questions have been settled our best answer to these challenges today is to look at a range of some 600 phillips curves to quantify the uncertainty around our baseline outlook another instance of uncertainty is the nature of the shocks hitting our economies should we decide our policies on the assumption that future outcomes will be normally distributed around some expected average how risk adverse should we be when considering this distribution or in other words should we conduct policy on the basis of expected outcomes or with a view to minimising losses in extreme scenarios as we request banks to do when we run our stress tests so monetary policy has a lot to do with risk management as does the economics profession more generally economists need to be humble when articulating policy every baseline is surrounded by large uncertainty bands and tails can be very fat second perhaps the defining challenge for our profession is that our understanding of the economy is never settled we cannot blindly trust in models even if they have been running for a long time every model is a vastly simplified representation of economic reality which incurs the risk of misspecification and may result in inadequate policy guidance misspecification or model uncertainty is different from parameter uncertainty take the recent financial crisis as example i often hear the criticism that economists failed to predict the outbreak of the financial crisis this criticism is nonsense or do we expect physicians to predict illnesses we don t of course but we expect them to help us cure illnesses economists should do the same they should be judged by the quality of the advice they give in this sense the crisis exposed at least three shortcomings in central bank models the most apparent limitation was the absence of a meaningful financial sector which left models at a loss to explain the origins of the crisis and its consequences for the economy the second limitation was that the prevailing models were built on a standard linear gaussian set up and hence proved inadequate to examine shocks on the scale of the global financial crisis and the third limitation was that the models did not take into account the lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates a constraint which started to bind just a few months after the beginning of the crisis and that helps to explain for example why fiscal multipliers have been underestimated in the aftermath of the crisis with tragic social consequences the implication is that our models require regular review and scrutiny in order to remain useful for decision making few models are valid for eternity the ecb employs around 400 economists that constantly help develop and improve macroeconomic models for decision makers we also have our own think tank which cooperates closely with academia and that provides cutting edge research on various monetary policy topics thanks to them and others our general equilibrium models now feature a fully fledged banking sector that accounts for the presence of financial frictions and that also allows us to analyse the effects of macroprudential policies other models address non linearities and deal with heterogeneity across countries and economic agents and don t forget that central banking is not only about macro level phenomena bank and financial markets supervisors have to make sense of the complex mesh of principal agent relationships between lenders borrowers and financial intermediaries and to make these contracts incentive compatible this requires quite an amount of international organisation and contract theory think of say the seminal work by jean charles rochet and jean tirole on credit card schemes as two sided markets which we still use today to understand the fast changing world of retail payments policymakers are often caught between a rock and a hard place between the risk of providing too little insurance and let the economy be scarred by shocks and providing too much of it and create moral hazard in contract theory parlance we have to manage trade offs between ex ante and ex post incentives this applies to issues as diverse as liquidity regulation or the optimal design of some of our monetary policy instruments such as the outright monetary transactions all of this is work in progress ultimately the success of policy will always depend on the quality of our models and the efforts we invest in keeping them up to date and we ll always benefit from drawing from a portfolio of models and comparing their different answers to our questions models are not there to tell the truth but to help structure the conversation on policies and identify key assumptions to quote again from banerjee and duflo the most valuable thing economists have to share is often not their conclusion but the path they took to reach it as general eisenhower once said plans are worthless but planning is everything third there are no settled answers to applied questions economics is an empirical science better and increased data and a parallel rise in computing power means we now have answers to questions that we could not answer 30 years ago large dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models the ones that failed to incorporate financial frictions require the use of involved numerical methods to produce an estimate of the posterior distribution when confronted with the data advances in computing power have allowed the estimation of such models greatly expanding the tools central banks have at hand to analyse the economy yet current conventional estimation methods still imply many hours or even days of estimation of more complex models that include household and firm heterogeneity your generation will push out the modelling frontier even farther no doubt parallel and cloud computing machine learning and artificial intelligence are already transforming the economics profession you will all need to keep up with the pace of technological progress economics is life long learning many of the methods and software packages you learn today will be outdated by the time you are mid way through your career at the same time big data and richer and timelier datasets will help improve the input to our models the billion prices project which was launched by the massachusetts institute of technology mit in 2008 publishes daily online price indices for more than 20 countries where price information is collected automatically through machines from hundreds of retailers i would hazard a guess that you will look back with pity on the current generation of economists who have only just started using online and scanner data to improve our short term forecasts the sky is the limit and fourth structural changes perhaps contribute most to making the economics profession exciting but also challenging if you had been working in the ecb s monetary policy department in 2014 you would have more than likely contributed to the work on the term structure models i have alluded to previously or on financial frictions and euro area heterogeneity but if you come to work in the ecb s monetary policy department in 2021 you will probably be working on the consequences of fintech for financial intermediation or on the impact of trade wars and dislocating global value chains on price and output spillovers in the global economy your studies today will equip you with the tools to approach such challenges in the future but you will have to use these tools very flexibly and with an open mind climate change is perhaps the most far reaching of the challenges facing your generation it is no coincidence that william nordhaus was awarded the nobel prize in economic sciences last year for integrating climate change into macroeconomic analysis central banks are lagging behind the curve and have only just started incorporating the effects of climate change into their models your generation will need to be the driving force behind these efforts central banks cannot be at the forefront in fighting climate change this is and should remain a political task but they can help within their mandates low and even negative interest rates have implicitly contributed to shorten the tragedy of the horizon that is lower discount rates have increased the net present value of those future cash flows that are more likely to be affected by climate change at any rate climate change will affect the conduct of monetary policy in one way or another without further mitigation for example it will become increasingly difficult for central banks to disentangle the variation in the data underlying the assessment of the medium term inflation outlook consider the german car manufacturing sector which has experienced a notable decline in activity over the past 18 months or so this decline started after the implementation of new carbon dioxide emission standards but it coincided with a broad based decline in global aggregate demand due to growing uncertainties about global trade and brexit these effects have very different implications for central banks monetary policy is the appropriate tool to counter weakness in demand so as to keep inflation at levels that are in line with our aim but monetary policy is not the right tool for addressing a decline in production that reflects a change in consumer preferences away from fossil fuel driven cars and towards electrical vehicles central banks will face such identification issues more often in the future and they will need to think about how they incorporate green and sustainable considerations in their investment behaviour the research field is wide and open in this area but it is also full of challenges for this reason and because climate change is an emergency work on modelling climate change will require strong international collaboration across national and international organisations if we want to be successful then we need to start now conclusion no matter what you take home from tonight and with this i would like to conclude as you go out into the world and start your careers take with you the great experiences and the network of people that this university has on offer life and economics is about people keep those friendships going not only for your careers but for your own wellbeing and to help you become exemplary members of our societies and stay humble and critical equations and models often induce a false sense of omnipotence listen to your hearts and conscience always keep in mind that economics is a social science models will not take away the burden and responsibility of making judgements economics involves much trial and error you have to take decisions in the fog when you can barely see your hand in front of your face this makes our profession exciting with this in mind i wish you the best of luck thank you
protest stricken lebanon has vowed to repay 1 5bn to holders of its government debt as planned this week despite a stalled economy and drained dollar reserves but economists say the time has come to consider letting investors down lebanon s central bank governor riad salameh speaks during an interview with reuters at his office in central bank in beirut lebanon october 24 2017 reuters jamal saidi rc1d7b748890 with total borrowing of 88 4bn lebanon has one of the world s biggest debt burdens projected to be 155 per cent of gross domestic product by the end of 2019 but it has always met payments to creditors a crucial step in maintaining investors trust and ensuring long term access to international markets now as the protests over corruption and joblessness enter their second month some analysts and economists are warning that imports should take precedence over bond obligations urging the government to delay repayments or devise another way to spread the pain they can reschedule this debt with a cheaper eurobond issuance not actually paying it but rescheduling it said jad chaaban a professor of economy at the american university of beirut lebanon s debt has piled up as the government has continued to spend more than it brings in and remittances from the country s diaspora have slowed last year the deficit was about 11 per cent of gdp with the economic situation worsening the country could ask its creditors to accept delayed or smaller repayments rather than continuing to pay punishingly high interest rates according to camille abousleiman a lawyer who has worked on lebanon s foreign debt issuances and is the caretaker minister of labour lebanon is in reasonably good shape to negotiate a restructuring he said nasser saidi a former central bank vice governor said he expected the central bank would be able to provide the foreign currency needed to cover thursday s repayment pointing out that not all the funds would automatically flow overseas he estimated that over two thirds of the 1 5bn owed would remain in the country as the debt is already held by local lenders and the central bank the balance to foreign investors can be covered from existing reserves he said for years the central bank headed by riad salameh has functioned as the government s financier helping the administration to access foreign currency to meet its repayment obligations when necessary mr salameh has run the banque du liban for over 25 years and his self described financial engineering often involving complicated asset swap operations with the country s commercial banks has often helped to steer lebanon s government and banking sector through difficult times but economists are increasingly concerned that such strategies will no longer be sufficient in october amid the worsening economic climate the central bank introduced a facility to guarantee access to dollars for critical imports accelerating the depletion of the state s foreign exchange reserves which fell by 900m in the first week of november at that rate lebanon s foreign exchange reserves would run out by the middle of 2020 according to a stark analysis published by bank of america on monday the central bank says its gross international reserves are around 30bn but analysts say it would be hard immediately to access that full amount ratings agency moody s puts the central bank s usable foreign exchange buffer at 5bn to 10bn and calculates that external debt service payments this year and next year will cost a combined 6 5bn in addition to facilitating government borrowing the central bank is currently providing dollar liquidity to commercial banks through high interest dollar loans is now lending to the government and the commercial banks so it has to make decisions about how it uses its remaining reserves said mr chaaban at the american university of beirut ultimately the bdl may have to decide whether it continues to help the government to service its external debt or focuses on easing the plight of the country s cash strapped importers mr salameh one of the world s longest serving central bank chiefs has so far insisted he can do both in more than two decades when he has served as the bdl s governor lebanon has never defaulted and the official exchange rate remained fixed at 1 507 lebanese pounds to the dollar until this summer s drop but the current dollar shortage has caused the unofficial exchange rate to fall by 20 per cent since august while the loss of normal banking services has left many companies unable to renew stocks or pay employees full salaries the extraordinary measures taken by the bdl and banks are buying time at the cost of a contraction in economic activity the bank of america research note said pointing to efforts by various banks to limit customer withdrawals the country s predicament is complicated by the absence of an elected government to lead negotiations on a comprehensive restructuring of its debt prime minister saad hariri resigned early this month in response to the protests and so far there has been little progress in forming a new government that would meet demonstrators demands but former labour minister mr abousleiman argued that the interim administration has the authority to lead such discussions and has an obligation to act the caretaker government can constitutionally and should deal with the crisis he said they cannot abandon ship financial times
this is ai generated summarization which may have errors for context always refer to the full article china s economic relationship with the global south may be overall positive but beijing needs to address the questionable practices of its corporations and agencies part 1 china an imperial power in the image of the west part 2 capitalism with chinese characteristics part 3 china s economy powerful yes but vulnerable part 4 china s rulers and its restive people in just 25 years since it has gone out to the world china has become a superpower in global trade investment and lending by 2017 it had become the world s top trader with its imports and exports valued at 4 1 trillion or 12 4 of global trade china has quickly become one of the world s top investors its cumulative stock of foreign investment coming to over 900 billion with most of it in developed countries it is on track to displace japan as the world s biggest net creditor with a significant portion of its assets in the form of development finance for economies in the global south when it comes to trade china s role is overwhelmingly a plus for developing countries its demand for food and raw materials has opened up an alternative market for countries of the south that had been mainly dependent on the us europe and japan before the 2000 s trade with china however has not been an unalloyed good since its cheap manufactures have contributed to making many local industries especially in developing countries that already had a dynamic manufacturing sector many economists have cautioned however against blaming chinese imports as the cause of industrial decline since structural adjustment programs pushed by the world bank and the international monetary fund had already destroyed much of local manufacturing before chinese goods arrived in earnest in the 1990s development finance china fills a vacuum when it comes to development finance china has also been overwhelmingly a plus for developing countries in the much needed area of infrastructure building where there is said to be an grossly unmet need of some 3 trillion china offers practically the sole source of financing for many countries since western led financing for development has been stagnant for years now and western agencies such as the world bank and the imf attach neoliberal conditionalities that impede development china as kevin gallagher notes wryly is now the world s largest development bank two of its agencies the china development bank and the china export import bank have provided nearly a trillion dollars worth of financing to foreign countries since the early 2000 s the overall positive role of china s expansion in the global south has however been clouded by criticisms of investment by chinese state enterprises which is often linked to chinese financing for development chinese development loans are said to carry higher rates of interest than loans from japan or the western dominated multilateral development banks many projects are faulted for aiding dictatorial regimes yielding benefits only for local elites disregarding labor rights and promoting damage to the environment there is no doubt that many of these criticisms are valid chinese loans do carry a higher interest burden chinese have lent to dictatorial regimes the chinese funded myitsone dam in myanmar would have destabilized communities of the kachin ethnic minority had it not been stopped by the myanmar government ngo s have also shown that the chinese financed kamchay dam in cambodia and energy infrastructure projects in ghana have mainly benefited dominant elites and in zimbabwe zambia the democratic republic of congo and south africa chinese firms both state run and private have been associated with abusive treatment of local workers and a preference for employing imported chinese labor countervailing considerations these criticisms must however be placed within a broader picture first of all on the question of the interest burden of chinese loans while it is true that chinese loans carry an interest rate above those that accompany loans from the world bank regional development banks and bilateral donors like japan china has also engaged in many acts of debt forgiveness or debt cancellation this year 2019 it has written off 78 million debt owed by cameroon in 2018 it wrote off 72 million owed by botswana and 10 6 million owed by lesotho and in 2017 160 million worth of debt owed by sudan the rhodium research group found 40 instances of renegotiations of debts to china amounting to 50 billion across 24 countries since 2000 in his 2010 un millennium challenge speech then prime minister wen jiabao revealed that china canceled debt owed by 50 heavily indebted poor countries hipcs and least developed countries ldcs worth 25 6 billion yuan 3 8 billion as of 2009 and would cancel more in 2010 similarly in 2018 xi jinping said durint the forum on china africa cooperation that china would write off some interest free loans to africa s poorest nations second on the issue of chinese loans and investments helping to prop up dictatorial regimes while there are instances where this is true the claim does not seem to hold as a general rule investigation by julia bader has in fact come out with the counterintuitive finding that china s economic cooperation appears to have unexpected positive effects for democratization that is the level of chinese aid is positively correlated with transitions to democracy this is obviously an issue that must be probed further third while in certain cases chinese funded projects do exacerbate inequality global macroeconomic data indicate that chinese lending offers not only alternative finance but alternative finance that tends to reduce inequality research by a transnational consortium of analysts from leading us and german universities found that chinese development projects in particular connective infrastructure projects like roads and bridges are found to create a more equal distribution of economic activity within the provinces and districts where they were located the study also measured the impact of chinese development projects on economic inequality between provinces and districts and here too the results provide grounds for optimism chinese government financed projects appear to reduce rather than widen economic disparities between regions while there is no macro correlation between chinese projects and rising inequality there is no doubt about the fact that imf and world bank funded structural adjustment programs with their harsh neoliberal conditionalities led to a sharp rise in inequality and poverty among their recipients in the 1980 s and 1980 s fourth while china s state enterprises are often assumed to pollute the environment more intensively than western corporations there is in fact conflicting evidence on whether this is true certainly western companies engaged in extractive and related activities such as the australian canadian mining giant oceana gold in el salvador and the philippines have records that would compare with if not surpass in notoriety those of chinese firms moreover western transnational firms have increasingly taken to subcontracting their cheap labor and polluting operations to enterprises in developing countries so that the comprehensive global impact of their value chains in terms of labor exploitation and environmental pollution in the africa latin america and asia outside china is probably much greater than those of a limited number of chinese state enterprises it has been shown for instance that carbon emissions arising from the global supply chains of the european pharmaceutical industry are about ten times as high as its emissions from direct operations a similar picture is observed for water consumption about three times as high and air pollution twenty times as high also in the countries included in china s belt and road initiative bri demand from us and eu consumers is said to be responsible for 30 of the carbon emissions in bri countries through embodied carbon flows not in same league as the west indeed for all their complaints about the behavior of chinese state enterprises in their countries many people in developing countries do not place china in the same category as western corporations looking closely at the depictions of china in both the government controlled and opposition press in a number of african countries one of the more even handed studies of china s role in the continent found that african media have criticized chinese individuals and corporations for bad behavior a few zimbabwean news articles were found to accuse china of neo colonialism or portray china as an economic threat and some south african and zambian media articles have criticized their governments for being too friendly with china but most articles have not portrayed china an evil empire out to exploit africa although china gets its share of criticism in the african media apart from a few exceptions the african press did not see china as a neo imperialist nor did they paint the chinese in racist colors these perceptions may however change if china does not make moves to correct its mistakes and allows questionable practices its corporations and agencies made in its first 25 years of the country s opening up to the world to persist countries that previously were willing to give china space to make mistakes owing to the fact that it was on a steep learning curve may no longer be as tolerant in the next few years changing questionable or bad behavior will not be easy but unless china acts soon these behaviors can congeal into structural patterns similar to those displayed by western corporations these structures can then become the mechanisms and avenues of domination should a leadership seeking global hegemony emerge in china glimmers of hope is it realistic to expect change rather than give a definite yes or no one might point to a possible sign of progress like all member countries in the united nations china is subjected to a universal periodic review upr of its record on human rights in the 2018 upr it is noteworthy that while china simply noted many recommendations for improving its human rights behavior coming from western countries it accepted a number affecting the conduct of its corporations abroad that were filed by developing countries like kenya ecuador haiti and palestine specifically it agreed to promote measures to ensure that development and infrastructure projects inside and outside its territory were fully consistent with human rights and respect the environment and the sustainability of natural resources consider the establishment of a legal framework to guarantee that activities carried out by industries subject to its jurisdiction do not negatively impact human rights abroad take measures on business and human rights in line with its international obligations and ensure that companies operating in high risk or conflict areas conduct human rights due diligence in line with the guiding principles on business and human rights and establish a regulatory framework to assess the human rights and environmental impacts of corporations headquartered in china so as to promote and respect human rights these concessions may seem minor but they do provide developing countries with a yardstick with which to make china s state and private corporate entities accountable in their activities abroad these may turn out to be rhetorical commitments but then they could also be the beginnings of a major effort by china not to follow in the footsteps of the west in its relationship with the global south it takes two to tango and china s partners in the global south will have a critical role to play in making china behave and change rappler com this is the fifth of seven articles on the china s political economy based on the study titled china an imperial power in the image of the west published by focus on the global south and authored by walden bello retired professor at the

armine yalnizyan is an economist and the atkinson fellow on the future of workers as economic forecasts continue to downgrade global growth prospects policy makers fixation with boosting growth remains well fixed meanwhile concerns about stubbornly high levels of inequality have triggered a growing chorus of calls including from the organisation for economic co operation and development the international monetary fund and the world bank for more inclusive growth the opening question faced by 900 or so attendees at the canadian tax foundation s annual conference in montreal on sunday is a testament to the tension of our times do tax policies that contribute to competitiveness also create inequality as a panelist wrestling with this question i m wondering what is meant by competitiveness more innovation or simply more capital lower taxes may attract more capital although that s not guaranteed and three cautionary tales reveal how more cash may not produce advances in productive capacity through technology or knowledge the legend of zero economists remind us that corporations don t pay taxes people do so is the ideal corporate tax policy rate zero putting aside the fact that would mean canada would need to replace about 50 billion in federal revenues cut 50 billion in services or some combination thereof it is instructive to look at the 12 nations that currently offer zero corporate taxes all are tax shelters and most such as bermuda and the bahamas are more playgrounds for the rich than hubs of innovation and development on the flip side countries with the highest corporate tax rates both attract and repel capital inflows the united arab emirates tops the list at 55 per cent but countries as disparate as brazil india france and japan not to mention chad venezuela and many others have corporate tax rates of more than 30 per cent taxes aren t the key reason for huge differences in rates of growth and investment concentrating market power canada enjoyed a clear tax advantage over the united states between 2002 and 2017 but u s president donald trump s sweeping package of tax reforms makes the advantage less clear steep permanent corporate tax cuts large if temporary personal income tax cuts and incentives to repatriate capital to the u s are game changing considerations what kind of investments did this newly found competitive edge on taxes buy in the u s a us 1 1 trillion surge in share buybacks slower growth rates in productivity and job creation and between us 1 trillion and us 2 trillion in additional public debt by 2025 lower taxes less investment canada s corporate tax rate was cut almost in half from 2000 to 2012 and cuts to personal income tax rates resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in forgone revenue yet business investments account for the same share of gross domestic product gdp today as in 2000 machinery equipment and intellectual property account for less business investment than they did in 2000 just as in the u s since 2017 have u s tax cuts siphoned foreign investment away from canada both inbound and outbound foreign direct investments are up in canada but outbound flows have risen faster possibly more because of trends in globally set oil and commodity prices than taxes tax levels are rarely the first consideration for investors unless the investment is a tax dodge for any business operation regulations matter proximity to markets matter and so do community features such as a healthy and well educated work force well maintained infrastructure reliable energy transportation and communications systems and a robust justice system backed by widely trusted social institutions when these things are equal between locations taxes will decide where to invest but these things are not usually equal and it s the differences that distinguish places as people and money magnets or not that insight offers a big clue about why tax policies matter tax policies can increase competition by reducing taxes or by funding what makes whole systems work tax policies shape the nature of growth which determines how much is needed for redistribution and how much for expanding innovation unless competition is code for less government and tax policies is code for tax cuts the question we should be asking is how to make our tax policies contribute to the drive toward inclusive growth what tax policies best share the costs and benefits of inevitable growth decline and transition what tax levels and tax designs provide the basics for everyone minimizing the burden while maximizing individual well being and resilience built on a foundation of excellent physical and social infrastructure in all communities competitiveness and equality are not diametrically opposed goals for decades policy makers have used tax policy to drive growth paying less attention to the deeply lopsided ways in which society carved up that bigger pie why not bake in the missing ingredient inclusive growth so that tax policies yield a better tasting recipe for everyone
the imf is reviewing its approach to unorthodox central bank tools such as currency intervention and capital flow management as it looks to create a modern policy framework that better reflects the needs of developing economies in a more integrated global market system the move marks a departure from its traditional role as an advocate of conventional monetary policy the fund is in talks with a number of countries finance ministers and central banks to devise a new integrated policy framework david lipton first deputy managing director of the imf tells euromoney our aim is that over time we will be able to have a more complete playbook to help he says our advice will be to countries that are free sailing in choppy waters which is different to a programme or a crisis a lot of the work we are doing is focused on macro prudential tools and capital flow measures to modulate the breadth of the likely outcomes and avoid extreme booms and busts these markets are so big that even a sizeable intervention won t make a huge difference david lipton imf free markets a liberalized exchange rate and an open economy have been central tenets of the imf s advice on monetary policy since the fund was formed in 1945 but greater dollarization and integration of financial markets has meant that smaller economies are now more exposed than ever to global market forces prompting a re think on its advice
impact of trade wars on global growth news and analysis politicians officials and academics are lining up to warn that trump s trade wars are reducing the flow of imports and exports many also believe that trump s trade policies are damaging global economic growth for the financial markets fears of the impact have seen stocks and currency prices take a hit trump s trade wars and the global economy evidence is mounting that us president donald trump s trade disputes with countries and regions including china and the eu are reducing global trade flows and thereby having a harmful impact on economic growth worldwide the international monetary fund for one is in little doubt the global economy is in a synchronized slowdown and we are once again downgrading growth for 2019 to 3 its slowest pace since the global financial crisis according to the imf s gita gopinath growth continues to be weakened by rising trade barriers and increasing geopolitical tensions we estimate that the us china trade tensions will cumulatively reduce the level of global gdp by 0 8 by 2020 she added the imf is certainly not alone european council president donald tusk said at the start of the august summit of the group of seven leading industrialized nations that escalating trade tensions between trump and other world leaders risk throwing the world into recession bemoaning senseless disputes that had ripped countries apart this may be the last moment to restore our political community he added global activity trade indicators source imf us china trade war a brief history of trade wars 1900 until present trade wars are good this link between trade conflicts and slower global growth is naturally not trump s opinion in 2018 he wrote on twitter that when a country usa is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with trade wars are good and easy to win moreover from a simplistic textbook perspective there is no reason why reduced trade flows should hurt economic growth one of the first equations students of economics learn is that y c i g x m where y is the national income measure of the size of an economy c is consumption i is investment g is government spending x is exports and m is imports it therefore follows that if exports and imports both decline by similar amounts there is no impact on the size of the economy or gdp gross domestic product however the federal reserve noted in the minutes of its federal open market committee meeting in september that trade tensions could affect us interest rates market participants remained attentive to a range of global risk factors that could affect the policy rate path including trade tensions between the united states and china it said the fed noted too that trade policy concerns continued to weigh on firms investment decisions and that trade tariffs pointed toward continued softness in factory output in coming months if the fed is right then trump s trade policies could weaken economic growth by reducing the investment component of gdp even though that could be offset by further cuts in us interest rates world trade outlook indicator source world trade organization trump s trade wars and the financial markets for the financial markets the impact so far has been largely psychological as headlines have hit the screens suggesting a worsening of trade tensions money has tended to flow from higher yielding riskier assets into lower zero or even negative yielding safe havens like gold us treasury bonds and german bunds signs of a deal have sent money in the opposite direction however both hard official data and soft survey data suggesting a negative impact on economic growth have also begun to emerge the institute for supply management ism reported that economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted in september and that global trade remains the most significant issue as demonstrated by the contraction in new export orders that began in july 2019 overall it added sentiment in september remained cautious regarding near term growth us retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in september suggesting that

bourse originated in 12th century france entities labelled as courretiers de change handled and oversaw agricultural communities debt under the service of french banks historians see this as the first example of a brokerage since the courretiers de change traded debts nevertheless the first market that resembled the stock market today began in the 1600 s it was a time when european countries sailed east and explored the world while monarchies funded some expeditions many ship owners relied on investors to pay for boats and crews in return investors got a part of the expedition s proceeds this is how the first publicly traded company known as the dutch east india was born the company sold bonds and shares to the general public every investor was entitled to a certain percentage of dutch east india s profits there was demand for shares because the company had been granted monopoly on the dutch spice trade however risk was still involved because pirates and bad weather could adversely

wealth to investors it can also bring powerful nations to its knees here are the top five stock market crashes in recent history stock market crash 1929 the 1929 stock market crash was fueled by greed before the collapse people invested in equities not because of fundamentals but because of rising stock prices brokers exploited this sentiment by selling stocks on margin with a ratio of 1 3 this meant that an investor only needed to pay 1 for every 3 worth of stocks they bought the downside of margin trading was that investor s capital was wrecked if the invested stock lost a third of its value margin trading drove higher prices which in turn attracted more investors eventually the system could no longer sustain the ascent and prices began to drop panic ensued on october 29 1929 as investors dumped shares in fear entire portfolios were wiped out as the new york stock exchange lost 14 billion in one day 1987 stock market crash an amalgamation of global conditions led to the dow jones industrial average djia suffering the worst day in its history in terms of percentage loss on october 19 1987 also known as the black monday 1987 the dow plunged by 22 6 percent experts point to various causes of the crash including a weakening us economy plummeting oil prices and the spat between the us and iran 1997 asian financial crisis in the summer of 1997 thailand s debt was rapidly spiraling out of control foreign investors took notice and lost confidence in the country s currency capital outflow was also experienced in neighboring countries such as the philippines malaysia south korea and indonesia as investors turned pessimistic as a result international stock markets nosedived by as much as 60 percent dot com bubble in the late 1990s people were over exuberant on the commercialization of the internet venture capitalists as well as retail investors threw money at internet based companies dot coms regardless of their fundamentals almost everyone assumed that any company running online would turn a profit the overconfidence created a bubble that began to burst when tech companies dell and cisco dumped shares in large quantities this triggered panic selling and within a few months companies with market capitalization of millions of dollars lost all value by 2002 the dot com bubble wiped out 5 trillion 2008 global financial crisis what caused the stock market crash in 2008 in simple terms greed in technical terms the deregulation of the financial industry the deregulation allowed banks to sell mortgages to hedge funds hedge funds then bundled these mortgages into securities and sold them to investors investors snatched these mortgage backed securities as the perceived notion was that they virtually have no risk these securities were insured by large companies such as the american international group aig under credit default swaps to supercharge profits banks wanted to give out more mortgages regardless of a home buyer s credit status more mortgages meant more profits from selling to hedge funds hedge funds embraced more mortgages since they could sell more to investors the cycle continued until almost all institutions such as pension funds banks and ordinary investors owned mortgage backed securities the dominoes fell in july 2008 when the housing market started to decline in value due to oversupply homeowners who couldn t meet mortgage payments found it difficult to sell their homes when mortgage holders failed to make payments the housing market bubble burst this ignited the banking crisis where large banks such as the lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy the shockwaves of the crisis led to the stock market crash of 2008 black swan events copy link to section black swan events in stock markets are events that happen

cause of a crash or selloff doesn t matter much the lesson is that selloffs happen with regularity when trading risk management is important especially if short term trading and a significant decline could decimate the account if long stocks and prices start to fall get out at a pre determined level or with a pre determined method while prices may eventually recover they may not do so within the timeframe you require the crash of 1987 started with several smaller declines which would have gotten short term traders out of most of their long positions before the major selloff on black monday investors holding long term positions need to continually take inventory of how stocks are valued and consider whether they will hold their stocks through a significant decline should one arise one factor to consider is that when stock prices are high relative to the earnings those companies produce there is a greater risk of a significant and sustained crash in 1987 stocks were not priced that high relative to earnings leading to a fairly quick recovery following the 87 crash stock prices moved higher into 2000 by 2000 stocks were valued at insanely high levels leading to a larger and longer crash this shows that while price to earnings ratios provide some insight into whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued by historical standards the ratio is a not a timing indicator as stocks can stay over or undervalued for long periods of time it also shows that even when stocks are seemingly priced low or fairly significant selloffs can still occur source www multpl com what p e does help with is assessing whether to hold an investment if stock prices start declining the chart above is a schiller p e ratio which also considers inflation if stocks are undervalued already it is more likely that eventually stocks will return to average or overvalued and can be sold for a profit if stocks are excessively overvalued then there is a greater risk that the stock may never reach its prior highs or will take many years even decades to recover the losses it sustains during a crash when dealing with individual stocks the prospects of that company must also be assessed a fair or in some cases high p e in a stock with stable or rising earnings is more attractive than a stock with a temporarily nice p e where earnings are in a long term decline price is not the only factor to consider the future of earnings must also be considered long term investment is not to be confused with short term trading short term traders should always cut losses swiftly and mechanically per their strategy regardless of how they think the stock is valued longer term investors may hold stocks through declines if they believe in the future prospects of the company and they purchased the stock at a reasonable price which will likely be surpassed could take months or years after the crash ends and prices begin to rise again as mentioned paying an excessively high price for a stock could mean the price never recovers its former glory or lofty price shorter term traders can trade in the trending direction regardless of value but must exit losing trades quickly especially if in a volatile or highly speculative asset such an approach greatly reduces the chances of being caught in the major portion of a market crash bottom line copy link to section stock trading is a concept that s over 400 years old in that span of time we ve seen horrible crashes that altered the history of the modern world nevertheless stock markets always recover just look at the trillion dollar

fully re imposed its maximum sanctions against iran the economy of the islamic republic has experienced impact but survives photo by ahmad halabisaz xinhua by mu dong hassan rouhvand tehran nov 27 xinhua one year since the united states fully re imposed its maximum sanctions against iran its economy has experienced impact but survives when the united states quit the iran nuclear deal officially known as joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa in may 2018 and then re imposed nuclear sanctions in august and november 2018 there was an expectation among u s decision makers that the iranian economy would collapse within months but while the sanctions have indeed severely undermined the iranian economy there are no signs of its collapse in washington s maximum pressure campaign against iran the u s has not only re imposed all sanctions waived under the jcpoa but has also added numerous further sanctions the sanctions resulted in decline in oil and gas export revenues which caused direct and indirect negative consequences for iranian government finances when the sanctions were started the government faced big budget deficit this year iran has resorted to remedies to reduce the fiscal vulnerabilities and balance the budget a number of reforms have been initiated including a reduction of the dependence on oil revenues an increase in tax revenues and a revamp of subsidies as the reforms require a few years to improve the government s financial position short term remedies have been applied that will help the country survive the sanctions truly it s too early to measure the success of all the moves but iran s strategy in response to the u s maximum pressure has been to offer proactive resistance the initial shocks have been overcome and economic indicators show a positive outlook iran s economy has survived the u s sanctions and has had a stabilizing trend following a period of instability said saeed laylaz an iranian analyst of political economy after the western and international sanctions against iran were lifted in 2016 by implementing the jcpoa iran experienced an economic growth over 10 percent according to the international monetary fund imf however the trend was sharply declined as u s president donald trump pulled the united states out of the deal and his administration subsequently imposed broad unilateral sanctions against tehran targeting nearly most vital sectors of iran s economy the expert pointed out the u s move alongside europe s sluggishness in facilitating iran s banking transactions and its oil exports prompted iran to renege step by step from its nuclear commitments besides the recent move to begin enrichment activities in fordow nuclear facilities iran has since may stated to build stockpiles of nuclear fuel and enrich low grade uranium to a higher level of purity it also started up advanced centrifuges to gradually boost the country s stockpile of enriched uranium and research activities all of which had been restricted by the nuclear deal although iran has refined uranium to a fissile purity of 4 5 percent far below the bomb grade threshold of 90 percent and stressed that its nuclear program is aimed at peaceful purposes iran s decision to reduce nuclear commitments has raised concerns of europe as well on nov 12 europe threatened that they may trigger a mechanism that could re impose international and un sanctions on iran in case the country does not honor its obligations under the deal u s sanctions coupled with levels of corruption and the iranian government s mismanagement of economy have played a key role in the problems that has hit iran s economy almost major sectors of the economy have experienced the burden of a recession according to the imf s world economic outlook report in october the impact of sanctions will contract iran s economy 9 5 percent in the current year a similar report was made by the world bank which set the contraction of the iranian economy at 8 7 percent in 2019 negative projections for iran s economy along with the recent rise in energy indicators unleashed a wave of violent protests and criticism of president hassan rouhani inside the country on nov 15 the iranian government started rationing subsidized gasoline and increased its prices according to a statement published by national iranian oil products distribution company the price for a liter of subsidized gasoline was increased to 15 000 rials or nearly 35 cents at the official rate of 42 000 rials per dollar from the earlier 10 000 rials the statement said that the monthly ration for each passenger car is set at 60 liters additional purchases would cost 30 000 rials per liter following the hike of the prices protests and violence erupted in a number of iranian cities at least 100 banks and dozens of governmental buildings were set ablaze during the recent protests over gas price hike local reports said more than 1 000 rioters have been detained we have passed through the crisis rouhani said promising that the economy will grow slightly in the year to come despite the imf and the world bank reports on iran s economy and rouhani s critics laylaz believes that some degrees of stability in the country s economy gave the government the confidence that it could survive the economic and social impact of reducing fuel subsidies laylaz argued that rouhani did not increase the oil price immediately after u s sanctions last year as the impact of pressures could have triggered even worse protests the stability of the economy over the past year helped the government finally dare to increase oil prices he added

modern monetary theory aka mmt is the latest incarnation of a long running current in economic thought once called chartalism which has gained prominence in recent years as an alternative to austerity economics whose dictates have immiserated millions destabilized world politics and threaten the extinction of the human race thanks to climate inaction in the guise of fiscal restraint mmt s core precept is that governments first spend money into existence and then tax it out of existence contrast this with the standard account that says that governments must tax citizens to pay for programs which raises the question how did the citizens get the money to pay for their taxes unless the government first spent that money into existence given that governments are the sole source of currency the implications for this are relatively easy to follow but are profound in terms of where they lead you mmters hold that sovereign currency issuers most countries but not eurozone countries like greece say cannot default on their debts so long as those debts are denominated in the currency they issue unlike venezuela say which owed debts denominated in us dollars and while government spending can lead to inflation it s not deficits that cause inflation it s government spending on things that the private sector is also seeking to buy if the government is procuring materials labor or goods that the private sector is already using it creates a bidding war that drives up the prices of these things but if there is stuff that the private sector is not using notably if there are unemployed people who want work that the private sector isn t delivering then the state can spend as much as it needs to mobilize that labor in service to public goals like remediating climate change and even when governments do spend money into existence to buy things the private sector is using it needn t be inflationary the most prominent example of massive non inflationary public spending is wwii when governments procured a huge amount of things the private sector was using including labor and materials but despite all that spending states were able to control inflation by selling war bonds which sequestered away the new capital so it wasn t available to chase the things the state needed to tool up for war on his macrotourist blog kevin muir has written an excellent plain language two part primer on mmt and its implications it s an important guide to a difficult subject that has profound implications for us all during a lecture a couple of years ago mmt professor randall wray recalled how the american central bank did everything contrary to the bagehot dictum in his famous book lombard street bagehot argued that the central bank should lend freely at a high rate of interest and on good securities well the federal reserve broke all three tenets they did not lend freely but instead put quantitative limits on the amounts of loans instead of punishing the banks that needed to borrow they subsidized them with discounted rates finally the fed took all their shitty credits they did everything they could to help the financial economy while ignoring or even worse punishing the real economy the reason i bring this up mmt has a completely different solution than traditional economic theory mmt ers don t believe in force feeding more monetary stimulus in the hope that somewhere it will ignite and cause an economic rebound although at the time i didn t understand that my views were consistent with mmt during the financial crisis i felt like the government s response was ridiculous the problem was a lack of demand not overly expensive money i argued that if the bond market was begging for an investable riskless asset why doesn t the government give it to them at the time the 30 year us treasury was ticking just above 2 instead of doing more qe why didn t the government float a gazillion of 50 or 100 year paper back then i thought the government had to borrow first and install internet fiber to everyone s home or fix all the bridges and airports you know something productive i figured that even the government could invest the capital at a rate which would yield a return greater than the 3 interest rate i reckoned the bonds would trade at practitioner s guide to mmt part 1 practitioner s guide to mmt part 2 via naked capitalism

moscow a russian backed bank payment card introduced after western sanctions upended russia s financial system five years ago and prompted visa and mastercard to deny electronic services to some of the country s leading banks is set for its european debut on london wednesday when a pilot project will be launched in collaboration with the dutch global payment company payxpert moscow authorities hoped to get the mir card accepted eventually in foreign markets but progress has been slow outside russia for the mir payment system which operates outside of western controlled international financial systems such as swift which banks use to transfer money the pilot project with payxpert will lay the foundation for new promising trends in the foreign expansion of russian payment cards according to vladimir komlev the head of russia s national card payment system which operates the mir system de dollarization efforts the effort is seen by analysts as part of the kremlin bid to de dollarize the russian economy to lessen the sting of western sanctions a russian finance ministry official this month told reuters that russia will next year diversify its foreign currency holdings in its national wealth fund which supports russia s public pension system aiming to lower the share of dollars in the fund s reserves dmitry dolgin of the dutch banking group ing said in a report this month that de dollarization efforts are now obvious across most sectors including local business loans and bank held international assets although he said the dollar s role has actually increased in company and household savings and cash assets partly because dollar interest rates have been higher than those offered for euros u s authorities have been able advance sanctions by targeting companies that use dollars and the establishment of electronic payment systems not tied to the dollar or largely controlled by u s businesses is one way for the kremlin to reduce the impact of the west s serial punishment of moscow washington and the european union have imposed a wave of sanctions since 2014 to punish russia for the 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula alleged meddling in the 2016 u s elections and the poisoning of a defected russian spy in england komlev told reuters this year that in the next three years we want mir cards to be operational in countries where russians are used to traveling he projected mir cards would be operational at some banks in at least a dozen countries by the end of this year turkish banks started to conduct transactions this year with mir which means both peace and world in russian mir was launched initially as a national payment system with the first cards issued in december 2015 russia s leading bank state owned sberbank started issuing them in october 2016 and by the end of last year more than 70 million mir based cards had been issued by 64 russian banks the kremlin has mandated that state welfare and pension payments must be processed through the system by next year along with salaries paid to civil servants the card has a long way to go before it rivals visa our mastercard internationally it is not accepted by international shopping platforms or major online booking services for airlines and hotels although apexx fintech a british start up global payment company said thursday it would now start working with the mir system among smartphone applications only samsung has concluded an agreement with the mir system meanwhile de dollarization has been moving quickly russia s central bank has currency swap

stock market crashes the dow jones has rallied more than 25 in the year to date easily recouping losses from last winter current conditions are eerily similar to that of the circumstances ahead of prior stock market crashes regardless of your view on the market it is important to be aware of the trading risk with current valuations stock market crashes current climate compared to prior conditions the dow jones has enjoyed a remarkable rally in the twilight of 2019 which has put it on pace to recoup losses from the year prior despite trade wars slowing global growth and recession concerns evidently the combined effort of the major central banks has paid off with various stock markets approaching or extending beyond record levels as the market enters a historically bullish time of year thanks to the santa claus rally and january effect many market participants have called for a continuation higher a brief history of major financial bubbles crises and flash crashes but others are hesitant to accept current valuations fearing the market has become complacent and the risks highlighted earlier in the year may still spark a crash with that in mind we can compare the current landscape to the conditions present immediately prior to three of the largest stock market crashes in the last 30 years united states invasion of kuwait and the 1990 stock market crash the stock market crash in 1990 followed the us invasion of kuwait which saw oil prices surge in the lead up economic measures were unremarkable but not to the degree that the subsequent market reaction would suggest upon the invasion in july 1990 the dow jones went on to plummet 18 before october of that same year as oil surged from 16 a barrel to over 40 a barrel source bloomberg asset performances at the time were largely within reason which gave market pundits little reason to suspect a looming disaster the us dollar and gold were lower for the year and stocks were establishing new all time highs crude oil was beginning to show signs of volatility but far from the level of volatility that would follow similarly simple technical analysis of the dow jones at the time reveals little cause for concern trading comfortably above its 50 and 200 day moving averages the dow jones delivered a bullish breakout above 2 800 in mid may 1990 only to fall beneath 2 400 just 5 months later from a technical standpoint one could argue the dow s drive above resistance at 2 800 mirrors the industrial average s recent breakout above 27 600 dow jones price chart daily timeframe january 1989 july 1990 chart 1 dot com crash in the mid 1990 s to 2000 equity markets would be engrossed with technology stocks only for them to come crashing down in early 2000 the result saw the dow jones trade gradually lower for more than two years until it eventually bottomed in october 2002 in the months prior data revealed manufacturing was roaring and job additions were incredibly robust source bloomberg looking to the technical backdrop at the time the dow jones appeared to be on the brink of a breakout higher trading confidently higher since september 1998 the industrial average enjoyed a bounty of support beneath and was able to pierce an overhead trendline just days before the market plummeted technical traders at the time would have warned of the potential for a false breakout or the beginning of a new leg higher depending which side their biases guided them to dow jones price chart daily timeframe july 1998 january 2000 chart 2 great financial crisis like the dot com crash years before the housing market crisis saw the dow jones derail in spectacular fashion as companies declared bankruptcy and the government turned to taxpayers in an effort to keep large commercial banks afloat nevertheless the burst bubble would wrack the financial world as few were able to predict its arrival to be sure some market pundits were becoming hesitant the gains could go on well in advance of the eventual turbulence in an npr piece posted on july 20 2007 the author highlights weak earnings from caterpillar a global growth bellwether as the reason for the dow jones slipping beneath 14 000 a level it surpassed for the first time ever just days before source npr but opinions were divided as always and some analysts were convinced the market was experiencing a bout of volatility like any other even after the cracks had begun to show in a cnn money article published on august 9 2007 analysts offered their view on the market following recent selloffs we re in a volatile place kiddoo said and there s an overreaction to the news and rumors here that s feeding into that volatility concerns about credit and the housing market aren t likely to disappear anytime soon goldman said yet going forward the equity market is probably in a better place to absorb the unrest than it was a month ago since many of the stock indexes are well off their 2007 highs additionally the financial underpinnings of the market remain positive in the long term kiddoo said the next month or so is bound to be choppy the analysts said as is typical in august but stocks could stabilize and recharge for the classic fourth quarter advance dow jones price chart daily timeframe july 2006 october 2007 chart 3 with the benefit of hindsight we know the dow jones would proceed to top in october 2007 before tumbling throughout the fourth quarter and the following year despite worsening credit conditions in the months immediately prior to the crash some analysts remained confident not willing to lose out on potential gains further still the technical foundation was extended at record highs but relatively reasonable considering some of the technical pictures the index has painted since although concern was warranted traders pressed on and a similar sentiment can be seen in the current market the stock market in 2019 and 2020 the year to date has been full of concerns ranging from brexit slowing global growth and the ongoing trade war with china in turn central banks have worked to combat the headwinds by loosening monetary policy effectively admitting their domestic economies need a helping hand nevertheless stock markets across the developed world have pressed to lofty levels and equities in the united states have established new highs comfortably source business insider while many are warning of inflated asset prices ballooning debt and an uncertain future others have doubled down arguing the advent of monetary easing has opened the door to an entirely new stock market rally that will reach well beyond current levels source cnbc whichever camp you fall into economic measures reveal a slowing us economy whether or not the floor for economic growth has been hit is yet to be seen but with data from the year to date it is hard to refute the economy is in a weaker position now than it was a year ago when the market was in the middle of a precipitous decline nevertheless it is hard for a profit seeking investor to argue against stocks while they trade at record highs source bloomberg with that in mind it is easy to spot similarities between current conditions and past instances of market instability but as is often the case time in the market beats timing the market consequently many traders have discarded warning signals and economic headwinds in favor of latching onto stock s incredible rally and extracting every available pip while it can be hard to sit idly by as stocks ascend traders should be cognizant of the incredibly lofty valuations at which the dow jones trades and hedge accordingly dow jones price chart daily timeframe february 2018 november 2019 chart 4 given the current climate short term targets with clear entry and exit points could prove to be a prudent investment strategy for those looking to capture the equity rally despite the uncertainty further still equity portfolios should also possess exposure to assets with negative correlations like gold or the us dollar for example therefore in the event of a sudden shock like the dot com bubble or great financial crisis the damage dealt could be lessened while the market barrels toward its next major move whether higher or lower check back at dailyfx com for updates and analysis and follow peterhanksfx on twitter for similar content

a russian backed bank payment card introduced after western sanctions upended russia s financial system five years ago and prompted visa and mastercard to deny electronic services to some of the country s leading banks is set for its european debut on london wednesday when a pilot project will be launched in collaboration with the dutch global payment company payxpert moscow authorities hoped to get the mir card accepted eventually in foreign markets but progress has been slow outside russia for the mir payment system which operates outside of western controlled international financial systems such as swift which banks use to transfer money the pilot project with payxpert will lay the foundation for new promising trends in the foreign expansion of russian payment cards according to vladimir komlev the head of russia s national card payment system which operates the mir system de dollarization efforts the effort is seen by analysts as part of the kremlin bid to de dollarize the russian economy to lessen the sting of western sanctions a russian finance ministry official this month told reuters that russia will next year diversify its foreign currency holdings in its national wealth fund which supports russia s public pension system aiming to lower the share of dollars in the fund s reserves dmitry dolgin of the dutch banking group ing said in a report this month that de dollarization efforts are now obvious across most sectors including local business loans and bank held international assets although he said the dollar s role has actually increased in company and household savings and cash assets partly because dollar interest rates have been higher than those offered for euros u s authorities have been able advance sanctions by targeting companies that use dollars and the establishment of electronic payment systems not tied to the dollar or largely controlled by u s businesses is one way for the kremlin to reduce the impact of the west s serial punishment of moscow washington and the european union have imposed a wave of sanctions since 2014 to punish russia for the 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula alleged meddling in the 2016 u s elections and the poisoning of a defected russian spy in england komlev told reuters this year that in the next three years we want mir cards to be operational in countries where russians are used to traveling he projected mir cards would be operational at some banks in at least a dozen countries by the end of this year turkish banks started to conduct transactions this year with mir which means both peace and world in russian mir was launched initially as a national payment system with the first cards issued in december 2015 russia s leading bank state owned sberbank started issuing them in october 2016 and by the end of last year more than 70 million mir based cards had been issued by 64 russian banks the kremlin has mandated that state welfare and pension payments must be processed through the system by next year along with salaries paid to civil servants the card has a long way to go before it rivals visa our mastercard internationally it is not accepted by international shopping platforms or major online booking services for airlines and hotels although apexx fintech a british start up global payment company said thursday it would now start working with the mir system among smartphone applications only samsung has concluded an agreement with the mir system meanwhile de dollarization has been moving quickly russia s central bank has currency swap deals in place with iran china and turkey allowing direct trade to be conducted in local currencies instead of u s dollars russia reportedly lost 7 7 billion in its bid to reduce dollars held in its reserves some of the dollars were turned into gold and since january the bank has purchased 96 4 metric tons of gold alexei zabotkin head of the russian central bank s monetary policy department has conceded that it would be impossible to completely empty the country s foreign exchange reserves of dollars as this would be fraught with excessive risks according to central bank data the national wealth fund has 45 5 billion 39 17 billion euros and 7 67 billion british pounds in august the state controlled rosneft oil giant announced it would stop using the u s dollar for its export contracts nonetheless analysts say there are limits on how far russia can de dollarize the ruble is highly volatile and remains unattractive for investors and de dollarization brings additional and sometimes prohibitive trading costs european regulators will be watching the london project closely eu officials have been sympathetic about russia s de dollarization bid suspecting that as a spinoff the euro will be boosted as an international currency in june the european commission concluded that the euro clearly stands out as the only candidate that has all the necessary attributes of a global currency that market participants could use as an alternative to the u s dollar

above as well as the decrease in yield per ton kilometer and the negative impact of exchange rates operating expenses decreased by approximately usd 21 2 million in the reported period reflecting a decline of about 1 5 compared to the first nine months of 2018 the change is attributable to the following reasons a decrease of approximately usd 34 2 million in jet fuel expenses a decrease as a result of the implementation of ifrs 16 that moved approximately usd 20 million to financing expenses the majority remained in expenses for depreciation of rights to use leased assets that are included in operating expenses see note 2 c 4 to the condensed financial statements an increase in depreciation expenses with respect to owned assets and a reduction in the rights to use leased assets in accordance with ifrs 16 as a result of a growth in the company s flight equipment with the continued receipt of the 787 9 dreamliners an increase of approximately usd 22 million in payroll expenses compared to the first nine months of 2018 mainly due to new wage agreements and transition of pilots between fleets and as a result of an increase in the actuarial liability as explained above a decrease in other operating expenses mainly due to the streamlining of some of the company s expense items such as air passage fees and maintenance costs which were positively affected by the shift to the 787 9 aircraft and as a result of the improvement in the company s work relations the company s jet fuel expenses decreased by approximately usd 34 2 million in the reported period indicating a decrease of about 8 5 compared to the company s expenses in the first nine months of 2018 mainly as a result of the decrease in the amount of fuel consumed by the company s aircraft notwithstanding the 4 1 increase in its available seat per kilometer ask primarily due to the continued entry of the 787 9 aircraft which are more efficient in fuel consumption in addition fuel expenses were positively affected by the drop in jet fuel market prices on the other hand hedging transactions had a smaller positive impact in the reported period as set forth below the table below reflects the

net financing expenses amounted to approximately usd 60 3 million in the reported period compared to the first nine months of 2018 this increase is mainly attributable to the implementation of ifrs 16 that resulted in recording interest expenses on liabilities for leased assets in the amount of usd 31 5 million and an additional expense of approximately usd 2 4 million for exchange rate differences due to a balance sheet exposure to lease liabilities that were denominated in non dollar currencies mainly shekel in addition during the period there was an increase in loan interest expenses mostly due to the increase in the amount of loans taken by the company to finance the 787 9 aircraft that the company acquired loss before tax amounted to approximately usd 35 million compared to a profit

deposits and a reduction in the receivables item mainly receivables due to renovation of leased engines current liabilities amounted to usd 1 084 million indicating an increase of approximately usd 69 million compared to their balance as of december 31 2018 a major part of the increase is attributable to the implementation of ifrs 16 for which current maturities of lease liabilities totaling

and current maturities a decrease in payables and a decrease in the balance of derivative financial instruments working capital the company has a working capital deficit of approximately usd 654 million compared to a deficit of approximately usd 598 million as of december 31 2018 the increase in the working capital compared to december 31 2018 is mainly attributable to the initial

s current ratio dropped to 39 7 compared to current ratio of 41 1 as of december 31 2018 as of september 30 2019 the working capital deficit consisted of substantial components that were included in the current liabilities item and are characterized by current business cycle however the company is not required to use cash flow sources in the short term in order to repay these components such as prepaid revenues from sale of airline tickets and the matmid frequent flyer club in a total amount of approximately usd 340 million that will be discharged by providing future flight services and

market experts made big predictions for 2019 but did they get them right it s that time of year when banks brokers and analysts issue predictions for what the following 12 months will bring for financial markets the experts gain bragging rights if their forecasts play out perfectly but predictions can also go spectacularly wrong in the world of finance cnbc looks back at what some analysts said in late 2018 to see what was forecast for 2019 and whether so far they have been right oil since january 1 2019 brent crude has risen and fallen to end up around 18 higher at just under 64 per barrel by early november j p morgan said there would be a moderate recovery in prices during the first half of 2019 thanks to opec and non opec supply restrictions in an accurate summary of oil s 2019 performance so far the bank said prices were then expected to trend lower as global growth cools predictions for the average 2019 oil price for brent included 70 per barrel from goldman sachs and bofa merrill lynch 60 from citi and 61 from the u s energy information administration eia as at november 22 2019 s brent crude average price stood at 63 59 sitting roughly around the middle of most predictions and a touch lower than the latest call from the eia 10 year treasurys at the end of 2018 goldman sachs was still holding on to a prediction that the federal reserve was set to raise rates four times across the year pimco the world s biggest trader of bonds predicted three additional policy rate hikes from the fed by the end of 2019 in a november 2018 blog pimco claimed that rising interest rates were a fixture of late cycle market and were set to grind higher in 2019 particularly in the u s in the end the fed actually lowered rates three times and the yield on the 10 year treasury note has fallen steadily over 2019 dipping to about 1 45 in early september as fears peaked that the world economy was headed into recession territory the price of treasurys which moves inversely to yields rose as investors hunted for a safe place to park cash in late august the yield on a 10 year treasury was lower than the two year a phenomenon known as yield curve inversion which many economists treat as a sign of impending recession in november 2018 the charles schwab brokerage accurately predicted that 2019 was likely to mark a peak in u s treasury yields in the current cycle at the time the brokerage said in our view u s bond yields already appear high relative to current global economic conditions it added that improved employment data in the u s wasn t likely to translate to higher inflation again a correct call gold gold prices rolled along for the first half of the year offering little evidence of what was coming then at the beginning of july the drums of the trade war got louder while global economic data soured so far this year the precious metal has enjoyed a 14 rise and as of november 26 the spot gold price sits at 1 455 per troy ounce gold is traditionally seen as a safe place to invest during periods of uncertainty citi analysts apparently underestimated gold s reputation as a haven against volatility predicting gold to average 1 270 per ounce in 2019 j p morgan said it expected gold to average 1 325 per troy ounce this year while bank of america predicted a rise to an average of 1 296 per ounce but noted a rally could see the price go as high as 1 400 predictions by many were based on one assumption that interest rates might push higher across 2019 or at least remain at the same level instead the fed has been forced to cut rates three times gold pays out no yield making it less attractive when interest rates are higher european stocks the end of 2018 was a gloomy time for european stocks with the year being chalked down as the worst in a decade the u k s ftse 100 index lost more than 12 over the 12 month period and the pan european stoxx 600 ended down 13 its worst year since the financial crisis of 2008 as analysts looked to 2019 there was little optimism that europe s political crises would offer any respite j p morgan noted that political tail risks remain a headwind for european stocks highlighting uncertainty over brexit and italian debt the ecb has started acquiring 20bn of bonds a month from november in a bid to stimulate economic activity french bank societe generale predicted the top 50 stocks of europe listed in the euro stoxx 50 would tumble another 8 and the ftse would lose as much as 14 in value schroders was less gloomy on europe arguing that during 2018 the equity market has already factored in the slowdown and noting that at the beginning of 2019 investors had an opportunity to get in at a five year low based on in house calculations with around five weeks of trade to go the index is at 404 points a year to date rise of around 20 source cnbc

written by yeh ji ren translated by brian hioe china announced the establishment of six new free trade zones ftzs on october 26 20 days after the announcement of a new area of the shanghai free trade zone with the new ftzs in china one also notes similar free economic pilot zones fepzs have also been established in taiwan but it has been a long debated topic with political elements especially during the election season would free economic pilot zones allow for chinese goods to be passed off as taiwanese goods due to the u s china trade war there are some concerns that the loosened restrictions of fepzs could allow for chinese goods to be passed off as made in taiwan the u s government fears that chinese commodities exported to the u s will first be shipped to taiwan as a way of avoiding the high export tariffs currently imposed on china can chinese goods be passed off as made in taiwan goods through taiwan s fepzs can the fepzs be an accomplice in hiding the origin of those chinese products and as a result harm local farmers or manufacturers in taiwan photo credit ap tpg images former president ma ying jeou shakes hands with tsai ing wen during a televised debate on a free trade agreement with china on april 25 2010 according to the amendment of article 3 of the regulations governing issuance of certificates of origin and certificates of processing on april 3 2018 if exported goods are to be labelled made in taiwan they must meet one of the following conditions they are wholly obtained or wholly produced in taiwan if the processing manufacturing or materials of the products involve undertakings in taiwan and other countries or regions the last substantial transformation shall be undergone in taiwan according to the first condition products must be completely produced in the country whether they are mineral agricultural or fish products in order to receive the label made in taiwan with few exceptions to qualify as substantially transformed under the condition requires more than 35 percent of processing and producing done in taiwan or to be sufficiently transformed to change the original product category in order to qualify as a made in taiwan product for exports given these conditions it s difficult for foreign products like farm produce and fish to wash away their origins in taiwan as such it s hard to say that chinese agricultural products transiting through the fepzs would hurt taiwanese industry it s also not easy for chinese products to be labeled as made in taiwan after only briefly transiting in taiwan before heading to the united states free trade zones and free economic pilot zones are both experimental what we should note is that both the chinese ftzs or the taiwanese fepzs are for pilot experiments they re specifically used to test small scale policies before rolling out out to other regions why to put it simply government can be cautious regarding liberalization the loosening of restrictions and innovative concepts while also recognizing their benefits hence governments would hope to test out policies in smaller areas allowing for detailed observation of potential problems through tightly controlled variables if these policies are later enlarged in scope but have unexpected results the government won t be dealing with a complete unknown that s the true value of a ftz or a fepz therefore it may not be appropriate to examine the success of a pilot zone in terms of its direct contribution to the economy photo credit shutterstock shanghai china is china continuing to add free trade zones because they re beneficial to the economy china s vice minister of commerce wang shou wen 王受文 stated that the latest ftzs are to implement the foreign investment act which ensures stable foreign investment and create a transparent predictable investment environment since establishing the shanghai pilot zone in 2013 china has announced 19 more free trade zones throughout the country the aim in establishing the first wave of free trade zones in 2013 was to encourage development through streamlining currency convertability the second wave of ftzs established in 2015 were tianjin fujian guangdong with the aim to make investment more convenient and provide for more effective regulation and supervision recently ftzs in shandong jiangsu guangxi hebei yunnan and heilongjiang all have different development goals but the primary one is to push forward the one belt one road initiative from the perspective of development goals alone it may be acceptable to introduce a ftz in response to emerging central and local development needs but whether this is effective remains questionable the wall street journal pointed out that very few american companies had any breakthroughs in the shanghai ftz though some administrative processes might be simplified in the zone trade liberalization and international reform continue to be unsteady reuters reported that with the slowing of economic growth the authorities in beijing have instituted strict capital controls and oversight for many companies the promise of free circulation of currency within china remains unfulfilled in the shanghai ftz the only clear rule is to not threaten financial and internet security while everything else is muddy if companies have to prioritize the national government s definition of security in a small ftz it s not hard to imagine the ineffectiveness of such pilot zone while the shanghai ftz is a symbolic area to promote international commerce many corporations have already found it difficult to expand their operations then what would the other 19 ftzs look like and how would they really contribute to the development of entrepreneurship and innovation in china why does taiwan also want to set up free trade pilot zones setting up pilot zones and special economic zones in china has not accomplished its goals of encouraging development it has not yielded the expected results in terms of liberalization and internationalization either given the failures foreign capital will not place too much faith in china s ftzs moving forward this should serve as a warning for taiwan before setting up fepzs since 2013 taiwan has already established numerous fepzs including six seaports taoyuan international airport and pingtung s agricultural biotechnology park compared to china taiwan is a small island but it offers high economic freedom and an established democratic rule of law taiwan s level of economic development is also more advanced than that of china having already entered the stage of an innovation led economy comparatively speaking china is still at the stage of an efficiency driven economy with the aim of lowering production costs and pushing for tax concessions taiwan already went through this stage a long time ago and it does not have the same amount of concerns as china does when it comes to further liberalization or internationalization if there is a need to loosen restrictions in order to push an innovative practice across the country this is more easily done in taiwan so does it make sense for us to set up free trade zones according to the same logic as china photo credit shutterstock taipei taiwan in terms of countries or territories with limited geographic space such as hong kong and macau or small european countries such as holland belgium and luxembourg we can t find that many examples of free trade zones we would more often encounter examples like singapore which only has one airport logistics park and several wharfs that serve as a free trade zone the successes of singapore s push for economic liberalization to achieve internationalization are visible in that singapore was placed first out of 63 countries in the 2019 world competitiveness yearbook as a small country with a small population is it appropriate to set up many free trade zones in taiwan taiwan as a data driven economy by the 21st century taiwan had already entered the stage of economic development of an innovation driven economy if we did need a pilot area it would probably be for the sake of experimenting with an innovation and data driven economy in the 1980s with improvements in labor conditions the manufacturing sector gradually lost its competitiveness due to rising costs policy considerations then leaned toward promoting techniques for enhancing manufacturing productivity to try and counteract the loss of competitiveness but this could not prevent the wave of taiwanese factories relocating their operations elsewhere the failure to complete industrial upgrade was a significant factor contributing to taiwan s inability to keep its industries localized although that was 30 years ago the advancement of taiwan s manufacturing technologies still remains a top policy priority outside of a few large scale science and technology manufacturers this is primarily targeting small to medium sized manufacturers and their supporting industries the european union has placed a great deal of focus on the emerging data economy with the aim of setting up what is termed as a digital single market through the horizon 2020 plan the eu has provided a great deal of resources for researching and developing plans for infrastructure it has brought the brightest minds together to tackle the eu s challenges of digitization promote high tech innovation and confront difficult issues regarding economic innovation and society in this way the eu hopes to become a world leader in in different fields under the premise of an emerging data economy if a fepz is necessary then taiwan should set up policy aims to prepare for the era of data economy to also build up taiwan as one of the first countries to successfully undergo digital transformation this can serve as a means of combating china s red supply chain through developing deeper links with the world s largest free trade area fta the eu japan economic partnership agreement taiwan can also make up for its lack of presences in other ftas to establish a forward looking special economic zone should first aim to build up taiwan as a leader in the data driven economy read

forecasts 2 5 growth for nigeria in 2020 nume ekeghe the international monetary fund imf has said nigeria s debt to gross domestic product gdp ratio which currently stands at 28 per cent is still below the average in africa despite the fact that the country s debt level has risen it also reiterated that revenue to gdp ratio in the country remains low and urged the federal government to increase its drive to create more jobs and enhance fiscal consolidation imf senior resident representative and mission chief for nigeria mr amine mati said this yesterday in lagos at the public presentation of the fall 2019 a regional economic outlook for sub saharan africa the debt management office had recently revealed that out of nigeria s total debt profile of n25 7 trillion as of june 2019 external borrowing accounted for about 32 per cent while 68 per cent was from domestic borrowing but mati noted that even though nigeria s debt has increased the level was way below the average for the region even if we include the central bank of nigeria s overdraft and others we are talking about a debt to gdp ratio that doesn t go beyond 27 or 28 per cent to gdp and that is including amcon overdraft etc he explained commenting on the need for fiscal consolidation he said for resource intensive countries and the non resource intensive countries one thing that is common is that when there is trade shock they react so you lose revenue and debts go up in most countries you would see debt is about 50 per cent to gdp and has increased since 2016 in all cases but what is new is that most of the countries are back on a sustainable path and most countries have plans to reduce debt through fiscal consolidation and have seemed to have stabilised the three largest countries that are driving sub saharan growth are angola south africa and nigeria angola has a negative growth south africa has a growth below one per cent and nigeria growing between 2 and 2 5 per cent which is still on the negative per capita growth nigeria in the first three quarters the numbers that came out was at 2 2 per cent and our forecast of 2 3 per cent for the year is still on track depending on how agriculture ict perform but the average for the region is 3 2 per cent so 3 2 per cent was in 2019 which is the same growth rate as 2018 therefore in 2020 for the region we project 3 6 per cent nigeria is still on 2 3 per cent for 2019 but for 2020 we project a growth of 2 5 per cent so it is still not growing as fast as others for a variety of reasons including some of the structural reforms and others but it is picking up on what could affect nigeria s outlook he said it would be mostly affected by external factors we had a tightening of global markets at some point which also reduced some flows and investments but one i need to point out is the risk to global trade tensions with trade tension between america and china export growth of the region has gone down and the volume of trade for the region as a whole and globally has gone down almost to zero so whatever happens externally will also impact africa the demand is down but for countries like nigeria that depend on natural resources lower demand for oil would impact on the price also he added in addition he stressed the need for african countries to prioritise job creation saying 20 million people would be joining the job market in sub saharan africa and these are new jobs that need to be created through structural reforms and whatever reforms are being pursued so far we have been able to create only 10 million jobs so we need to do more because 10 million new jobs need to be created going forward he stated on his part the managing director financial derivatives company and a member of the president buhari s economic advisory council mr bismarck rewane who also spoke at the forum said we don t have a debt crisis we have a revenue problem but there are also other problems such as poverty productivity so it is not if we have a debt or revenue problem also what we use our revenue for is also important so the government expenditure and the government investment multiplier are much lower than the private sector multiplier and the difference between the flow of wealth and the stock of wealth is a different story the important thing is to be aware and doing nothing would have a major consequence and i think we are in that stage of awareness and there is a sense of urgency and then there is action taking there is a beaker of hope at the end of the tunnel

heinberg s new coal question the most serious carbon issue today as scientists like nasa s james hansen emphasize is not oil but coal to avert a disastrous climate change tipping point hansen argues peak oil must be accompanied by peak coal and in fact coal fired plants must be rapidly phased out to protect the earth 1 yet coal exploitation is commonly presented by the vested interests as a solution to energy scarcity indeed some such as james fallows in the latest issue of atlantic magazine even promote the erroneous idea that clean coal an oxymoron will save the earth from climate change 2 heinberg wades deeply into these issues in his book focusing on estimates of coal reserves and of peak coal production he concludes that there is far less energy to be had from world coal reserves than is typically thought by policy makers yet as hansen has stressed and heinberg acknowledges at one point the greatest immediate threat from coal is not its scarcity but its consumption which threatens to push the climate past dangerous tipping points though the ecological considerations of coal are unfortunately something of a secondary consideration in heinberg s book he is perhaps too directly concerned with the issue of peak coal rather than how this fits into climate change there is nonetheless much that is important in blackout for those who see climate change and ecological crises more generally as our most pressing planetary problems heinberg rightly rejects the notion that fossil fuel scarcity on its own will solve climate concerns as a dangerously premature conclusion 119 rather the peaking of oil production is likely to drive more production of increasingly carbon intensive and toxic fuels in general human society faces a conundrum unless non fossil sources of energy are developed quickly or unless society finds a way to operate with much less energy the depletion of higher quality fuels natural gas and oil will mean that efforts to obtain more energy will entail burning ever dirtier fuels in proportionally larger quantities in order to derive equivalent amounts of energy the answer to the question will coal oil and gas depletion solve climate change is therefore an unequivocal no 122 ultimately heinberg recognizes that the issue is a political one the longer we pursue energy from coal instead of committing to renewable energy and reduced energy consumption he emphasizes the worse will be the economic and ecological costs and the less likely such a transition will be successful for heinberg blackout refers to the possibility that our current squandering of energy resources even setting aside the effects of climate change presents the possibility of catastrophic and effectively permanent ecological economic collapse perhaps the worst weakness of his book is to confuse the nature of this collapse is it peak energy or climate change that is the real issue the main strength of heinberg s book however is its succinct packaging of complex technical and economic reports and their implications for the economic and logistical challenges posed by dwindling coal reserves although i would have liked to have seen more systematic attention to ecological problems caused by coal production as well as consumption his overall analysis is to be commended for placing front and center the impossibility of maintaining the increasing energy demands characteristic of capitalism william stanley jevons s famous coal question raised the paradox that greater efficiency in coal use was in turn overtaken by the expansion of coal consumption this paradox became an essential premise in asking what britain should do about the pending scarcity of its primary energy source 3 for a time new fossil fuels and a global economy made the scarcity issue though not the paradox moot yet in heinberg s book it may be seen that the world now faces a new coal question how to leave coal in the ground when our economic system insatiably demands energy in order to meet its demands for perpetual growth as hansen and others have proposed the projected peaking of oil and gas production presents the opportunity to stay below the critical tipping point of 350 ppm carbon dioxide if we can stop the increasing release of this greenhouse gas from coal and other unconventional fossil fuels such as tar sands however heinberg and other environmentalists must come to realize that an answer to this question necessarily cuts to the heart of capitalist accumulation class domination and global imperialism peak oil and peak coal heinberg proposes that in understanding potential scarcity in both coal and oil supplies the real concern is when production will peak as with oil prediction of when coal production will peak is difficult to determine with any precision coal production estimates are closely determined by the extent and fashion in which coal will be used in the future as a substitute for oil and gas coal varies greatly in quality anthracite and bituminous coal are the most energy dense coals followed by sub bituminous and then lignite heinberg stresses that some studies find that bituminous production in the united states has already peaked and that the peak for all grades of coal will come between 2030 and 2035 as the higher quality coal reserves are exhausted both ecological as well as economic costs increase because greater volumes must be extracted processed transported and burned to meet demand for the same amount of energy reflecting the fact that lower quality forms of coal will be brought into production in terms of ecological economics this entails a decrease in energy return on energy invested because there is less energy per ton as quality declines energy from coal will peak more rapidly than tonnage and potential greenhouse gas emissions increase more rapidly per unit of energy this is not a problem confined to the united states which has some of the world s largest reserves after reviewing recent estimates of global coal reserves and production trends heinberg concludes that many if not most nations coal reserves are currently overestimated this is partly due to the misleading common method of describing fossil fuel reserves in terms of reserves over current production rates as in the u s energy department s assertion that the united states has a two hundred year supply of coal heinberg says that such estimates are always wrong because of three basic factors first rates of consumption vary over time with the tendency being to increase second as the most accessible and high quality reserves tend to be exhausted first maintaining current levels or increasing production becomes more and more difficult third what counts as a reserve changes with new discoveries and variations in the cost effectiveness of available extraction methods while the third factor may increase reserves when new deposits are found or better methods of extraction are developed the first two factors contribute to production peaking faster than the rate implied by the reserve over current production description in actuality new discoveries have not increased projected reserves heinberg emphasizes that most new studies of known coal reserves since 1986 excluding india and australia have downgraded the amount of coal believed to be minable higher oil and natural gas prices are often projected to increase demand for coal and make profitable the mining of reserves currently considered uneconomical heinberg warns that though higher energy prices will likely boost the price of coal the cost of producing coal is related to the price of oil consider the case of massey energy company the nation s fourth largest coal company which annually produces 40 million tons of coal using about 40 million gallons of diesel fuel if the price of diesel goes up one dollar this translates directly into 40 million in increased costs indirectly related costs also climb 40 as other fossil fuels become more expensive building new coal plants and transport systems and running those transport systems will become increasingly expensive thereby making energy from coal more expensive as well transportation costs in particular are one of the main obstacles to scaling up coal production and consumption 4 this is already a problem for deposits in the western united states northeastern china and northern india the coal industry hopes that new technologies will secure the future of its investments processing coal into liquid fuel is often proposed as a solution to higher prices for other transportation fuels heinberg claims from an energy standpoint the process only makes sense if liquid fuels are at a premium for qualities other than their energy content because coal turned into electricity at high efficiency will power electric vehicles three times as far as liquid fuel made from an equivalent amount of coal will push a combustion vehicle 134 aircraft are one such an example and the u s air force and department of defense are currently investing in coal to liquid plants however each plant will cost as much as an aircraft carrier and use a similar amount of steel because the high cost of such plants relatively few private companies are pursuing them although some governments are with china moving the quickest and on the largest scale however coal to liquids incur additional ecological costs beyond higher carbon emissions china s coal research institute has estimated that 360 gallons of increasingly scarce fresh water will be required to produce each gallon of coal to liquid fuel 59 for electrical power generation the favored prototype is integrated gasification combined cycle igcc facilities these power plants can burn coal more efficiently and can potentially create a number of useful byproducts e g synthetic oil while improving capture of toxic pollutants such as mercury and crucially for climate concerns carbon dioxide the disposal of which presents a separate problem but heinberg cautions that these plants are more expensive possibly much more so and their environmental benefits are uncertain the existing plants in the united states have cleaned up air emissions at the price of greater water pollution state investigations by delaware and minnesota have concluded that proposed plants would not reduce pollution if carbon capture and storage ccs is attempted costs will rise significantly higher coal and climate if as heinberg s review of the literature suggests high quality coal reserves are closer to depletion than commonly assumed then the carbon footprint of increased coal consumption will be nonlinear and grow far more rapidly than coal s relative share of the energy supply the problem of the increased transportation emissions from the higher volumes needed to compensate for lower energy content is further aggravated by the geography of supply as deposits closest to demand centers are exhausted first a greater volume of coal must also be transported greater distances of course the greatest impact of coal s carbon footprint is coal s burning for electrical power generation and it is this stage of the fuel cycle that has received the most attention yet despite the obama administration s and the coal industry s emphasis of ccs as a remedy for coal s climate liabilities heinberg is cautionary for a number of reasons first ccs technologies are unlikely to be developed enough to deploy before 2035 at the earliest second the ccs process inevitably consumes a portion of the energy produced at a plant three general types of css are reviewed each with its own limitations mineral based methods are the only category with no chance of failure resulting in the later release of the gas trapping the carbon in the ocean in addition to having the greatest chance of failure would likely produce serious ecological effects as the increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has already added to the ocean s acidity endangering ocean ecosystems heinberg finds the mineral method of css unlikely due to cost he also finds that simply to capture 60 percent of emissions ocean or geologic storage would require the liquefaction and transport of a volume of carbon dioxide in the united states alone equivalent to total u s oil consumption or about twenty million barrels a day on a global level it has been estimated that liquid carbon dioxide equal to twice the volume of world oil flows would have to be managed simply to capture one fourth of emissions though the engineering challenge and financial cost of such an undertaking at the point of consumption is staggering it is crucial also to consider the increasing spatial and qualitative barriers to scaling up and extending coal production coal is a lower quality fuel in the best case and is being forced to use ever lower quality coal just to offset the declining heating value of us coal while meeting energy information administration forecasts for electricity demand growth by 2030 the nation will then have to mine roughly 80 percent more coal than it is currently mining if and other new technologies for consuming coal are implemented they will increase the amount of coal required in order to produce the same amount of energy for society s use since the energy penalty for capture and sequestration is estimated at 40 percent 52 while setting ecological and social impacts of extraction aside it is possible the united states could double or perhaps even triple coal production to meet this demand qualitative decline and peak production would be moved forward that much faster as distant and lower quality deposits are brought on line the carbon impacts from the energy used in extraction deforestation associated with surface mining and energy use in transportation would also increase accordingly a limitation of the book perhaps understandable given heinberg s primary focus on energy scarcity and secondary focus on climate is that the treatment of non carbon related ecological problems associated with coal use is sparse and anecdotal there are examples the current watershed destruction by mountaintop removal mining in appalachia the potential disruption of siberian indigenous groups by surface mining water consumed by coal processing technologies or the huge amounts of processed coal waste accumulating in south africa but these social and ecological costs unfortunately are not given the kind of systematic treatment that economic costs are in examining the possible futures of coal production heinberg notes that in russia expansion of mining in siberia will entail horrific environmental costs surface mining would result in deforestation or would disrupt environmentally sensitive tundra meanwhile indigenous peoples throughout the sparsely populated region which is already hard hit by the effects of climate change would be displaced or would suffer further degradation of their fragile ecosystems 80 reading this i could only wonder what cumulative effects an increase in the surface mining dominated production that he describes elsewhere would have even expanded underground production can have surprising extraction related ecological costs the wantonness of china s underground coal production creates a shocking greenhouse contribution from the extraction process itself uncontrolled underground coal fires some of which will burn for decades have become an enormous environmental problem in china consuming an estimated 200 million tons of coal annually an amount equal to 10 percent of the nation s coal production china s underground coal fires make an enormous hidden contribution to global warming annually releasing 360 million tons of carbon dioxide as much as all the cars and light trucks in the united states 56 searching for answers to the new coal question unfortunately an underlying weakness in his analysis is revealed when heinberg turns his attention to primarily political economic questions such as will climate concerns succeed in driving policy in the face of energy scarcity 123 heinberg warns that policy makers unlike activists and scientists may look at the evidence through a different lens one that discounts the future in favor of the present hagens argues that discount rates are based in fundamental human psychology and perhaps even hardwired into our genes and nervous systems 123 sadly heinberg uncritically adopts this treatment of the discount rate as a reflection of human nature rather than examining it as a particularly well nurtured and institutionalized feature of capitalist society not being a political economist heinberg should perhaps be forgiven for this after all his conclusion that we must be wary of crises resulting from energy scarcities such as those likely with the peaking of oil production derailing political efforts to cope with climate change is certainly well taken likewise his suggestion of rationing fuels rather than emissions is amply supported and worth consideration however his mistaking of both the underlying social problem capitalism and of the most imminent ecological problem climate change and not peak energy is characteristic of his approach in the conclusion of the book addressing possible futures three scenarios are presented with the effects of climate change in each largely ignored for the sake of simplicity the first two in which energy from coal continues to be relied on for economic growth are distinguished by whether clean coal i e igcc and ccs are pursued both scenarios end in catastrophe and the collapse between 2030 and 2040 of whole civilizations the third post carbon transition scenario is meant to provide a vision for a sustainable society here we see that for heinberg like so many green thinkers it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism lacking a framework with which to analyze the structural connections between economic power and political decisions in heinberg s post carbon future revolutionary changes simply and inexplicably happen heinberg appeals for a shift to the new economic paradigm laid out in herman daly s work on steady state economics yet in the process he ignores to a greater extent than daly the barrier that capitalism poses to such a future as fred magdoff and john bellamy foster have noted there is however one slight problem with this capitalist no growth utopia it violates the basic motive force of capitalism a stationary state or steady state economy as a stable solution is only conceivable if separated from the social relations of capital itself 5 without an understanding of these social relations heinberg is left to explain political failures as reductionist human nature warning of reactionary responses to mass suffering under higher energy prices and hoping for political foresight and planning without any firm basis for how to achieve such a revolutionary divergence from our current trajectory heinberg proposes a transition in which the primary financial stakeholders in society including weapons manufacturers banks and fossil fuel companies are engaged in the transition rather than marginalized as otherwise they would likely derail the effort 162 yet how and why these companies would be convinced to adopt policies focused on human needs within the limitations of a steady state contrary to their current reasons for existence profits and growth is left a mystery as is the political force causing nations to abandon imperialism in favor of cooperation still what is compelling about heinberg s flawed argument is his sense of the real urgency of the modern coal question it may be tempting to think of coal as a transitional energy source for the next few decades while a longer term energy strategy emerges but in that case an important question arises will there be sufficient investment capital and technical resources in three or four decades to fund the transition to the next energy source whatever it may be the transition if deferred will thus be more expensive and difficult than it would be now indeed the longer a transition to an ultimate and sustainable energy source regime is put off the harder that transition becomes 53 for those committed to preventing ecological disasters associated with climate change the effects of declining coal reserves and the shift to lower quality coal that this entails are important to consider in light of both their ecological and economic consequences from this standpoint environmentalists such as heinberg concerned primarily with anticipating and planning for the peaking of fossil fuels in a way that avoids ecological catastrophe and allows for continued human development must come to recognize that faced with limited natural resources there is no rational way to prioritize under a modern capitalist system in which the well to do with their economic leverage decide via the market how commodities are allocated 6 contrary to heinberg s best wishes war profiteers wall street and big oil cannot simply be presented with a rational plan and be expected to comply building a political movement broad and inspiring enough to tackle the new coal question on a platform of social justice requires gaining democratic control of government industry education and media messaging this means directly challenging the dominance of capital in each sphere blackout offers scholars and activists an overview of projections on future coal production and their complexities but social movements will need to look elsewhere for what is to be done about the historical burden of our coal question the question of a post carbon future is inextricably connected to the question of a post capitalist future monthly review

mexican peso holds bearish bias versus us dollar trades at lowest in over a month bank of mexico releases minutes from its latest meeting the usd mxn rose from near 19 50 to 19 65 reaching the highest level in almost two months afterward it pulled back modestly and it is trading at 19 61 posting gains for the fourth day in a row technical factors trade deals uncertainty and the latin american situation continue to support the upside in the pair from a technical perspective it continues to break important resistance levels adding support to the bullish run at the moment is testing the 19 64 zone a consolidation above would clear the way to more gains regarding fundamentals latin american currencies continue to underperform amid the ongoing social situation in many countries the chilean peso and the brazilian real hit record lows versus the us dollar trade headlines limit the optimism about the mexican peso the us mexico canada trade deal has not yet passed the us congress also us china trade tensions affect market sentiment damaging the demand for high yielding currencies like mxn banxico minutes at the last meeting the bank of mexico lowered the key interest rate by 25 basis points according to the minutes most members noted that in an environment of marked uncertainty the balance of risks to growth continues biased to the downside regarding inflation some members pointed out as a possible indicator of lower inflationary pressures the fact that the producer price index was 0 6 in october as compared to the same month of the previous year noting that this rate is the lowest observed since august 2015 overall most members agreed that uncertainty still persists regarding the risks that could make inflation deviate from its foreseen trajectory at the meeting two members voted for a 50 basis points rate cut one of them gerardo esquivel mentioned it is worth remembering that mexico is an atypical case since it is the only latin american country that has inflation close to target and simultaneously maintains a tight monetary policy stance for this reason i believe that on this occasion it was possible and desirable to reduce the interest rate by 50 basis points without jeopardizing or compromising banco de méxico s fundamental mandate under the current economic conditions a 25 basis point reduction is not enough and comes in too late in the same perspective jonathan ernest heath who also voted for a larger cut argued there is a wide margin of maneuver even if considering that the balance of risks for inflation despite being well balanced in the short term is uncertain in a longer time horizon
the international monetary fund imf on wednesday for the third time this year expressed concerns over the rising debt profile of nigeria saying that the debt to gross domestic product ratio at 28 percent has increased the imf senior resident representative and mission chief for nigeria mr amine mati stated this at the public presentation of the fall 2019 issue of the regional economic outlook for sub saharan africa in lagos though he said the ratio was still below the average for sub saharan africa and africa as a whole he called on the federal government to increase its drive to create more jobs and revamp its fiscal consolidation he said nigeria s debt has increased but the level is way below the average for the region even if we include the cbn overdraft and others we are talking about a debt to gdp ratio that does not go beyond 27 to 28 per cent to gdp and that is including amcon overdrafts and others read also nigeria s central bank monetary policy committee retains benchmark rate at 13 5 for resource intensive countries and the non resource intensive countries one thing that is common is that when there is trade shock they have to react so you lose revenues debt goes up in most countries you would see debt is about 50 per cent to gdp and has increased since 2016 in all cases but what is new is that most of the countries are back on a sustainable path and have plans to reduce debt through fiscal consolidation and they seem to have stabilised the growth in per capita to the gdp since 2016 has been sustained for the 12 group of countries and has stayed sluggish for the group of countries because they have to be dealing with trade shock and how they respond to the shock has also affected what is their path it would be recalled that in april at the joint annual spring meetings with the world bank in washington dc the imf had expressed worry over nigeria s ability to repay its foreign debt which was put at n24 387tn also in october the imf at another forum called for an effective debt management strategy that would ensure that the amount borrowed posed limited risk and the funds deployed for developmental purposes join the conversation opinions support ripples nigeria hold up solutions journalism balanced fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs as a media platform we hold leadership accountable and will not trade the right to press freedom and free speech for a piece of cake if you like what we do and are ready to uphold solutions journalism kindly donate to the ripples nigeria cause your support would help to ensure that citizens and institutions continue to have free access to credible and reliable information for societal development donate now
latin america has already captured the attention of china and it s likely that this attention will grow from other apac countries in the coming years opinions expressed by entrepreneur contributors are their own you re reading entrepreneur asia pacific an international franchise of entrepreneur media before 2000 there was little trade and business activity between asia pacific apac countries and latin america the two regions not only differ drastically when it comes to culture and language but the physical distance between them also plays a role in relations however in recent years there has been a steady uptick in trade partnerships and business activity according to research from the asian development bank institute trade between apac and lac countries is expected to continue growing reaching at least 750 billion by 2020 both regions boast complementary advantages for businesses including ample natural resources affordable labor and large markets with growing middle classes latin america s agricultural exports are increasingly supporting apac s economic growth meanwhile apac s competitively priced goods and services are increasingly welcomed in latin america populations in both regions are also coming online at a comparable pace one gmsa report forecasts that 73 per cent of the asia pacific population will be connected via mobile devices by 2025 similarly the mobile adoption rate in latin america is projected to reach 74 per cent by 2025 trade agreements such as mercosur and the pacific alliance are helping latin america better position itself in the global economy and enter new markets such as asia today there are 25 free trade agreements ftas between the apac and lac regions up from just two ftas in 2004 by 2025 that number is expected to reach 36 led by chile which has the most ftas with asia pacific countries latin america presents many exciting opportunities for apac businesses looking for growth however latin america is a big place and no two countries are alike to launch and operate in the region successfully apac businesses need to understand the opportunities and barriers that each country presents for instance some latin american countries are more business friendly than others meanwhile trade agreements geography infrastructure and network connectivity differences must all be taken into consideration as well here s a look at the countries that currently serve as the best gateways into latin america for apac businesses chile though not without its challenges chile s geographic proximity longstanding trade relations and typically stable business environment make it an attractive entry point for apac businesses in 2019 chile ranked 56 among 190 economies on the ease of doing business report the south american country currently has eight ftas with asian economies as well chile is one of the most promising markets for asian businesses in latin america the online marketplace aliexpress which is owned by alibaba found a way to fulfill a need among chilean consumers for quality reasonably priced products the online retailer launched in chile and is now a leading source of exposure for chinese businesses looking to sell their products in chile with more than 70 of chileans connected to the internet the success of aliexpress is proof that e commerce in chile is still largely untapped chile s widespread mobile and internet connections are also playing a key role in the mobility and transportation sector in 2018 china s bike sharing service mobike launched in santiago chile and quickly dominated the market mobike now operates in multiple cities across the country with more than 330 000 users peru peru ranked 68 out of 190 countries on the 2019 ease of doing business report and presents an attractive fast growing market for apac businesses approximately 90 of peru s exports are covered by ftas five of which are with asian economies peru is a member of the asia pacific economic cooperation apec and a member of a number of other organizations tied to east asian countries despite challenges with underdeveloped infrastructure and public services the peruvian government is promoting entrepreneurial activity and attracting foreign businesses and investment in december 2018 chinese fiber optic company yofc announced it would begin the installation of six broadband networks across peru that would bring more than one million people and 3 300 public institutions high speed internet and intranet the government has also initiated programs such as startup peru which offers funding for innovative high impact companies mexico mexico chile colombia and peru make up the pacific alliance which has become a significant driver of positive lac asia relations in 2017 the pacific alliance announced the inclusion of three asia pacific countries australia new zealand and singapore further solidifying ties between the two regions mexico is home to one of latin america s largest middle classes mexico s healthy business environment and proximity to the us make it a favorite among foreign investors according to the 2019 ease of doing business report mexico ranked 54 among 190 economies mexico s ftas are also important for apac businesses one example is the japan mexico fta which provides access to the us via the north american free trade agreement as the 14th largest country in the world mexico stands out as a leader in several industries including energy automotive production and financial technology it s estimated that by 2050 mexico will be the 7th largest economy in the world many technology firms are entering latin america through mexico including china s leading car service company didi chuxing didi chuxing entered latin america in 2017 by acquiring 99 a brazilian taxi and ride sharing application and adapting it to the mexican market noticias aguila a news aggregator developed by shenzhen inveno technology set up an office in mexico and attracted over 20 million users in less than two years becoming one of the biggest mobile media platforms in latin america latin america now open for business across latin america middle classes are emerging consumers are increasingly shopping online and governments are adjusting to consumer demands for more accessible and affordable products and services latin america has already captured the attention of china and it s likely that this attention will grow from other apac countries in the coming years many of the partnerships and trade agreements mentioned are still in the development stage however the vast gaps between the two regions are closing rapidly and exciting new opportunities for businesses to seize are emerging
jonathan swift once modestly proposed alleviating the irish famine by dining on the young i have been assured by a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasee or a ragoust for bernie sanders elizabeth warren alexandria ocasio cortez and others on the left what s on the menu this year is billionaires surely cannibalizing the wealthy will provide a far more satisfying feast than children they somehow never tell us who will be on the menu next year after we ve finished feasting on bill gates polished off bezos on a bun and made pot pie from whatever s left over from devouring warren buffet a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don t have access to public health is wrong ocasio cortez told an mlk event her senior policy staffer dan riffle actually changed his twitter handle to every billionaire is a policy failure whether its global warming solutions socialized medicine loan forgiveness racial reparations or just plain old redistribution free stuff every day we hear calls on the left for new spending that totals high into the trillions when asked how to pay for it they pretend their largesse won t cost you or me a dime by calling for wealth taxes on the richest americans left wing math never adds up it s one of the main reasons that socialism is so effective at laying nations low let s check the billionaire facts bloomberg and forbes maintain lists that track the daily wealth of the the world s richest people today they peg bill gates at around 96 billion and jeff bezos at a stunning 131 billion why not confiscate all of it today we could immediately end hunger and homelessness shout the furthest left why limit ourselves to a mere warren or sanders style 2 5 annual confiscation if we set aside envy as a powerful motivating force by a crucial measue the world s two richest men aren t as wealthy as you might think a billionaire s wealth may be vast when compared to that of an average american including everyone at cfact but pales when compared to the vast sums spent every day by government the u s debt clock reveals america s national debt at over 23 trillion dollars confiscating bill gate s 96 billion would reduce the debt from 23 trillion and 75 billion dollars to 22 trillion and 979 billion with gates down to zero we can go on working our way down the rich list grabbing taking and redistributing as if the left would do anything as responsible with a one time windfall as pay off debt now what the federal government spends four and a half trillion dollars per year combine that with state and local governments and we re spending over 8 14 trillion per year jeff bezos and bill gates may be the world s two richest men they are pipsqueaks when measured against leviathan the states are in debt for one and three quarter trillion dollars and have unfunded pension liablities of 6 8 trillion gates and bezos both hail from washington state which is on track to spend over 94 billion this year and is over 89 billion in debt confiscate everything they have and they can pay the evergreen state s finances for one year then the money s gone and to a great extent amazon and microsoft along with it the deep thinkers on the left apparently think that gates and bezos keep their money in a big box we could open and share their wealth is actually found in the value of the businesses they created and the investments they ve made since imagine the economic earthquake were it all suddenly gone while the left still dips into the well of marx and engels when they theorize about our economy their recent favorite is french economist thomas pikkety whose book capital in the twenty first century topped the new york times best sellers list in that and other books pikkety proposes high taxation to level economic inequality with the curious notion that governments can allocate resources more efficiently than individuals economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman are the architeccts of elizabeth warren s proposed wealth tax in their just released the triumph of injustice they call for massive increases in income and wealth taxes to create what they call tax justice to stop wealth accumulating with hardly any barrier a small group of fashionably left wing very rich people have issued a call for confiscatory taxes on wealth to level the playing field twenty of them including the ever controversial george soros and the granddaughter of roy disney signed an open letter to the 2020 presidential candidates it s time to tax us more although abigail disney received a class traitor award for her activism none of the signatories has led the way by voluntarily giving away enough of their wealth to join the ranks of the average liesel pritzker simmons one of the heirs of a fortune that stems largely from hyatt hotels signed the letter as did ian simmons heir to one time retail giant montgomery ward and molly munger daughter of berkshire hathaway s charlie munger they believe that their wealth could be allocated more efficiently by the democratic processes of government none of these spoiled scions of wealth seem to reflect much on how much societal good was created by their uber creative forebears consider the massive economic contributions of disney hyatt montgomery ward and berkshire hathaway could committees of government planners have housed fed clothed and entertained us better mark zuckerberg hasn t had his 70 billion fortune long and he is still coming to grips with it i think if you do something that s good you get rewarded he recently said but i do think some of the wealth that can be accumulated is unreasonable zuckerberg himself however is a powerful argument for free markets unless it is your belief that a government planning committee could have done a better job of creating an online social network that could link billions of people together or even have conceived that such a thing could exist for those who think government economic decision making is more efficient than free markets and have never visited the dmv the lessons of history are plain to see well they would be if history was still taught in schools soviet style economic planning failed miserably india and china stagnated for half a century under democratic socialism and full blown communism respectively only the embrace of free market competition allowed them to advance people flee from north korea to the south never the other way round the venezuelan example couldn t be more fresh the new american left makes intuitive assumptive leaps that don t hold up for instance the americans who top the billionaire lists are overwhelmigly recent additions bezos gates warren buffet larry ellison mark zuckerberg michael bloomberg larry page sergey brin and not the heirs of inter generational wealth which seldom lasts the walton family fortune got going in the 1960s the koch family in the 1920s any professional fundraiser can tell you that inter generational wealth in america seldom lasts beyond three generations if you search the billionaire lists you won t find any rockefellers duponts astors morgans cabots lowells or guggenheims you won t find the descendants of thomas edison nor his rival westinghouse dennis washington is number 290 on the forbes list with an estmiated forture of 5 9 billion he is a self made man in construction with no financial connection to george washington and his mt vernon wealth you won t find any franklins adams hancocks jeffersons or madisons atop the rich list you won t even find any roosevelts the left relies on misleading factoids to justify their weath inequality push the foundation for economic education did a great job of debunking one of them consider this whopper three us billionaires are now collectively worth more than the 160 million americans in the bottom half of the wealth distribution few of the bottom 160 million hold any stocks or bonds how do they come up with this one by using demographics to lump together kids and students with prisoners the disabled and people who do not save most kids and teenagers haven t started building their nest eggs yet the figure that results is meaningless you know who else has more money than the hundreds of millions of kids and people with zero or negative net worths combined elizabeth warren and bernie sanders whom forbes pegs as possessing 12 million and 2 3 million respectively to put it in left wing propaganda terms bernie sanders has more wealth than the bottom half of america combined as monty python s dennis moore said wait a tic blimey this redistribution of wealth is trickier than i thought should we feast on billionaires this thanksgiving aesop told a story of a goose that every day laid a golden egg the couple that owned it cut it open to extract all the gold at once but found only an ordinary dead goose inside that was the end of the golden eggs as margaret thatcher famously said the trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people s money who s nest egg do you think they ll crack next

via caixin china s central government has issued new bond quotas for 2020 to some provincial level governments early as the state seeks to fund infrastructure construction in a bid to shore up a flagging economy several financial officials in provincial level governments told caixin they have already received next year s quotas of so called special purpose bonds from the finance ministry special purpose bonds are designated for investment in infrastructure and public livelihood projects and should be repaid from income generated by those projects not from local budgets bond selling by local governments has accelerated this year as the national economy faces downward pressure due to low demand and a trade war with the united states local governments almost used up their bond quotas for 2019 in the first nine months and the state council china s cabinet has asked them to submit documents detailing how much debt they need to sell next year three months in advance apart from bond selling the state council has decided to relax financing requirements for some infrastructure projects cutting the minimum capital ratio requirement for ports and shipping infrastructure projects from 25 to 20 of the total investment however infrastructure investment has not yet rebounded as expected government driven infrastructure investment rose 4 2 year on year in the first 10 months of the year down from 4 5 in the first nine months more at reuters this is a big decision which means that the government is pretty worried about the downward pressure on the economy said hua changchun analyst at guotai junan securities currently speaking the economy has not been effectively stabilized yet tang jianwei senior economist at bank of communications in shanghai said faster local government bond issuance could help underpin infrastructure investment but he cautioned against any quick impact on the economy special bonds could help stabilize investment but any impact may not be felt until the first quarter he said advertisement they should be real estate is still set to slow and the deleveraging campaign casualties are mouting at the ft troubled banks have been able to secure only 20 40 per cent of the funds they have sought to raise in the interbank market for negotiable certificates of deposit a vital source of funding for many smaller lenders since the takeover of baoshang bank according to research from ubs they clearly have some liquidity issues said may yan ubs s head of greater china financials equity research some of china s weakest banks have been forced to offer up the country s highest yields on investment products in a sign of desperation to raise funds bank of jinzhou which received a partial bailout from icbc in july offers investors a 4 83 per cent return on wealth management products it sells the highest rate in the country according to data compiled by rong360 an online financial services group bank of dandong which was hit by us sanctions for links to north korea in 2017 will pay 4 43 per cent on wealth management products bank of dalian which has been bailed out twice since 2015 offers up 4 29 per cent on investment products putting it among the top 10 highest offerings on bank investment products this means investors do not fully trust the government interventions said alicia garcía herrero chief asia pacific economist at natixis the market is saying there are serious doubts about these banks wiping out your profitability is no way to stabilise a bank previously via wsj advertisement over the weekend china s harbin bank said it was now under government control that comes months after chinese authorities seized control of another small lender baoshang bank and state institutions took stakes in a third bank of jinzhou bank runs have erupted elsewhere several other lenders have yet to file 2018 annual reports in another sign that the problems are more widespread here s how china s banking system works and what s going wrong china s banks come in various flavors there are a handful of giants and a few more medium size banks that can also operate nationally below that lies a bigger cohort of city commercial banks and more than a thousand tiny rural commercial lenders both city and rural banks have their roots in local credit unions and tend to have limited geographic reach cracks are emerging at some small and midsize banks after years of rapid growth compared to the big four small and mid sized banks rely more on wholesale funding such as the bond repo and interbank markets smaller banks lent liberally to local governments and businesses and bad debts are rising as china s economy sputters poor governance probably created problems at some banks too such as hengfeng bank in late 2017 the official xinhua news agency citing a company statement said hengfeng chairman cai guohua was being investigated for alleged serious violation of discipline and law there may be reassuring noises coming from regulators but seizing busted banks every few weeks is hardly that nor is this also last week at cnbc china s central bank unexpectedly trimmed a closely watched lending rate on monday the first such cut in more than four years and a signal to markets that policymakers are ready to act to prop up slowing growth the people s bank of china pboc said on its website that it was lowering the seven day reverse repurchase rate to 2 50 from 2 55 the move cheered china s bond market and comes just two weeks after the pboc cut the borrowing cost on its medium term lending facility mlf used by banks for longer dated funding needs by the same margin both cuts raise the likelihood that the pboc will trim its new benchmark loan prime rate lpr off of which many lenders base their mortgage rates

in many ways 2019 has been a miserable year for the world economy with trade wars geopolitical instability and slowing growth yet global investors in fact have much to celebrate this year no matter where they invested their money if you tease apart the reasons for that apparent contradiction why this stock market surge looks different from others in the recent past you find some important evidence for where global economies are likely to be heading wall street has been surging ever since a recession scare in august and was up 25 per cent for the year at tuesday s close in australia the benchmark s p asx200 hit record highs on thursday the surge has coincided with falling long term interest rates and higher bond prices for example a popular fund that invests in all types of bonds the ishares core total usd bond market etf has returned 9 per cent so far in 2019 on the new york stock exchange last week wall street has been surging ever since a recession scare in august in australia the local benchmark index hit record highs on thursday credit ap the boom is a lot broader than that nearly every major asset class has offered returns over the course of the year that are at a minimum solid and in some cases extraordinary whether real estate investment trusts commodity funds or emerging market stocks widely held funds in those three categories had returned 27 per cent 11 per cent and 12 per cent from the start of the year through tuesday s close
washington dc the bicycle theory used to be a metaphor for international trade policy just as standing still on a bicycle is not an option one must keep moving forward or else fall over so it was said that trade negotiators must engage in successive rounds of liberalisation otherwise global openness would gradually succumb to protectionist interests i don t know whether the theory was right in fact had governments stood still on trade policy over the last three years the world would be a lot better off than it is now trade is faltering global volumes are down a remarkable 1 1 per cent over the last 12 months as inept bikers collide chaotically with one another once competent riders are again in charge they could do worse than return to the post world war ii formula of negotiating the reciprocal elimination of tariffs the suggestion sounds old fashioned after all another familiar truism is that shallow integration removing obvious trade barriers such as tariffs and quotas is largely complete and that further progress now requires deep integration or mutually agreed rules for regulating the business environment but that agenda despite its potential merits now appears too ambitious a classic example of deep integration was the decision by the member states of the european common market to go beyond free trade and pursue a full european union eu and even a common currency that was evidently an over reach politically at least for the brexit plagued uk a current attempt at deep integration is the united states government s demand that china stop requiring american companies to share their proprietary technology as a condition for entering joint ventures with local firms many american economists support this demand but argue that us president donald trump has gone about it all wrong the sensible strategy would have been for the us to make common cause with other major governments to put pressure on china preferably via multilateral institutions such as the world trade organisation german carmakers of course have as much at stake in china as american firms do yet even a future us president who took a better approach probably would not succeed for one thing regulating technology transfer would be very tricky in the best of worlds typically there is no explicit quid pro quo initiated by the chinese firm much less by the chinese government often the foreign corporation is the one that offers to share technology to make itself attractive to a local firm as a joint venture partner how could a government regulate such a subtle process the answer may be for the chinese government to eliminate the requirement that foreign firms doing business in china must have a local partner in fact the authorities have recently taken steps in this direction in the financial and automotive sectors simpler yet would have been for china to remove its long standing tariffs on automobile imports so that us and german carmakers could have exported directly to the chinese market as an alternative to setting up production facilities there not only would this outcome have been simpler it also would have benefited american and german workers directly so let s go back to good old tariff negotiations the us should remove all the tariffs it has imposed over the last few years on washing machines solar panels steel aluminum automobiles and myriad other products in return china should of course rescind its own retaliatory measures for example against us exports of soybeans pork and other farm products turning the clock back to january 2017 would be a big improvement but we should not stop there the earlier conventional wisdom always overestimated the extent of shallow integration governments should move towards free trade in motor vehicles and as many other sectors as possible a sector especially suited for liberalisation is solar panels turbines and other renewable energy inputs ironically many governments that purport to care about the environment maintain trade barriers that increase the cost of protecting it the eu china and the us are leading offenders a damaging trump policy that will need to be reversed is his abuse of the national security exception to justify protectionist trade measures the international trade system had previously allowed each government to interpret this exception as they saw fit most applied it judiciously knowing that abuse would encourage others to behave similarly but under trump any sector of the economy from automobiles to peanut butter apparently qualifies as essential to national security new international negotiations should clarify exactly what qualifies none of this addresses the problem that trade creates losers as well as winners something that we all supposedly had forgotten until we needed to explain how trump won the 2016 us presidential election let s hope that now three years later we have learned that tariffs also create losers as well as winners and many more of the former in the case of trump s trade war get tough trade policies are not a solution to the problem of inequality moreover trade is only one of many factors that contribute to inequality and regardless of the relative importance of each cause the list of practical remedies is pretty much the same in the us it includes expansion of health insurance pre school for all children infrastructure investment competition policy a restoration of post 2008 financial regulations and more progressive taxation some say that the us should raise trade barriers until it is ready to enact such policies but that is a non sequitur we should implement as many of these share the gains measures as we can while also ending the trade war and in the future we free traders may need to be satisfied with an agenda of eliminating tariffs and quotas deep integration it turns out is perhaps a bridge too far jeffrey frankel professor of capital formation and growth at harvard university

sterling rebounds as no deal risk declines the pound stabilised this month near 1 30 after a recovery in october from the summer woes that pushed sterling down below 1 20 and almost to parity against the euro to the relief of holidaymakers going to the continent the pound now stands at 1 18 the recovery was connected with the slowly evaporating threat of leaving the eu without a deal before the 31 october deadline support for sterling also came from poor economic figures from the eurozone which indicated the currency bloc was entering a period of stagnation a slowdown in the us also helped the pound s rebound this month currency traders have remained on guard against brexit developments but with the election in full swing they must wait until its conclusion before the uk s relationship with the eu becomes a little clearer share prices lose ground against europe and the us shares in london hit a 12 month peak in july before entering a jittery period that continued last month concerns over britain s future trading arrangements was the main cause but figures showing the uk economy slowing down also dragged on share values the index of britain s top 100 companies dropped as low as 7 200 over the last month and only rarely pushed above 7 400 to fall well short of july s 7 700 high point stock markets across europe and the us have proved to be much more buoyant shrugging off the gloom to register strong gains the s p 500 in new york has risen almost 7 since august france is best performing major economy in europe this year and since august has seen its stock market the cac 40 rise by more than 10 even the struggling german stock market the dax ahead by 13 rise over the same period better than forecast inflation drops back after heavy discounting inflation dropped to 1 5 in october after a slide in fuel and energy prices heavy discounting at furniture stores also played a part in average prices rising more slowly along with price cuts across the recreation and culture sectors according to the office for national statistics core inflation which strips out volatile fuel costs stayed at 1 7 only marginally below the bank of england s target of 2 bank of england officials who meet eight times a year to set interest rates could cut the cost of borrowing in the new year if the decline continues but few city analysts believe a decision is imminent the higher level of core inflation was the result of increases in clothing and footwear that pulled down inflation from its recent peak of 3 1 in 2017 most forecasters predict inflation will stay steady for the next few months but could rise next year after a brexit deal likely to send the value of the pound down and the cost of imports up worse than forecast trade boosted by rise in exports britain s trade position improved in september after a 5 2 rise in exports that narrowed the trade gap but not by as much as city economists had hoped much of the increase came from the services sector after increases in the export of business services intellectual property financial services and travel consultancy work a 4 3bn increase in goods exports to 89 7bn was driven largely by machinery and transport equipment and chemicals but the ons said it was concerned about its own data and how it showed a surge in exports when other indicators pointed in the opposite direction the ons also highlighted how the annual trend had worsened over the last 12 months the total trade deficit widened by almost 19bn to 51 6bn poorer exports would also fit with the trends in global trade which has declined since it became clear that the us president donald trump was serious about launching a full blown economic war with china the oecd the paris based club for the wealthiest 36 nations said earlier this month that global growth was likely to slow to 2 9 this year before stabilising in 2020 and rising back to 3 in 2021 worse than forecast business activity has sharpest drop since the referendum a long slide into recession seemed inevitable after figures from the ihs markit cips purchasing managers index showed all areas of britain s private sector entering a period of contraction a flash publication of the index covering about 85 of business activity in manufacturing and the services industry showed that in november uk companies had the sharpest drop in activity since the eu referendum most businesses blamed the situation on faltering confidence among both domestic and overseas customers who are worn out by continuing political indecision not since july 2016 and the weeks after the eu referendum have businesses cut back on new orders and production to such an extent analysts said the onset of a general election added to brexit related uncertainty and helped to erode business confidence worse than forecast employment levels fall at fastest rate for four years employment in the uk fell at its fastest rate in four years in the three months to september and pay growth slid backwards leading to speculation that brexit uncertainty was taking its toll on the jobs market the ons said employment had fallen by 58 000 during the third quarter of 2019 the biggest fall since may 2015 a 93 000 drop in female employment appeared to indicate the trouble faced by high street stores which employ large numbers of women and have closed at an alarming rate over the last year the number of men in employment increased by 35 000 meanwhile brexit uncertainty was also evident in the supply of labour with non eu nationals accounting for almost all the net growth in migrant employment over the past year pay growth fell to 3 6 from 4 in july worse than forecast retail spending weak before black friday a rash of price cutting in october on the high street and by online retailers failed to cheer consumers who surprised city analysts with a 0 1 drop purchases city analysts had expected heavy discounting by retailers to drive up sales instead the october figure for retail volumes represented the weakest monthly figure since april last year some analysts speculated that shoppers were reluctant to spend before the proposed 31 october brexit deadline others believed the prospect discount shopping on black friday and cyber monday later this month and christmas had deterred shoppers from spending vital cash in october there was also speculation that recent declines in employment and wages growth had deterred consumers from spending on big ticket items such as furniture and cars sales fell in all main retail sectors apart from food stores once petrol and diesel sales were stripped out the drop was even more severe at 0 3 department stores fared a little better than over the previous year but the rise in sales was modest compared with the battering these large outlets have faced as shoppers desert the high street in favour worse than forecast public finances hit by brexit spending extra government spending since last year on brexit preparations the health service and a welter of new posts in whitehall has dented the public purse and pushed ministers deficit reduction plans off course figures covering last month showed that government borrowing rose to its highest october level in five years as the shortfall hit 11 2bn up 2 3bn on a year earlier the ons said borrowing in the first seven months of the 2019 20 financial year was 46 3bn an increase of 4 3bn on the same period in 2018 19 not only was spending up but tax receipts were almost flat at just 0 4 higher from the same month last year with the weakness spread across vat and taxes on income and companies city analysts said the annual shortfall was only going to get larger once the next government has begun to include its election promises in the calculation before the election the chancellor sajid javid had already announced the budget deficit in 2020 21 would be lifted appreciably by a 13 8bn increase to public spending 4 1 in real terms and the fastest increase in 15 years better than forecast house prices on hold while buyers wait and see house prices have remained steady in most parts of the country over the last year despite brexit uncertainty but while the asking price of a home has moved sideways in many areas the number of properties coming on to the market has fallen sharply rightmove reported that new listings dropped by nearly 15 this month in what was the largest year on year slump in any month since august 2009 across britain the average asking price is 302 808 the recent worries over brexit also hit the average price tag which fell by 3 900 in november the equivalent of a 1 decline on the previous month agents said there was an element of wait and see among would be buyers partly in response to the looming christmas break but also the prospect of a new government under boris johnson cutting level of stamp duty for first time buyers and another thing we ve learned this month the services sector is keeping the economy afloat the monthly snapshot of economic growth made grim ready in september the ons said gdp declined by 0 1 after a 0 2 fall in august however a bumper july kept the three month figure to september in positive territory at plus 0 3 helping to offset a 0 2 fall in the three months to the end of june and give a six month growth rate of 0 1 the manufacturing and construction sectors were the main areas of weakness as brexit uncertainty pushed firms to cut back production and an increasing number to go bankrupt construction firms topped the table of corporate insolvencies but manufacturers were not far behind the services sector which accounts for three quarters of economic activity kept the economy afloat though the main boost came from the higher wages they paid to workers rather than higher order

tara templin tiago cravo oliveira hashiguchi blake thomson joseph dieleman eran bendavid abstract background in high income countries obesity prevalence body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg m2 is highest among the poor while overweight body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kg m2 is prevalent across all wealth groups in contrast in low income countries the prevalence of overweight and obesity is higher among wealthier individuals than among poorer individuals we characterize the transition of overweight and obesity from wealthier to poorer populations as countries develop and project the burden of overweight and obesity among the poor for 103 countries methods and findings our sample used 182 demographic and health surveys and world health surveys n 2 24 million respondents from 1995 to 2016 we created a standard wealth index using household assets common among all surveys and linked national wealth by country and year identifiers we then estimated the changing probability of overweight and obesity across every wealth decile as countries per capita gross domestic product gdp rises using logistic and linear fixed effect regression models we found that obesity rates among the wealthiest decile were relatively stable with increasing national wealth and the changing gradient was largely due to increasing obesity prevalence among poorer populations 3 5 to 14 3 overweight prevalence among the richest 45 0 and the poorest 45 5 were roughly equal in high income settings at 8 000 gdp per capita the adjusted probability of being obese was no longer highest in the richest decile and the same was true of overweight at 10 000 above 25 000 individuals in the richest decile were less likely than those in the poorest decile to be obese and the same was true of overweight at 50 000 we then projected overweight and obesity rates by wealth decile to 2040 for all countries to quantify the expected rise in prevalence in the relatively poor our projections indicated that if past trends continued the number of people who are poor and overweight will increase in our study countries by a median 84 4 range 3 54 383 4 most prominently in low income countries the main limitations of this study included the inclusion of cross sectional self reported data possible reverse causality of overweight and obesity on wealth and the lack of physical activity and food price data conclusions our findings indicate that as countries develop economically overweight prevalence increased substantially among the poorest and stayed mostly unchanged among the wealthiest the relative poor in upper and lower middle income countries may have the greatest burden indicating important planning and targeting needs for national health programs author summary why was this study done obesity prevalence has been rising in every country in the world since 1975 and contributes to an increasing proportion of noncommunicable disease risk and burden within countries obesity prevalence is highest among wealthier population strata in poorer countries but the burden of obesity shifts to poorer population strata as national wealth increases while the flipped wealth gradients of obesity in poor and rich countries are documented no research shows how this shift happens or where it occurs along the range of economic development this work was motivated by a desire to inform policy makers of when and how this reversal is likely to occur because obesity among the poor has different implications for public health policy than obesity among the wealthy what did the researchers do and find we collated 182 demographic and health surveys and world health surveys from 103 countries with information on respondent height weight personal wealth and country wealth we estimated the relationship of personal wealth with overweight and obesity and examined how that relationship varies with country wealth at a gross domestic product gdp per capita of 8 000 the prevalence of obesity is no longer the highest among those in the top wealth decile 10 000 for overweight and at 30 000 obesity prevalence among those in the poorest decile is higher than among the wealthiest 50 000 for overweight the transition is driven by increasing obesity among the poor without appreciable decreasing obesity among the wealthy above 10 000 gdp per capita the relationship between overweight and personal wealth starts to change as overweight prevalence among those in the lower deciles of wealth increases we estimate that 70 2 64 1 76 4 of countries will begin or have undergone this shift by 2040 and the number of people who are both obese and poor in the lowest quintile in our study countries will increase by 17 3 million people 15 3 19 6 what do these findings mean distinct points along the obesity transition may represent a particularly effective time for policy makers to implement obesity interventions at a gdp per capita of 8 000 the burden of paying for the costs of obesity may start to increase as the prevalence of obesity is no longer uniquely concentrated among the wealthy people in the richest decile may not be affected by the same economic mechanisms that increase obesity in the poor as obesity prevalence of the wealthy within each country does not change substantially with economic development citation templin t cravo

strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology introduction since 1975 the worldwide prevalence of overweight body mass index bmi greater than or equal to 25 kg m2 among adults increased from 21 5 to 38 9 in 2016 over this period no country has experienced a decline in the prevalence of overweight or obesity bmi greater than or equal to 30 kg m2 in 2000 the world health organization declared obesity a pandemic and 12 years later issued a global action plan to combat its rise the rapid rise in overweight and the inefficacy of population level control measures are thought to be important drivers of the rising disease burden and mortality from cardiovascular disease cancer and diabetes unlike many health conditions such as diarrheal illnesses and respiratory infections in which the poor consistently carry a disproportionate share of the health burden irrespective of national aggregate wealth overweight and obesity do not display a consistent wealth gradient across different levels of economic development in most low and middle income countries the prevalence of overweight and obesity is higher among wealthier individuals than among poorer however as national economic output increases the burden of overweight and obesity shifts to populations with lower personal wealth the question of at what point along the spectrum of national economic development the burden of overweight and obesity shifts to the poor is thus an important one which has received limited attention this shift in overweight and obesity burden from the rich to the poor is an important consequence of economic development yet it receives little policy attention industrialization urbanization and the nutritional transition are commonly posited as drivers of overweight and obesity with increasing country wealth these studies suggest that food consumption patterns change differentially in different wealth strata as countries become wealthier while there is no singular reason for these trends increased supply of processed food greater integration into the global economy brings more processed foods price differences per calorie processed foods are less costly than non processed foods and personal wealth changes could all be associated with changing patterns in food consumption along with worse healthcare and worse health outcomes more overweight among the relatively poor is a major issue confronting public health programs this shift in burden has three direct implications first characterizing the overweight and obesity burden shift is fundamental to understanding its drivers including the economic and nutritional drivers second the measurement of burden inequities can inform understanding of the changing distribution of cardiometabolic diseases third the mix of available and effective interventions to prevent overweight and treat overweight related diseases may vary based on the personal wealth of those in need indicating important planning and targeting needs for national health programs in this analysis we aim to identify a wealth overweight transition zone which is a term we will use to denote the range of gross domestic product gdp per capita where overweight burden shifts within countries from the wealthy to the poor this work contributes to the extant literature by characterizing the wealth overweight transition zone with potential implications for mitigation strategies the analysis has three aims to 1 characterize overweight and obesity wealth gradients as countries develop economically 2 identify the range of gdp per capita where the transition occurs and 3 project overweight and obesity burden transitions to 2040 methods data sources we extracted data from two series of surveys the demographic and health surveys and the world health surveys these are household cross sectional surveys that employ a multistage sampling design the demographic and health surveys collect anthropometrically measured height and weight from all respondents as well as a series of asset indicators meant to capture personal wealth the world health surveys collect mostly self reported height and weight measurements along with many asset indicators from these sources we compiled 182 surveys representing 103 countries across different time points from 1995 to 2015 a total of 2 24 million survey respondents aged 15 49 were included in the sample detailed information concerning the surveys can be found in tables a f and figs a b in s1 appendix measurements of overweight and obesity we categorized adults aged 18 and over with a bmi of 30 kg m2 or greater as obese and those with a bmi of 25 kg m2 or greater as overweight we will refer to overweight inclusive of obesity as overweight throughout the paper for survey respondents aged 15 17 classification was made according to the international obesity task force s growth curve adults with missing or implausible bmi measurements less than 12 or greater than 60 were excluded more information is available in s1 appendix section 2 6 height and weight data in the world health surveys are self reported and some studies have shown bias in self reporting of height and weight we conducted sensitivity analyses to test for systematic differences between overlapping demographic and health surveys and world health surveys and found no significant bias fig c and tables h j l in s1 appendix national income we used gdp per capita collected from the institute for health metrics and evaluation as a measure of national income in constant 2017 purchasing power parity adjusted dollars this data source also projects gdp for all countries in our study up to 2040 which we use to project overweight and obesity distribution trends the world health surveys include countries spanning from the democratic republic of the congo 1 000 per person per year to luxembourg 112 000 per person per year the demographic and health surveys focus mostly on low and middle income countries with gabon at 18 000 having the highest gdp per capita in that sample and the democratic republic of the congo 1 000 per person per year having the lowest we linked gdp per capita to surveys by country and year identifiers individual wealth index to capture personal wealth we constructed a household specific wealth index based on asset ownership first we collected survey specific wealth ranks meaning relative rank order of personal wealth within a country at the time of the survey based on asset inventories we use the relative personal wealth rank because we can obtain it directly from each of our 103 surveys using a premade demographic and health surveys or easily derived world health surveys index from principal components analyses of wealth questionnaire responses to calculate the first principal component we use all available asset indicators for each country and perform country specific principal component analyses as a robustness check we also calculate a second personal wealth index that is comparable across countries and years in order to obtain this second wealth index we perform principal components analysis on nine asset measures widely available in the demographic and health surveys water access sanitation floor material electricity refrigerator motorcycle car phone and rooms per person the personal wealth index is the first principal component which captures the maximal variance amongst these assets we then use the index scores across the entire study population across all surveys to calculate wealth deciles

within country changes we started with a fixed effects regression specification for both our wealth overweight transition estimation and projections additional sensitivity analyses and a meta analytic technique are described below this study is reported as per the strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology strobe guideline s1 checklist wealth overweight transition estimation we conducted multivariate regression analyses using the individual survey respondent as the unit of observation the purpose of these models is to estimate how the wealth overweight gradient changes with economic development we do this by estimating the following regression equation with a binomial outcome distribution and logit link function 1 where individuals are indexed by i country by c and year by t the main coefficients of interest δ w represent the changing probability of overweight in individuals in each wealth decile w with increasing gdp per capita logged individual controls include age in years and sex indicator for female we include country fixed effects μ c a series of binary indicators for each country and year fixed effects τ t a series of binary indicators for each year the country fixed effects remove all time invariant differences between countries and allow us to examine the changing relationship of personal wealth with overweight within countries that is we estimate how overweight changes for a single wealth decile in a single country as that country s gdp changes year fixed effects control for common time trends shared among all countries in effect allowing us to estimate our relationship of interest after removing global trends in overweight we estimate logistic models for the binary outcome variable of individual overweight and include findings with obesity and bmi as the dependent variables in tables g l in s1 appendix we also estimate the same model with country specific age and sex trends in fig e and wealth quintiles in fig f in s1 appendix finally we also conduct a meta regression analysis to estimate the relationship of gdp per capita to within country effects of wealth on overweight obesity and bmi available in figs g l and tables n s in s1 appendix wealth overweight transition projections after estimating the basic shift in overweight and obesity trends between the poor and wealthy we projected this shift to 2040 we project the overweight and obesity prevalence to 2040 of each sex and 5 year age groups from age 15 to 49 using eq 1 with a linear time trend we use gdp per capita projections from the institute for health metrics and evaluation to estimate the effect of economic development to 2040 we incorporated variance in the gdp per capita series and parameter uncertainty from our regression model to quantify an uncertainty interval for our projections after estimation of eq 1 we took 1 000 draws from the multivariate normal distribution defined by the model parameter estimates and the variance covariance matrix of the model to create our predictions those were coupled with 1 000 draws provided by the institute for health metrics and evaluation for their gdp per capita series these draws incorporate model data and parameter uncertainty by using ensemble modeling techniques drawing from the sub model variance covariance matrices and adding a random walk of statistical noise to each forecast with variance based on the residual of the observed data for each sub model we weight the predicted age sex specific overweight and obesity rates by the united nations world population prospects age sex specific population projections to aggregate overweight and obesity rates to the national level by personal wealth decile thus these projections also capture the effects of aging on overweight and obesity rates in table u in s1 appendix we report results for out of sample validation of these projections all analyses were conducted using stata 14 1 and r 3 5 0 results we collected

overweight compared with an individual in the richest decile the reference case at the gdp per capita of low income countries there was an increasing probability of overweight and obesity with personal wealth relative to individuals in the poorest decile the wealth overweight gradient began to shift at a gdp per capita around 10 000 i individuals in the richest decile no longer had the highest probability of obesity and ii the relative probability of being obese for individuals in the poorest deciles had roughly doubled compared with 500 gdp per capita this same shift happened in the obesity gradient at a gdp per capita of 8 000 finally around a gdp per capita of 50 000 individuals in the poorest deciles were more likely than the wealthiest decile to be overweight this point in the wealth obesity transition occurred at a gdp per capita of 25 000 fig 3 displays the projected relative change in the share of overweight by wealth decile between 1995 and 2040 grouped by world

1371 journal pmed 1002968 g004 more discussion this work documented that as per capita gdps increased from 10 000 to 50 000 the prevalence of overweight and obesity shifts from concentrating predominantly among individuals in the highest to those in all deciles of personal wealth in our adjusted specifications we noted that the rich no longer had the highest overweight rates at a gdp per capita of 10 000 around the current gdp per capita of namibia and paraguay we also identified another milestone of the wealth overweight transition around a gdp per capita of 50 000 where the wealthiest decile was less likely than the poorest decile to be overweight a similar transition occurred in obesity across a gdp per capita range from 8 000 to 25 000 by 2040 137 countries 125 149 were projected to reach 8 000 and enter the wealth overweight transition zone as countries develop economically we observed that along with rising overweight rates a larger fraction of the global overweight and obese populations become relatively poor this is important for policy makers as public health systems may be asked to shoulder the health and social consequences of overweight and obesity among those unable to cover the costs themselves the relatively poor in many countries have limited access to healthcare and worse health outcomes and this transition is one of both growing average burden and increasing health inequities the intuitive implications are that cardiometabolic diseases and related conditions associated with overweight and obesity could be shifting to the relatively poor and this has been occasionally documented moreover we found that the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the wealthiest decile had changed relatively little with increasing gdp per capita during the last 20 years this arguably unexpected finding would be consistent with a pattern in which individuals in wealthier strata are less affected by the mechanisms influencing the rise in overweight and obesity among the poor as countries develop economically one hypothesis for future work is that the wealthy may not change their food consumption as much as the poor in response to food prices or their physical activity levels may not change much with labor choices as economic development occurs it is also possible that the poor face changing supply side factors for example food deserts or food swamps as economic development occurs while the rich do not our projections while speculative suggest that if current trends and relationships continue the rise in the number of relatively poor individuals who are also overweight will be most pronounced in low and lower middle income countries over the next decade countries with currently very low gdp per capita particularly those in sub saharan africa are not projected to realize a full wealth overweight transition by 2040 yet there will still be substantial growth in overweight burden we projected that lower middle and upper middle income countries will experience the shift in obesity burden as their gdp per capita increases above 8 000 in addition lower income countries are projected to experience population growth not expected in higher income countries as life expectancy continues to rise especially in lower income countries one implication of this study is that the growing burden of obesity among the poor will translate to increased reliance on public health systems for cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and related chronic conditions these projections highlight that policy makers facing a growing burden of overweight related diseases among the relatively poor will need to design and implement interventions for a different target population than in the past specifically as economic development and globalization progress in low income countries overweight related care may be more widely demanded by the relatively poor if governments want to tackle the burden of overweight and associated conditions they must thus target their interventions at the poorest which may require different approaches and financing than if they were targeting the wealthy by planning for this reversal of the wealth gradient and subsequently different interventions policy makers will use public health resources in a cost effective manner in addition to reducing health disparities previous evidence suggests that sources of calorie intake differ across the relatively rich and poor with the poorest having lower quality diets than the richest while there are many possible explanations for this if within a particular country most of the health and economic burden of overweight and obesity is concentrated in the poor then national policy makers would focus on the sources of calorie intake that the poor are most likely to consume the same would be true in a different country where the burden is concentrated in the relatively rich population there are multiple policy instruments that might be effective tackling food deserts in low income neighborhoods subsidizing fruit and vegetables taxing sugar with a word of caution that this could be seen as a regressive tax with potentially positive health effects but negative effects on income inequality working with industry to reformulate their products where the industry and products on which a country would focus are distinct if overweight is concentrated in the rich or the poor even potentially ensuring safe places for people in low income neighborhoods to exercise and be outside from a public health perspective anticipating the disease burden is of the utmost importance this is true universally and especially in resource scarce environments this research and the accompanying wealth overweight transition highlight when overweight and obesity burdens are expected to grow and therefore equips domestic public health programs with key information needed regarding when to act and what to prioritize this same information is useful to health donors concentrated on efficiently disbursing resources for the largest health gain possible in the moment and when planning for the future this study has several limitations first although the world health surveys rely mostly on in person surveys which may reduce bias its anthropometric measures are self reported sensitivity analyses in fig c and tables h j and l in s1 appendix suggest that this does not represent a significant source of bias but ideally the outcome variable would be recorded anthropometrically in all instances by including mostly self reported data for high income countries we might observe lower bmi values in these countries but comparisons of self reported and national estimates suggest the bias averages to zero and an indicator variable for self reported data suggests it is only lower by 1 5 on average moreover our results remain similar using only the demographic and health surveys second all surveys in this analysis are cross sectional so we cannot follow individuals over time to observe their changing personal wealth and anthropometric measurements third there is a complex relationship between overweight obesity and personal wealth obesity may limit one s ability to attain wealth or it may be itself an indication of wealth depending on context fourth expected overweight and obesity projections are based on a relatively simple model and highlight how expected changes in wealth may translate to overweight and obesity rates given past trends and relationships continuing in the future some important determinants of overweight and obesity are not observed in our data reduced physical activity as a result of changes in occupation urbanization transportation or obesity status may be responsible for weight gain among many populations similarly we do not observe food prices and food availability at an individual level moreover these variables are not projected to 2040 and thus cannot be used for our projections for this reason we use data and parameter uncertainty to construct a possible range of projections based on past trends and relationships with gdp per capita as overweight and obesity continue to rise globally national policy makers may need to anticipate increased healthcare utilization by patients with overweight related comorbidities little attention to date has been spent on understanding effective interventions in lower middle and upper middle income countries in high income countries public health measures to reduce overweight and obesity such as food labelling in stores and restaurants media campaigns to change consumer behavior and restrictions on unhealthy food advertising have gained traction by 2040 we predict 70 2 64 1 76 4 of countries will begin or have undergone the wealth overweight transition by acting now national public health programs can better plan interventions to control overweight and obesity potentially reducing future disparities as well as avoiding future

this article appears in the november 29 2019 issue of executive intelligence review johanna clerc jozef miklo å ko dr mikloå ko is the former vice prime minister of post communist czechoslovakia before it divided into czechia and slovakia we present here an edited translation of his remarks presented on nov 17 2019 at the schiller institute conference â the future of humanity as a creative species in the universe â in bad soden germany subheads have been added thank youâ youâ re clapping and you donâ t even know what iâ m going to say it is too early thank you very much dear helga zepp larouche dear friends ladies and gentlemen it has already been said that i am slovak first a minute about our situation today it is exactly thirty years after our â velvet revolutionâ in the former czechoslovakia on november 17â our national holiday at that time a tranquil snow fell and released us from 40 years of dirty communism at that time marxism leninism disappeared from our history that was the best day in my life thatâ s why i have to speak at a party in bratislava this afternoon so i have to leave a little earlier we in slovakia have many problems like all states in europe but we are free that is very important we are free free people we can organize our lives according to our own ideas we can speak freely write publish do business travel i was president of the slovak christian seniors for twelve years three days ago i passed that on to someone else our pensioners have on average a 430 euro pension we do not complain we live and we are free larouche an american sakharov lyndon larouche was an american sakharov politician economist mathematician writer and musicologist he wrote dozens of books and thousands of articles he was a generator of new ideas a fighter for the salvation of christianity the family and life i met him 17 timesâ in america in germany three times in rome where i was an ambassador he said that the united states and europe lack vision itâ s not only about money and the economy but about spiritual and moral values in my book velmi prã sne tajnã â ako sme boli slobodnã very top secretâ as we were free 1999 i dedicated more than 90 pages with 20 photos to lyndon larouche and his institute which i later handed over to ms helga along with other materials i wrote about this great personality his views have triggered great criticism and slander especially in the united states and also in germany his movement was severely persecuted especially in america i recall october 6 1986 when the then government tried to shut down the movementâ s leesburg headquarters with 400 police officers and to arrest lyn this was followed by a political trial and absolutely unjustified punishment when we were beginning to carry out our biggest revolution against communism he was sentenced to 15 years on december 16 1989 and five of his colleagues were sentenced to a combined 209 years in prison mike billington was the record holder by the length of his sentence then there were so many irregularities in the trial of larouche and his colleagues at the end of the 1980s that the international community often protested that it was unfair and politically motivated i became acquainted with his case in 1990 when i served as vice prime minister of the government of czechoslovakia for human rights i wrote several letters of protest to the highest officials in america along with former politicians in several countries i am proud that i played a small role in the liberation of lyn in 1994 five years after his conviction and later for the rest of the â virginia five â i visited them all in prison and i wrote about it in this book in september of 1995 i attended a hearing in washington where the case was presented to an international tribunal of prominent judges and lawyers including ramsey clark former justice minister of the johnson administration the commission concluded that there had been a great deal of abuse in investigations and prosecution in this case which aimed at condemning and eliminating larouche and his movement when lyn celebrated his 75th birthday september 8 1997 we hosted a gala program with prominent singers musicians and politicians in washington thatâ s a little self praise but then i was the master of the ceremonies i have never seen such stars of the metropolitan opera in my life and together with them i sang glory glory hallelujah it was a fantastic concert and a fantastic time i have many photos of it my grandchildren always admire me i have 13 grandchildren and five great grandchildren and a wife with whom i have spent 55 years and as we celebrated that my wife said â thank you 55â but you have not been home for five years â excuse meâ that does not fit here laroucheâ s moral principles in economic development policy in the political program lyndon larouche did not mince words the economy should produce not speculate politics and the economy must be bound by moral principles he also came up with the idea of projects for the development of europe asia and africa debt relief for latin america and projects for the development of eastern europe his proposals for the reform of the financial system were an alternative he predicted the crisis especially the malignant effect of derivative speculation today you print fiat money in the u s and in europe this is now called â quantitative easing â thatâ s terrible they print and print and print helicopter money they spend 60 billion a month free of charge for the states of europe this reduces the interest and pumps the money into the bad old central bank system which saves the bad banks the financial system is separate from the productive economy when i left i phoned our first prime minister jan ä arnogurskã½ and told him that i was coming here and he said â say hello to helga and all the people who are thereâ â he is unfortunately in a different place todayâ â but tell them that all the prophecies of lyn for europe since 1986 have come true â the prime minister of slovakia said this and iâ m proud of it on the 30th of november we always have a meeting of czechs moravians and slovaks in brno in moravia all christian politicians of that time we will talk about it there as well six times i visited him and the other members of the movement in the american prisons in 1994 slovakia was the second country that lyn visited after his detention on his second visit to slovakia in 1996 he wrote slovakia is a happier country than others it has not lost the sense of spiritual values it has a national identity you need honest and determined leaders when i heard the crowd of 50 000 singing on the pilgrimage in nitra i understood that this is a good country everything is still like this we lack honest and determined leaders but hopefully they will come and i would like to say that there are 20 such pilgrimage sites in slovakia and in levoä a there were half a million slovaks itâ s a center in slovakia for these pilgrims let me now turn to lynâ s 1998 draft to overcome the crisis that is still interesting today really it still applies let me talk about his principles today is the time of a dangerous financial and economic emergency only preventive measures can prevent a collapse of civilization every nation must insist that there is no higher political authority than the sovereign nation state republic supranational institutions such as the international monetary fund have authority only as a forum for consultation between sovereign nation states each nation retains sovereignty over its financial monetary and economic affairs these are the principles during such a crisis no international loans should be issued state subsidized loans for infrastructure the productive sector agriculture world trade should be issued at an interest rate of no more than 1 to 2 per year the banks must cancel the derivatives as an accounting fraud no international authorities are necessary for the conclusion of international agreements the global economy is stifled by an overdose of supranational institutions lyn always proposed a new bretton woods deal that would establish fixed but adjustable exchange rates the ability to restrict convertibility if the national government considers it necessary as a layman i realize that it is immoral for someone to get as much money in a few days of speculation as other people get through hard work in their entire lives the collapse of the american hedge fund enron and many banks is just the tip of the iceberg now at the end of my speech there are some remarks from lyn which are not well known but as a christian i have mentioned this idea in my books and in my blog and i want to mention it here as well you may be a little surprised that lyn really said this he was a devout christian who spoke about his faith imago viva dei let me return to some of his ideas man is created in the image of god thus every individual has to be valued highly we must stop the killing of unborn children everything is decided in childhood children have to be educated to be creative today nobody has time for the children so television and the internet make them stupid i do not watch television but iâ m a bit addicted to the internet every day i post 10 to 20 statuses with video on facebookâ unfortunately but what should i do but if someoneâ s with friends tell them youâ re with the schiller institute then weâ ll talk about it i have also sent some news from this conference because if you are not on the internet then you do not exist pardon the world kills the souls of the children the preservation of the family must be protected the most important thing in education is the knowledge of classical music history and mathematics view full size pieter brueghel the elder some reminiscences have been published in slovakia by some of our priests and bishops with absolutely open and harsh criticism and i mean thatâ s very important that one talks like that because when the people who saw it die then in 100 years the story is very different for the last year or two iâ ve always said that you really have to tell the truth about history the truth frees us the best cultures in europeâ thatâ s another idea from lynâ the best cultures in europe came from christianity uneducated people know nothing about history culture science art only stupid people believe whatâ s in the newspaper and on television we have a lot of newspapers in slovakia but now the owners decide what to say thatâ s why you cannot read some of them itâ s all half lies and half truths then an alternative or the internet is very important of course there are many stupidities but there you have to choose and read different sources the ideology of hedonism is sick the free market rapes the weaker destroying agriculture industry and finance the third way in the economy is an economic policy based on christian principles money counterculture and unlimited freedom lead people into prison the compromise with evil and tolerance for evil must stop the comment on the lie is a lie as in mathematics if an axiom is not good then all the theories are bad a proposition is not truth let us begin a revolution in christian love as the good samaritan did then and the last from lyn itâ s a bit poetic what is the goal of man he comes into the world as an angel and he should leave it like an angel thatâ s what lyn said dear friends that is the end of my speech honor the memory of lyndon larouche he will always be in my heart and now i want to give these books to helga with a little comment this one is the book of 1999 ten years after the turn of 1989 there are 90 pages about lyn unfortunately it is only in slovak
damascus the syrian lira seems to be falling from one pitfall to another trading at almost 790 sp to the us dollar this has caused unprecedented havoc in syria as the population s already razor thin savings lose yet another chunk of their value after nearly nine years of war many analysts expect it to cross the 1 000 sp benchmark within the next few months although in september it stood at just above 600 sp to the us dollar this is the worst and quickest devaluation ever in the modern history of syria and it is largely linked to what is happening in neighbouring lebanon the lebanese banking system has historically been a safe haven for syrian businessmen who preferred depositing their savings into lebanese banks which were more secure and less regulated than those in syria now with dollars in scarcity in lebanon syrian businessmen have had their accounts locked in beirut preventing them from withdrawing more than 1 000 usd a week and with some commercial banks the limit is just 500 usd per week they still have the option of withdrawing their money in lebanese pounds whose value has dropped from 1 500 lp to the us dollar in mid october to 2 000 lb as of late november but even then they can only withdraw 1 million lebanese pounds per day if in person or 1 5 million through atms which are also short on money to move ahead with their imports and exports syrian business figures have turned to the local black market at home buying and transferring dollars abroad to keep up the trade at hugely inflated prices that was topped with lebanese citizens buying dollars from the syrian market to meet their needs also greatly affecting the exchange rate how bad is it very george saghir a new york based syrian economist told gulf news the situation is dire the dollars are gone they are now a very scarce commodity in lebanon the only solution for syria is to build firewalls around their remaining dollars like preventing their sale to lebanon from here on the syrian pound will mimic that of lebanon which continues to grow weaker what has the syrian government done about it for starters syrian authorities have started a clampdown on money exchangers throughout the country throwing many in jail that came a special fund to save the lira set up by leading syrian businessmen last september at a much publicized event at the sheraton hotel they donated money in us dollars to the syrian treasury which were automatically switched to syrian pounds to raise the local currency s value business magnet samer foz solely came up with 10 million usd but it had little or no influence at solving the problem despite the initiative the exchange rate continued to rise the syrian government then issued legislation raising the salary of state employees by 20 000 sp 25 usd and monthly pensions by 16 000 sp 20 usd hoping to accommodate the angry street they then banned the import of any foreign commodity that is paid for in us dollars unless there is no syrian made alternative on the market syrian importers could now no longer import chocolate alcohol designer brands or cosmetics from abroad such imports were always made through credit lines in us dollars devouring the country s reserve of foreign currency that too did little to solve the problem as businessmen turned to smuggling to meet their needs whether from lebanon or jordan and even turkey the price of foodstuff has increased dramatically higher than the actual depreciation of the syrian currency said amer elias a damascus based analyst that has led merchants to simply stop selling and manufacturers to stop producing unable to price their goods or determine their margin of profit due to the fluctuating market rates meanwhile the official rate at the central bank of syria still stands at a mythical 435 sp to the us dollar the government s complete silence over what s happening can only be described as a deficit he added to gulf news topped of course with a complete lack of vision but apart from the lebanon crisis the devaluation of the syrian pound has already been triggered by two other important developments government control of rebel areas one reason is the return of government control to former opposition areas in the syrian south and east ghouta said ebraheem hamidi senior diplomatic editor at the london based alsharq alawsat speaking to gulf news he explained those areas were a source of foreign currency income due to the steady financial support they were getting from the west suddenly that source of dollars dried up the government has restored control over most opposition held areas of the country image credit reuters those dollars had often found their way into government held areas always in abundance and their presence bolstered the syrian pound before government troops retook east aleppo for example back in december 2016 the exchange rate was 533 sp to the us dollar after the armed opposition were evacuated to idlib in the syrian northwest the exchange rate first hit the 600 sp benchmark but it was quickly reduced by government authorities who drowned the market with local currency to raise its value fear in the business community the second reason seems to be the amount of unsolicited rumors that ripped through damascus since early september about big business names and warlords earmarked for termination in what is being peddled by the government as an anti corruption campaign first on the target list was rami makhhlouf the president s cousin making many smaller businessmen and profiteers feel unsafe those rumors were never backed by a coherent statement from syrian authorities causing many to panic fearing that their property would be confiscated or that their bank accounts seized an unknown number of businessmen rapidly converted their syrian savings into us dollars seemingly in very large quantities greatly damaging the value of the syrian pound

by carol chan hong kong nov 27 ifr the people s republic of china rated a1 a a made a swift return to the international market yesterday with its largest single foreign currency sovereign bond issue a us 6bn four trancher that drew final orders of more than us 16 5bn the reg s unrated issue comes after china issued its first euro sovereign bond in 15 years with a 4bn us 4 4bn triple tranche deal earlier this month that set the previous record the reg s offering is also the largest by an asian sovereign issuer and benefits china s sovereign dollar curve by expanding the tenor variety while also potentially pushing down the funding costs of chinese issuers given the tight pricing acting through the ministry of finance the sovereign priced a us 1 5bn 1 875 three year a us 2bn 1 95 five year a us 2bn 2 125 10 year and a us 500m 2 75 20 year at 35bp 40bp 50bp and 70bp wide of treasuries respectively the four tranches were priced at 99 843 99 782 98 993 and 98 019 giving reoffer yields of 1 929 1 996 2 238 and 2 881 respectively the spreads were 25bp 25bp 20bp and 10bp tighter compared with the respective initial guidance of 60bp area 65bp area 70bp area and 80bp area over treasuries all tranches bar the 20 year were priced tighter than creditsights fair value estimation creditsights yesterday saw fair value for the four tranches at treasuries plus 43bp 48bp 62bp and 50bp respectively after adding 2bp premium as extra juice for the unrated and potentially large size to entice investors for the five and 10 year tranches tight pricing sam fischer head of china onshore debt capital markets at deutsche bank said the transaction priced within the mof s secondary curve across different tranches and attracted a number of key sovereign and real money investors china mof has further built up its usd curve with this jumbo deal following the very successful eur trade earlier this month mof is effectively building up a solid track record as regular issuer in the international market he said the three year and five year priced 8bp and 5bp respectively inside china s dollar sovereign curve and fair value estimation by the leads according to a banker on the deal the 10 year priced flat to the curve while the pricing of the 20 year was about flat or even inside depending on which fair value estimate people used there was no consensus on the fair value for the 20 year given that sovereign references for that tenor are rare it was a price discovery process the banker explained we have used china s 20 year euro bond after swapping into us dollars as well as china s 30 year dollar curve minus 15bp to come up with the fair value estimation giving 2 75 and 2 9 respectively the final pricing using the reoffer yield of 2 881 was inside the range the banker said china had achieved pricing almost flat to some developed markets such as japan with the latest deal japan bank for international cooperation s 1 625 2022s bonds which has a guarantee from the japanese government was bid at 1 929 at the time the mof priced its four tranche deal the same of the reoffer yield of china s three year tranche japan is rated a1 a a sean mcnelis co head of dcm asia pacific at hsbc said the mof raised a striking us 10bn equivalent in november with a mix of short and long dated tranches in both the euro and dollar markets amid global uncertainty which will provide a range of useful benchmarks for chinese entities looking to access global debt markets in the months ahead in addition the mof on wednesday reopened two tranches of its offshore renminbi bonds in hong kong for a tap of rmb5bn us 710m via a tender bringing this year s total issuance of the dim sum bonds in hong kong to rmb15bn the magnitude and frequency of these visits to the international market this year underscore the mof s aim to build liquid yield sovereign curves in the international market and to increase the understanding of the credit among global investors china has been expanding its footprint in international bond markets it ended a decade long absence from the us dollar market in october 2017 when it printed us 2bn of sovereign bonds to overwhelming demand it returned in october last year for a further us 3bn again attracting strong demand despite aglobal marketsell off during bookbuilding in its two previous dollar issues it sold bonds with tenors of five 10 and 30 years liquidity was low for the two previous issues as trading slowed quickly around one month following the issuances as investors just hold the bonds with the bigger size of each tranche this time liquidity should improve another banker on the deal said curve completion creditsights said the new 20 year note will fill a void in china s sovereign yield curve between the 10 year and 30 year bonds issued in 2018 while the other tranches will help to further populate the curve and provide more precise pricing overall this will make for a more complete sovereign dollar yield curve and could help lower funding costs for quasi sovereigns commercial banks and corporates in the dollar bond market if the new sovereign bonds are priced as tightly as expected said creditsights while the bonds drew strong demand the oversubscription was lower than on the mof s two previous dollar issues final orders were over us 21bn or 10 5 times covered for the us 2bn issue in 2017 and us 13 2bn or 4 4 times for the us 3bn issue in 2018 compared with only 2 75 times for the latest offering market participants said this was mainly because of the jumbo size tight pricing and timing a portfolio manager from a hong kong based insurance company said he did not participate because of the tight pricing the spread is not attractive and there is not much room for secondary performance he said china us trade talks remain an uncertainty and as it is towards the end of the year i think investors will be more conservative on investment final orders for the three year tranche were over us 4 6bn from 93 accounts including us 1 79bn from the leads asia took 62 of the bonds emea 33 and offshore us and the americas 5 by investor type 46 went to banks 41 to the public sector 7 to fund managers

a study published this week in the journal of the american medical association jama details the fall in life expectancy in the united states from 2015 to 2017 a streak unprecedented in modern times virginia commonwealth university professor dr steven h woolf and eastern virginia medical school student heidi schoomaker analyzed life expectancy data for the years 1959 2016 and cause specific mortality rates for 1999 2017 the data shows that the decline in life expectancy is not a statistical anomaly but the outcome of a decades long assault on the working class the report exposes a country in the grips of a profound social crisis the record stock prices touted by trump are in fact a measure of the increased economic exploitation that has produced the fall in life expectancy among workers protesters assemble a makeshift memorial to those lost to drug overdoses last year during a demonstration in support of a proposed supervised injection site outside the federal courthouse in philadelphia in september the shuttering of thousands of factories and mines countless store closures and downsizings along with the slashing of wages pensions and health care benefits to meet the demands of wall street investors have literally killed hundreds of thousands of workers across the united states life expectancy increased annually from 1959 until it stopped rising in 2010 plateauing at zero growth before beginning its descent after 2014 when it peaked at 78 9 years by 2017 life expectancy had fallen to 78 6 years not coincidentally 2010 was also the year that obamacare was signed into law an attack on health care sold as a progressive reform the decline in life expectancy since then exposes obamacare s regressive character only one of the reactionary legacies of the obama administration obamacare was part of a deliberate drive by the ruling class to lower the life expectancy of working people as far as the strategists of american capitalism are concerned the longer the lifespan of elderly and retired workers who no longer produce profits for the corporations but require government subsidized medical care to deal with health issues the greater the sums that are diverted from the coffers of the rich and the military machine a 2013 paper by anthony h cordesman of the washington think tank center for strategic and international studies csis frankly presented the increasing longevity of ordinary americans as an immense crisis for us imperialism the us does not face any foreign threat as serious as its failure to come to grips with the rise in the cost of federal entitlement spending cordesman wrote saying the debt crisis was driven almost exclusively by the rise in federal spending on major health care programs social security and the cost of net interest on the debt meanwhile conditions for the rich have never been better this is reflected in the growing life expectancy gap between the rich and the poor the richest one percent of men live 14 years longer than the poorest one percent and the richest one percent of women 10 years longer than the poorest despite expending far more per capita on health care than other major capitalist countries the united states has fallen far behind when it comes to life expectancy and mortality the us began to lose pace with other developed countries beginning in the 1980s and by 1998 had fallen below the average for countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development the first nodal point in the early 1980s corresponds to the initiation of the social counterrevolution by the administration of ronald reagan which involved union busting strikebreaking wage cutting and plant closings on a nationwide scale combined with cuts in education health care and other social programs this was launched with the breaking of the patco air traffic controllers strike in 1981 carried out with the complicity of the afl cio reagan s social policies were rapidly adopted by the democrats and continued by the clinton and obama administrations the second major inflection point was the wall street crash of 2008 which was followed by trillions in bailouts for the banks on the one hand and brutal austerity against the working class on the other the ensuing decade has seen the explosion of the opioid crisis which has ravaged communities across the united states according to the jama report the decrease in life expectancy is the outcome of nearly three decades of increasing mortality among midlife working age adults those 25 64 this is mainly the result of a dramatic rise in drug overdoses alcohol abuse suicide and a series of organ system diseases between 1999 and 2017 drug overdose mortality among those in their prime working years increased an astounding 386 5 percent going from 6 7 deaths to 32 5 deaths per 100 000 the increase in mortality was greatest for the youngest of this cohort between the ages of 25 and 34 rising 531 4 percent the report found that between 2010 and 2017 the overall midlife mortality rate increased from 328 5 to 348 2 per 100 000 resulting in 33 307 deaths that would not have occurred if the rate had held steady the rise in mortality has impacted workers across every racial and ethnic group with the largest number of excess deaths occurring among white workers a grim refutation of the concept of white privilege by means of such racialist conceptions the ruling class seeks to promote racial and national divisions even as the reality of social life confirms the fundamental identity of interests of workers of all races and nationalities woolf and schoomaker found that the largest relative increase in midlife mortality was concentrated in new england and the ohio valley two areas that have been hit particularly hard by deindustrialization and the opioid crisis approximately one third of the excess deaths since 2010 occurred in just four states ohio pennsylvania indiana and kentucky eight of the top 10 states for excess deaths are in the midwest and appalachia what s not lost on us is what is going on in those states dr woolf told the new york times the history of when this health trend started happens to coincide with when these economic shifts began the loss of manufacturing jobs and closure of steel mills and auto plants this jama analysis exposes the commission of a crime on an immense scale when society places hundreds of proletarians in such a position that they inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death friedrich engels wrote in 1845 in the condition of the working class in england yet permits these conditions to remain its deed is murder just as surely as the deed of the single individual the responsibility for driving workers to an early grave lies with the capitalist system s insatiable demand for ever greater profits the key accomplices in this crime have been the unions which serve as the corporations industrial police force on the shop floor ensuring the orderly closure of plants and imposing one concessions contract after another in this mad drive for profits workers are being squeezed past the breaking point the amazonification of work and the growth of the gig economy in the last decade have dramatically increased the exploitation of the working class workers are driven to powerful painkillers including oxycontin and opioids simply to cope with the injuries and illnesses that result from overwork the reemergence of the class struggle across the us and internationally has shown the way forward however while tens of thousands of auto workers teachers and other workers have taken strike action in the last year their struggles have been betrayed by the unions what is required to meet the needs of the working class is a

china represents an existential threat to the national security of the us in terms of growth of military capabilities but more importantly in the economic realm as they pursue their made in china 2025 and belt road initiatives advertisement the purpose of this thread series is to present the contents of one of those reports in bite sized chunks that are more easily digestible in order to convey a better understanding of the chinese economy and its long term challenges to the us and the world part i introduced and summarized the congressional research service report china s economic rise history trends challenges and implications for the united states which forms the basis for this series so far we have covered the report s summary a history of china s economic development since 1979 the two main factors contributing to their development over the years measuring the size of china s economy china s role as the world s largest manufacturer and changes in china s wage and labor cost advantages parts i ii iii and iv can be found here here here and here this part covers foreign direct investment in china and the factors driving the outflow of foreign direct investment from china china s trade and investment reforms and incentives led to a surge in fdi beginning in the early 1990s such flows have been a major source of china s productivity gains and rapid economic and trade growth there were reportedly 445 244 foreign invested enterprises fies registered in china in 2010 employing 55 2 million workers or 15 9 of the urban workforce as indicated in the figure below industrial output by foreign invested firms in china as a share of national output total 1990 2011 fies account for a significant share of china s industrial output advertisement that level rose from 2 3 in 1990 to a high of 35 9 in 2003 but fell to 25 9 in 2011 28 in addition fies are responsible for a significant level of china s foreign trade at their peak fies accounted for 58 3 of chinese exports in 2005 and 59 7 of imports but these levels have subsequently fallen reaching 41 7 and 43 7 respectively in 2018 refer to the figure below share of chinese merchandise exports and imports by foreign invested enterprises in china 1990 2018 the un conference on trade and development unctad reports that china has become a both a major recipient of global fdi as well as a major provider of fdi outflows refer to the figure below estimates of china s annual fdi inflows and outflows 2005 2018 china s fdi inflows in 2018 were 139 billion making it the world s second largest recipient of fdi after the united states china s fdi outflows have grew rapidly after 2005 and exceeded fdi inflows for the first time in 2015 china s fdi outflows reached a historic peak of 196 1 billion in 2016 but declined in 2017 and 2018 reflecting a crackdown by the chinese government on investment deemed wasteful and well as greater scrutiny by foreign governments of china s efforts to obtain advanced technology firms and other strategic assets still china was the world s second largest source of fdi outflows after japan the sharp increase in china s global fdi outflows in recent years appears to be largely driven by a number of factors including chinese government policies and initiatives to encourage firms to go global the government wants to use fdi to gain access to ipr technology know how famous brands etc in order to move chinese firms up the value added chain in manufacturing and services boost domestic innovation and development of chinese brands and help chinese firms especially soes to become major global competitors advertisement china s slowing economy and rising labor costs have also encouraged greater chinese overseas fdi in order to help firms diversify risk and expand business opportunities beyond the china market and in some cases to relocate less competitive firms from china to low cost countries china s ministry of foreign trade mofcom reports that in 2018 chinese nonfinancial fdi in bri countries totaled 15 6 billion up 8 9 over the previous year additionally increased fdi outflows may be the result of the chinese government attempting to diversify its foreign exchange reserve holdings which totaled 3 1 trillion as of april 2019 by far the world s largest holder the largest foreign investors in china based on fdi stock through 2017 were hong kong 52 6 of total the british virgin islands 10 6 japan 6 1 singapore 4 0 and germany 3 2 refer to the table below chinese data on top ten sources of china s fdi inflows to china 1979 2017 a key aspect of china s economic modernization and growth strategy during the 1980s and 1990s was to attract fdi into china to help boost the development of domestic firms investment by chinese firms abroad was sharply restricted however in 2000 china s leaders initiated a new go global strategy which sought to encourage chinese firms primarily soes to invest overseas one key factor driving this investment is china s massive accumulation of foreign exchange reserves traditionally a significant level of those reserves has been invested in relatively safe but low yielding assets such as u s treasury securities advertisement on september 29 2007 the chinese government officially launched the china investment corporation cic in an effort to seek more profitable returns on its foreign exchange reserves and diversify away from its u s dollar holdings the cic was originally funded at 200 billion making it one of the world s largest sovereign wealth funds another factor behind the government s drive to encourage more outward fdi flows has been to obtain natural resources such as oil and minerals deemed by the government as necessary to sustain china s rapid economic growth finally the chinese government has indicated its goal of developing globally competitive chinese firms with their own brands investing in foreign firms or acquiring them is viewed as a method for chinese firms to obtain technology management skills and often internationally recognized brands needed to help chinese firms become more globally competitive for example in april 2005 lenovo group limited a chinese computer company purchased ibm corporation s personal computer division for 1 75 billion the largest destinations of cumulative chinese fdi outflows through 2017 were hong kong 54 2 of total the cayman islands 13 9 the british virgin islands 6 7 and the united states 3 7 refer to the table below major destinations of chinese nonfinancial fdi outflows by stock through 2017 a significant level of chinese fdi that goes to hong kong the british virgin islands and the cayman islands likely is redirected elsewhere the american enterprise institute aei maintain the china global investment tracker cgit a database that has been developed to track the actual flows from the parent company to the final destination of chinese investment globally the cgit database tracks fdi valued at 100 million or more which it refers to as china s outward non bond investment these data differ significantly from official chinese fdi outflow data the cgit data on the top destinations of total chinese outward non bond outward investment from 2005 to 2017 included the united states 172 7 billion australia 103 7 billion the united kingdom 75 billion brazil 61 2 billion and russia 53 8 refer to the figure below aei estimates of chinese cumulative outward investment by major destination 2005 2017 advertisement it should be noted the chinese direct foreign investment is impacted greatly by the ongoing trade war with the us chinese banks are teetering due to lack of foreign currency and beijing must reduce overseas investments accordingly putting a crimp in their belt road initiative resetting trade with the us is painful for beijing and president trump is using america s economic leverage wisely in that regard going forward look for the chinese to squeeze countries in which they ve made those investments to get them to pay back their loans too even the chinese themselves are projecting their 2020 growth at 5 8 one of the lowest growth rates in decades and probably over estimated like usual as noted by the national institution for finance and development nifd in this article keep the pressure on mr president this part ends here the next part will cover china s merchandise trade patterns including major trading partners and major chinese trading commodities the end

there is currently a relative attractiveness to the mexican market with investors starting to anticipate that a period of positive economic growth in developed markets may be coming to an end mexico s new administration promised to transform the country for the better since andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo took office in december 2018 though he has made several decisions that have caused turbulence within the economy while amlo ensured mexico was the first country to sign the united states mexico canada agreement he also abruptly cancelled the construction of a new airport in mexico city moreover the unpredictability of his policies has seen credit rating agencies issue warnings to the country under amlo s presidency both sovereign bonds and the debt held by state owned oil and electric companies have experienced downgrades the finance minister s sudden resignation in july also pointed towards internal disagreements within the government and sent the mexican peso tumbling clearly if any investor had foreseen these events at the beginning of 2019 they would have immediately sold their mexican assets in anticipation of continued uncertainty in the country s macroeconomic environment however this has not transpired in fact almost all major financial assets in mexico have generated competitive returns when compared with other emerging markets at sura investment management we think we can explain this oddity almost all major financial assets in mexico have generated competitive returns when compared with other emerging markets bucking the trend sura is dedicated to the administration of assets and investments for global institutional customers our knowledge and extended presence in six latin american countries makes us an optimal investment vehicle connecting the region with global markets overall we manage more than 400 portfolios invested across fixed income equity multi asset and alternative assets among our most relevant products are mutual funds pension funds and corporate mandates what s more our parent firm sura asset management is the region s number one pension provider in terms of assets under management we believe the answer to mexico s high returns lies in global growth and the monetary policies of the world s central banks there is currently a relative attractiveness to the mexican market with investors starting to anticipate that a period of positive economic growth in developed markets may be coming to an end central banks around the world have raised concerns about low economic growth and have changed their monetary policy stance accordingly by slashing interest rates this trend has boosted liquidity and triggered a search for yields around financial markets with investors turning to countries that boast stable macroeconomic conditions and allocating assets to those with positive real rates and undervalued equity markets one such market is mexico which offers potentially high returns in its local fixed income and equity markets according to sura data the country ranks among the top five emerging markets when it comes to risk adjusted real interest rates so it is unsurprising that the mexican stock market appears more attractive to investors in real terms than other major equity markets remain vigilant at sura we expect the mexican economy to continue along a moderate growth path but this is by no means guaranteed a global economic slowdown combined with unwise political decisions could hinder the deployment of much needed economic resources negatively affecting consumer demand and jeopardising investor confidence although there is yet to be any clear evidence to suggest that the current macroeconomic environment is unfavourable mexico must be careful to keep the economy stable and its conditions attractive to foreign investors in order to do this financial discipline is of paramount importance the government must strive to achieve a primary surplus and keep debt under control it must also try to stabilise the financial situation of pemex the nation s heavily indebted oil company if the mexican government is able to maintain macroeconomic stability even when pursuing unorthodox policies then mexico s financial assets should continue to outperform those of its peers particularly as some fundamental risks are still present within the mexican fixed income and equity markets assuming this is the case the potential yield compression in local currency mexican bonds will remain attractive while returns in the equity market should improve finally due to a combination of global liquidity a result of dovish central banks and the relative attractiveness of the mexican market positive trade is likely to continue until there is strong evidence to suggest the macroeconomic environment is deteriorating the lack of any fundamental threat will boost mexican financial assets normalising the extra risk premium that prevails in several financial instruments this should enable the country to rapidly catch up with the strong performance of its fellow emerging markets

uncertainty as a result of the unresolved trade conflict between the usa and china internationally experts expect the growth to continue albeit there may be differences between regions after years of crisis in the oil and gas industry there is an increasing awareness of the need for spending to avoid supply bottlenecks in the medium term provided that the development of the global economy is reasonably sound in north america by contrast it is becoming apparent that declining spending coupled with an above average natural depletion rate will lead to a significant slowdown in production growth this should have a positive effect on the oil price in the medium term and thus on spending in this sector we see a positive effect in our order books due to international spending for exploration and production of oil and gas there is still a lot of catching up to do and that will increase as demand is growing if the economy continues to be buoyant spending behavior should be further stimulated says ceo gerald grohmann the development of efficient high quality products is an integral part of our sustainable growth strategy this will help us to strengthen our positioning in

port of spain trinidad finance minister colm imbert said last monday that the trinidad and tobago government was being urged to adopt a structural adjustment programme more than two decades after the oil rich twin island republic ended a similar programme with the washington based international monetary fund imf indeed 25 years after we got ourselves out of an imf programme we were advised to embrace the same old sterile measures from 1990 focused on contraction without due consideration of the short and long term adverse effects on our citizens imbert told a development bank of latin america caf seminar imbert speaking on the theme restructuring a commodity dependent economy for growth without external intervention said that the adverse effects of the imf s structural adjustment programme created the necessity for a wide ranging programme of economic and financial reform in trinidad and tobago the finance minister said that by 1991 the economy began to respond to the stabilisation measures and to show signs of a recovery for the next 10 years from 1991 to 2001 there was slow growth followed by a tripling of our gdp gross domestic product between 2001 and 2008 as both our energy and non energy sectors took off as commodity prices skyrocketed but imbert said that in 2015 when the present keith rowley came to power oil prices were again dropping like a stone gas production was on the decline and gas prices were depressed sending our economy into turmoil imbert said that over the years several missions from the imf had conducted their own in depth review of the local economy whose reports were shared with major stakeholder groups the finance minister said that the country also benefitted from a visit by an imf technical team that came here soon after 2015 and that many of the proposals from the various interest groups organisations and experts had a common theme including implementing a property tax system expanding the tax base increasing tax collection as well as increasing personal income tax and corporate tax but he said that trinidad and tobago would not implement the measures as had been recommended by the imf we had had enough of that we chose a different path we immediately embarked on reducing government expenditure to what we felt were manageable levels from tt 63 billion to tt 52 billion in the first year and eventually down to 50 billion by 2018 it may sound facetious but we were able to do this by cutting out waste mismanagement and inflated costs also known as corruption imbert said they also looked at the things that were bleeding the treasury including the national oil company and the airline we found our national oil company to be losing on average us 300 million a year and our national airline having lost a total of us 500 million over a five year period he noted we thus set about to address these chronic money losers lest they crippled our economy imbert told the conference saying that going forward our national development agenda will build on our achievements as we continue to take the necessary measures to avoid a debt trap and external intervention

dealer with more than 1 000 safe deposit boxes for rent in central zurich it had scores of empty boxes three years ago but now it s renting about five a day said benoit schoeni a managing director there has been an extreme demand he said it won t take too long until we re full up safe deposit boxes can range from a few centimeters in height to the size of a kitchen cabinet another option are free ports warehouses in tax free zones such as singapore geneva and delaware favored for storing art but which typically limit the amount of time that pieces can be held there are more than 25 million safe deposit boxes by some estimates in the u s alone they can be used for the mundane to the exotic a private collector held the crown of the andes made with 5 3 pounds of gold and more than 400 emeralds in a citibank box before its sale four years ago to the metropolitan museum of art still for many banks they re no longer a core offering the amount of space they require is one deterrent that s especially the case in london home to the world s largest population of wealthy individuals according to real estate broker knight frank in the city center few places have secure storage facilities as large as ibv s on park lane where customers can also purchase gold coins from across the globe in the u s safe deposit boxes also have largely fallen out of favor as banks close branches and opt not to install them in new ones demand has waned in recent years according to jpmorgan chase co and bank of america corp the nation s two largest lenders much of the decline can be attributed to clients opting to store documents online especially younger clients said bank of america spokesman don vecchiarello but there s revived interest as fears of weather disasters and wildfires have prompted more people to secure their valuables said jerry pluard founder of safe deposit box insurance coverage the boxes are also an option for cannabis businesses that are locked out of the u s banking system because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level he said some swiss firms are also seeing demand driven by central bank policy negative interest rates have left switzerland s banks caught between the prospect of losing money to hold client deposits and imposing fees that could chase customers away ubs group ag the world s biggest wealth manager and rival credit suisse group ag announced plans this year to expand measures for charging rich clients for holding excess cash to some these extra costs have made the safe deposit box a viable alternative a spokeswoman for ubs s switzerland bank which operates almost 250 000 safe deposit boxes nationwide said demand from clients has declined in recent years the storage cost for cash is cheaper than negative interest rates said swiss gold safe s karl the firm offers six box sizes with the largest renting for 4 039 swiss francs 4 079 a year cash storage has become a strong business for us some bankers said the desire for safe deposit boxes makes little sense to avoid charges on their accounts the wealthy can spread their cash across multiple banks clients also need to buy insurance in case something happens to the money such as a fire safe deposit box firms sometimes subsidize that extra cost with ibv london offering 100 000 pounds of complimentary insurance for each hired container the proliferation of nonbanks providing safe deposit boxes has prompted some swiss lawmakers to question whether they re providing a safe haven for wrongdoing such as money laundering noting they don t face the same level of scrutiny and regulatory oversight as traditional banks storing large sums of cash in safe deposit boxes demands a checklist of tasks those include arranging transport of the money and keeping detailed records of its location to avoid raising suspicions over money laundering if the cash ever returns to a bank account moreover failing to strictly adhere to a safe deposit firm s protocols may result in being rejected as a customer the even bigger issue is getting the cash back into your account said felix brill chief investment officer of liechtenstein based vp bank which manages about 50 billion of assets and offers some safe deposit boxes still no one likes to pay negative interest rates everyone looks for alternatives safe deposit boxes aren t always a fail safe in 2015 burglars drilled through the wall of an underground vault in london s hatton garden diamond district making off with 20 million of jewelry a year earlier a customer of a wells fargo co branch in highland park new jersey lost millions of dollars of rare watches that had been stored in a safe deposit box the new york times reported in july ironically heists and scandals can boost other firms offering safe deposit boxes as the rich hunt even more secure places to stash their prized possessions christopher barrow chief executive officer of london based metropolitan safe deposits said his company spent more than 3 million to build a facility that opened this year in southwest london hatton garden was a classic case said barrow whose firm has more than 15 000 safe deposit boxes in central london

the bicycle theory used to be a metaphor for international trade policy just as standing still on a bicycle is not an option one must keep moving forward or else fall over so it was said that trade negotiators must engage in successive rounds of liberalisation otherwise global openness would gradually succumb to protectionist interests i don t know whether the theory was right in fact had governments stood still on trade policy over the last three years the world would be a lot better off than it is now trade is faltering global volumes are down a remarkable 1 1 over the last 12 months as inept bikers collide chaotically with one another once competent riders are again in charge they could do worse than return to the post second world war formula of negotiating the reciprocal elimination of tariffs the suggestion sounds old fashioned after all another familiar truism is that shallow integration removing obvious trade barriers such as tariffs and quotas is largely complete and that further progress now requires deep integration or mutually agreed rules for regulating the business environment but that agenda despite its potential merits now appears too ambitious a classic example of deep integration was the decision by the member states of the european common market to go beyond free trade and pursue a full european union and even a common currency that was evidently an overreach politically at least for the brexit plagued uk a current attempt at deep integration is the us government s demand that china stop requiring american companies to share their proprietary technology as a condition for entering joint ventures with local firms many american economists support this demand but argue that the us president donald trump has gone about it all wrong the sensible strategy would have been for the us to make common cause with other major governments to put pressure on china preferably via multilateral institutions such as the world trade organization german carmakers of course have as much at stake in china as american firms do yet even a future us president who took a better approach probably would not succeed for one thing regulating technology transfer would be very tricky in the best of worlds typically there is no explicit quid pro quo initiated by the chinese firm much less by the chinese government often the foreign corporation is the one that offers to share technology to make itself attractive to a local firm as a joint venture partner how could a government regulate such a subtle process the answer may be for the chinese government to eliminate the requirement that foreign firms doing business in china must have a local partner in fact the authorities have recently taken steps in this direction in the financial and automotive sectors simpler yet would have been for china to remove its long standing tariffs on automobile imports so that us and german carmakers could have exported directly to the chinese market as an alternative to setting up production facilities there not only would this outcome have been simpler it also would have benefited american and german workers directly so let s go back to good old tariff negotiations the us should remove all the tariffs it has imposed over the last few years on washing machines solar panels steel aluminum automobiles and myriad other products in return china should of course rescind its own retaliatory measures for example against us exports of soybeans pork and other farm products turning the clock back to january 2017 would be a big improvement but we should not stop there the earlier conventional wisdom always overestimated the extent of shallow integration governments should move toward free trade in motor vehicles and as many other sectors as possible a sector especially suited for liberalisation is solar panels turbines and other renewable energy inputs ironically many governments that purport to care about the environment maintain trade barriers that increase the cost of protecting it the eu china and the us are leading offenders a damaging trump policy that will need to be reversed is his abuse of the national security exception to justify protectionist trade measures the international trade system had previously allowed each government to interpret this exception as they saw fit most applied it judiciously knowing that abuse would encourage others to behave similarly but under trump any sector of the economy from automobiles to peanut butter apparently qualifies as essential to national security new international negotiations should clarify exactly what qualifies sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk none of this addresses the problem that trade creates losers as well as winners something that we all supposedly had forgotten until we needed to explain how trump won the 2016 us presidential election let s hope that now three years later we have learned that tariffs also create losers as well as winners and many more of the former in the case of trump s trade war get tough trade policies are not a solution to the problem of inequality moreover trade is only one of many factors that contribute to inequality and regardless of the relative importance of each cause the list of practical remedies is pretty much the same in the us it includes expansion of health insurance pre school for all children infrastructure investment competition policy a restoration of post 2008 financial regulations and more progressive taxation some say that the us should raise trade barriers until it is ready to enact such policies but that is a non sequitur we should implement as many of these share the gains measures as we can while also ending the trade war and in the future we free traders may need to be satisfied with an agenda of eliminating tariffs and quotas deep integration it turns out is perhaps a bridge too far
