dr masahiro matsumura in the turbulent world politics involving extensive international coverage stable and humdrum japan does not have much of a presence yet japan is the world s largest creditor nation while continuously playing significant roles in trade direct investment and economic assistance japan in the background has reinforced itself as a leading geo economic power while having almost thoroughly eliminated its huge non performing loans in the banking sector and other structural vulnerabilities over the so called lost two decades consequent on its bubble burst in the early 1990s let us examine it by deploying the famous 5 es of prof djawed sangdel emphasizing japan s world largest public debts that amount to nearly 240 of its gdp is misleading given that its public assets amount to nearly 200 and that the holding of the government bonds by the bank of japan practically a part of the government amount to more than 80 this is consistent with the good stability of a strong yen and very low long term prime rates on the other hand the u s faces deepening structural vulnerabilities in stocks that have resulted from the bankruptcy of lehman brothers in 2008 and the ensuing financial crisis while experiencing a transitory booming in flows also the e u remains mired not only in serious structural vulnerabilities but also in a persistent recession consequently both the u s and the e u have a significantly less free hand in foreign economic policy while keeping themselves busy to obtain or retain comparative gains through their strategic interaction most notably in trade with the quantitative tightening of the u s the e u and finally the japanese central banks brics and other major developing economies encounter increasing difficulties in financing for investment and growth compounded by the shrinking of their u s and european export outlets particularly the chinese yuan is effectively pegged with the u s dollar while china s money supply in yuan is in fact based on its dollar reserves consequently china is sliding into a serious recession aggravated by the intense trade war with the u s no wonder that last october china made an abrupt about face on its persistent anti japan policy and concluded the currency swap agreement with japan that would surely furnish china with 3 trillion japanese yen or less than 270 billion u s dollars in the event of an acute liquidity crisis looking closely at the recent japan china interaction japan s quiet rise is more conspicuous for several years prior to the official reconciliation of october 2018 the two countries appeared to geo economically compete head to head centered on aid and development according to china s one belt one road strategy and japan s counter strategy or free and open indo pacific strategy china is undergoing serious setbacks because many recipient investee states have cancelled cut down or postponed china sponsored development projects these states have suffered china s debt trap and many of the projects have turned out be financially environmentally and socially unsustainable china is increasingly constrained to finance development projects due to the hardly discernible yet significant dwindling of its dollar reserves that is statistically covered up by its foreign borrowings certainly china has succeeded in luring more than ninety developing and developed countries with its huge fabricated foreign reserves as show money to participate in the china led asian infrastructure investment bank but the country has failed to secure the aiib memberships of japan and the united states respectively the world s largest credit nation and the key currency nation with most developed financial and bonds markets without sufficient funds and staffs the aiib cannot but co finance projects with the world bank and the asian development bank to obtain a favorable credit rating necessary for financing though international financial markets in contrast japan has demanded china to observe international standards in aid and development and only agreed in october 2018 to selectively coordinate its policy with china only when the country meets these stringent conditions there has been no major successful coordination case between the two to date given that many of traditional japanese aid recipients are no longer low income countries the japanese approach will necessarily focus more on high quality aid and development in terms of sustainability through the public private sector cooperation the approach will be superior to china s at least over a medium to long run additionally japan plays a leading role to preserve the existing free and open international economic system against the tide of populism and protectionism most notably u s president donald trump s america first japan successfully led the formation of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership after the u s made an abrupt exit from an early tpp in the making and concluded the japan eu economic partnership agreement in nutshell japan s geo economic power and influence will be outstanding at least for a mid term yet the country is not free from serious risks and problems for a short term japan s rise will remain quiet and perhaps unnoticeable especially because its geo economic power and influence may be reduced by geo political risks and crises and because its vested bureaucratic interests hamper consolidation of its huge public debts and assets which involves the great risk of a liquidity crisis for a long term japan needs to find out a societal equation to cope with an unprecedented low birthrate and a high longevity rate the world must stay tuned on humdrum japan dr masahiro matsumura is professor of international politics and national security faculty of law of the st andrew s university momoyama gakuin daigaku in osaka japan
euromoney s first quarterly risk survey of the year reveals a balanced global profile with 57 countries becoming riskier having lower risk scores and the same number that are now safer with higher scores for many countries economic growth is creating jobs lowering welfare bills and eroding debt to gdp ratios while the return to more normal commodity price patterns coupled with the prospect of economic activity improving in the second half of the year has seen asset prices stabilizing after severe volatility in autumn yet the global kaleidoscope of risk is constantly shifting with north america more of a concern now that the shine has been taken off the economic outlook by us monetary policy tightening and protectionist policies trump s threats to close the mexican border and the delays sparked by the deployment of border officials to deal with central american migrants are adversely affecting trade flows the us remains the 16th safest country worldwide according to euromoney s global risk rankings but its risk score has dived this quarter despite reaching a new us mexico canada trade agreement that will modernize the existing north american free trade agreement
heading into 2020 liberals are at a crossroads on trade most abhor donald trump s america first rhetoric and even as they increasingly recognize that something is amiss with the global system many are frightened by his bull in a china shop approach but just what is the big competing vision his opponents have to offer for decades the political and intellectual leaders of the democratic party marched alongside the gop under the banner of free trade organized labor often objected to the resulting loss of manufacturing jobs as corporations moved factories offshore or simply surrendered markets to foreign rivals so did some democratic politicians after all dick gephardt s slogan in his failed bid to win the 1988 democratic presidential nomination was let s make america first again but union grievances tended to be dismissed as the plaints of workers unwilling or unable to compete in a global economy all thinking people at least in the party s expanding wing of college educated professionals knew that free trade promoted international peace and prosperity and anything less was special interest politics this idea became particularly pervasive in the early 1990s when president bill clinton embraced the north american free trade agreement nafta the trade pact was originally proposed by ronald reagan and largely negotiated by george h w bush but clinton adopted it with few changes democrats in the 1990s similarly supported the creation of the world trade organization wto agreeing to abide by the decisions of a quasi judicial body in geneva on trade disputes and welcomed china as a member more recently barack obama spent his last two years in office pursuing the trans pacific partnership tpp which he described as a means to box china out in favor of other pacific rim countries but by 2016 the consensus had cracked bernie sanders won more than 40 percent of the democratic party s primary votes in part by renouncing the party s position on trade feeling the pressure from sanders hillary clinton split with obama by turning on the tpp which she had praised as secretary of state defenders of the status quo can still point to the fact that the expansion of global trade has reduced extreme poverty in parts of the developing world but it has become increasingly difficult to deny that a flood of imports particularly from china has contributed to downward mobility among working class americans in 2016 a team of economists published a groundbreaking study that found that the direct and indirect effects of chinese imports had cost more than a million americans their jobs since 2001 and dramatically reduced their lifetime income meanwhile the resentment created by the global trading system has helped fuel the resurgence of reactionary political movements in the u s and europe contradicting the notion that free trade promotes international stability adding to the intellectual wreckage predictions that free trade would nudge china toward liberalizing have become an embarrassing reminder of just how naive the architects of our trade policies were how can liberals move beyond this past while also making clear that they have a better alternative to trump s incoherent and jingoistic approach in many ways the answer lies with an idea originally proposed by new deal types back in the roosevelt and truman administrations they rejected the use of tariffs simply to protect the interests of financiers and plutocrats yet they also understood as subsequent generations would forget that there is no such thing as truly free trade all trade depends on rules and unless markets operate under the right ones they will tend toward capitalistic excess including dangerous degrees of industry concentration and the exploitation of workers and the environment which is why the architects of the postwar system got fifty three nations to sign off on a treaty known as the havana charter which included rules that guaranteed workers rights provided protections against destructive foreign investor behavior and required trading nations to abide by anti monopoly rules alas this part of their vision was never realized but today it provides a blueprint for how we can build a fair and sustainable trading system in the twenty first century getting our heads straight on trade first requires sweeping away a good deal of unfortunate conventional wisdom as an undergraduate at stanford in the late 1980s i learned like most everyone who takes introductory economics that tariffs are bad any policy that restrained foreign competition was a form of protectionism that coddled inefficient domestic industries and raised consumer prices free trade might lead to some job losses but by letting every country specialize in what it did best the world would grow ever more prosperous convinced that opening up global trade contributed to the public good i gladly worked for a private law firm pushing the implementation of nafta and the wto in 2003 i was honored and thrilled to join the team of lawyers at the office of the united states trade representative an agency within the white house that leads trade negotiations it was a busy time the bush administration was negotiating a raft of bilateral and regional trade agreements along with efforts to strike a new deal at the wto this was when i began to realize that the real world of trade policy was nothing like what i d learned in school what i saw was not a brotherhood of men seeking to create open and efficient markets to allocate resources to their highest valued use instead i saw a system beset by a tangle of special interests heavily oriented toward maximizing returns to capital at the expense of workers and the environment in 2003 i was honored and thrilled to join the team of lawyers at the office of the u s trade representative this was when i began to realize that the real world of trade policy was nothing like what i d learned in school one of the few things trump gets right is that the united states continually gets taken advantage of by its trading partners in the u s we at least require our decisionmaking to be public and based on an evidentiary record but many of our trading partners make decisions in black boxes discriminating against our exports in ways that are impossible to challenge because we simply can t get our hands on the facts meanwhile wto bureaucrats have blocked the u s from using a certain methodology to calculate tariffs to address unfair trade the result is that we can t fully protect our domestic industries when other nations cheat the dynamic never changes in the 1970s we complained that germany needed to export less and spend more at home today we complain that germany needs to export less and spend more at home in the 1970s we complained that japan needed to export less and import more today we complain that japan needs to export less and import more in the interim we designed an entirely new trading system the wto and yet we have precisely the same grievances that s to say nothing about china which puts our traditional trading partners to shame when it comes to working the system china s theft of intellectual property draws the most attention because the trump administration has used it to justify tariffs on chinese imports but the more serious threat is chinese industrial policy which is not only state run but is also designed to subsidize exports as a means of gaining an edge against foreign competition after the financial crisis china pumped several hundred billion dollars of subsidies into its steel aluminum and solar panel industries in the short term that meant lower prices for buyers of steel and aluminum products in the u s and elsewhere but by propping up its unprofitable companies china forced factories elsewhere around the world into bankruptcy reducing global competition and concentrating production within its borders now china is expanding its loss leading strategy to other industries in which americans still have some edge like aerospace pharmaceuticals and information technology nor would the tpp which obama sold as a way to contain china s fast growing influence have helped trade negotiators accepted complex supply chain rules in the agreement that would have actually benefited chinese car part producers by increasing the percentage of a tpp made car that could be imported from china in other words china would have been a de facto beneficiary to an agreement designed to exclude it the incoherence of our trade policies isn t just a product of ignorance far from it instead it often derives from the outsize political power exercised by american corporations including the concentrated pharmaceutical and agribusiness industries american agricultural conglomerates make sure the rules essentially require u s farmers to buy their seeds many corporations have built their business models around offshoring production so they can source cheaper components without passing those savings on to consumers that s why many of america s biggest trading corporations actually support rules that let countries like china free ride whether it s nafta the new nafta or the tpp big american drug companies want the u s to put a priority on convincing other nations to secure and extend patent monopolies the name for this regime is free trade the derogatory term for those who raise questions about it is protectionist somehow some people imagine that staying on this path will one day lead to an actual open and efficient market so where does this leave people looking to break from both the obvious failures of mainstream u s trade policy and from trump s xenophobic america first ism to answer that question we have to get the story straight about what the original liberal democratic vision for international trade was and how it was compromised that story starts after world war i democratic president woodrow wilson s fourteen points included a demand for the removal so far as possible of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance but the senate rejected wilson s global vision and congress continued to favor tariffs after world war ii many liberals both here and abroad vowed not to repeat the previous generation s mistakes this did not mean embracing laissez faire indeed many liberals in this era drew a direct line from the excessive power of unregulated monopoly capitalism in the 1920s and 30s to the rise of fascism nor did postwar liberals have any illusions about unrestrained capitalism benefiting workers but they understood that properly structured trade could be a great force for building peace and prosperity so they sought a new global trading order that would slash tariffs and encourage the growth of international trade on the one hand while minimizing the political influence of corporations and protecting the rights of workers on the other to postwar liberals free trade thus meant a world in which strong international institutions would set fair market rules including fair labor standards disciplines on foreign investors and anti monopoly provisions the mechanism for achieving these ends was supposed to be the havana charter drawing on an idea originally floated by fdr s favorite economist john maynard keynes it called for the creation of a body to be known as the international trade organization and charged it with enforcing rules that would protect the rights of labor and put constraints on other abuses by financiers and corporations by march 1948 fifty three countries including the u s had signed on to postwar liberals free trade meant a world in which strong international institutions would set fair market rules including fair labor standards disciplines on foreign investors and anti monopoly provisions the mechanism was supposed to be the havana charter but although harry truman signed the charter his repeated efforts to persuade congress to ratify it fell short and his administration at last had to give up in 1950 business interests opposed the charter claiming that its constraints on capitalism were inconsistent with the american free enterprise system even though fair labor standards and antitrust rules were fully embedded in the american free enterprise system of the era at the same time leaders in both parties had come to fear that war torn nations in europe and asia could fall into the orbit of soviet communism or resurgent fascism if the united states didn t help them recover american corporations knew they wouldn t get to sell foreign countries the supplies they needed to rebuild unless these countries were given the means to pay postwar planners therefore used foreign aid policies like the marshall plan to promote an even more extreme form of industrial interdependence than the havana charter had imagined there was also strong bipartisan support for making major asymmetrical trade concessions while foreign countries recovered from the devastation of the war for roughly two decades these policies generally worked soviet expansion was contained and countries like japan and germany were set on the road to becoming prosperous peaceful and democratic fully integrated industrially with the u s and other key allies meanwhile we didn t yet feel the absence of fair labor and anti monopoly standards but by the 1970s it had become much clearer that these arrangements were beginning to harm american workers and businesses unnecessarily in the early 70s richard nixon grew frustrated that increasingly prosperous european and japanese trading partners continued to throw up obstacles to u s imports so his administration and gerald ford s after it sought to get better behavior out of our trading partners by expanding the u s commitment to a mechanism known as the general agreement on tariffs and trade which was supposed to tie everyone to a more rule bound trade regime but in 1979 president carter presented with a new gatt deal concluded that it was better to accept a deal without fair labor standards than to have no deal at all if the 1970s presented one missed opportunity to achieve a truly liberal trade policy the 1990s presented a second with the collapse of the soviet union the u s might have decided that it no longer had any geopolitical need for trade concessions that threatened the well being of its workers and communities and the resiliency of its industrial base instead many democrats embraced nafta and the creation of the wto the clinton administration also pressed to loosen trade restrictions on autocratic china which in hindsight was a mistake under these policies more and more american manufacturing moved offshore and foreign producers gained still more asymmetrical access to our markets all without agreeing to abide by basic labor and environmental protections where the u s did use its chips it was in the service of corporate profits expanding patent protections for u s drug companies and giving the investor class the unique ability to sue governments ultimately extending to challenges to regulations that impinge on investors profits these decisions represented a further departure from the liberal principles set out by the havana charter whereas the architects of that agreement believed in constraints on capital through fair labor standards anti monopoly rules and disciplines on foreign investor interference with domestic policies mainstream democrats in the 1990s didn t even contemplate that these rules might be necessary at this point the influence of libertarianism was near its zenith among academic economists their former students including many self styled liberals were going out into the world while suffering from the same cognitive capture that had happened to me at stanford today s liberals and anyone else trying to determine the right position on trade can learn from the mistakes and missed opportunities of the past to start with we need to return to and update the trade principles in the havana charter those principles include engineering fair competitive markets designed to limit corporate power this is a particular problem in the context of increasing corporate concentration as giant corporations have gained economic power they have also gained political power which has been used to undermine health labor environmental and other regulation blowing up the outsize influence of corporations including the power of nominally american corporations that take advantage of lax chinese health labor and environmental standards through offshoring is a precondition for doing anything serious about inequality or climate change we also cannot continue to justify our trade policies on the basis of consumerism not only are benefits to consumers assumed rather than proven we also must consider the rights of working class americans to a fair shot at the american dream and on the ability of small and midsize american firms to stay in business without needing to bust unions cut benefits or offshore their operations in some instances achieving these goals will require the u s to cut trade with certain nations or at least retain the ability to credibly threaten to do so that means we will need to be ambitious in reconceiving the way the international trading system works it needs to have strong labor and environmental standards it needs to prevent bureaucrats in geneva from making up rules and it needs to address the fact that chinese state capitalism which is monopolistic in nature is fundamentally incompatible with the free enterprise system the original architects created the concentration of vital industrial capacities in a few nations or only one is dangerous for the global system trump s abrasive attack on the wto has shaken things up therein lies the opportunity liberals care about systemic problems like income inequality and the destruction of the environment as we look ahead to 2020 and contemplate bold policy ideas like the green new deal it should be natural for us to expect the global trading system to be part of the solution not part of the problem we have the chance to make the system fit our purposes in the modern era let s do it
john smith former oil rig worker bus driver telecommunications engineer longtime activist in the anti war and latin american solidarity movements and author of imperialism in the twenty first century globalization super exploitation and capitalism s final crisis monthly review press january 2016 discusses the question of imperialism in the following interview taken by farooque chowdhury during july 2018 february 2019 the interview in slightly abridged form originally appeared on mr online on march 19 22 and 23 2019 following is the 3rd part of the four part interview constraints of imperialism q 10 what constraints is imperialism facing today js just six words but you could not ask a bigger question the financialization phenomenon discussed in preceding answer and the immense over accumulation of capital which it has fostered is the surest sign that imperialist capitalism is heading towards a cataclysmic crisis since the financiers ability to use debt to amplify profit streams and inflate asset values is finite their ability to resume this peculiar form of wealth generation despite the temporary interruption of the global financial crisis has crucially depended on the zero interest rate policy zirp implemented by the central banks of the imperialist nations the usa s federal reserve has raised its interest rate nine times since november 2015 each time by 0 25 but once inflation of around 2 is subtracted from its current level of 2 5 the real interest rate in the usa is barely above zero central banks in the uk europe and japan are yet to follow the fed in moving away from zirp their real interest rates are strongly negative official interest rates sometimes called the base rate reflect the cost of money to private banks large corporations and wealthy investors and are much lower than those charged on loans to households and small businesses it should not be thought that power over interest rates allows governments and central banks to dictate market conditions rather it is the markets i e the owners of finance capital who exercised dictatorship over governments and central banks the official interest rate reflects the so called natural rate of interest determined by the supply of and demand for investment funds the supply is vast yet it is faced with a dearth of productive investment opportunities there is plenty that needs doing but capitalists calculate that expected profits are insufficient to balance risks why is this so important unless capitalists think they will make more money by investing their cash in the production of goods and services than what they d earn in interest if they left it in the bank they will not invest by pushing interest rates down towards zero or even into negative territory central banks hope that capitalists will be stimulated to invest their cash and not just stash it in the bank ultra low interest rates are therefore a sign of deep crisis signifying that capitalists are exceedingly reluctant to invest either because of a dearth of profitable investment opportunities or because they perceive the risk of losing their money to be too high or both given that real interest rates are lower than at any time in the history of capitalism for the rate of investment to be so low whether this is measured as a proportion of gdp or as a fraction of available funds for investment in the imperialist economies and in much of the rest the world is truly astonishing there are lots of complications which could be explored and qualifications which could be made about all of this but i now want to move to a slightly different subject given that ultra low interest rates are a sign of deep malaise how could they also be a means to support and further inflate the value of all manner of financial assets from stocks and shares to bonds to real estate simply because ultra low interest on cash deposits in banks encourage the owners of this cash to purchase stocks and shares residential or commercial property bonds anything which gives them title to a stream of profits or of rents or of interest payments that include a risk premium not only that ultra low interest rates encourage banks large corporations and very rich people to borrow money in order to purchase even more financial assets leading one morgan stanley banker to describe zero interest rate policy as crack cocaine for the financial markets and so it is that the extreme monetary policies pursued by central banks since 2008 and indeed in the decade before the financial crisis have created money making opportunities for the super rich on a scale never seen before in human history an indication of this can be gleaned from cap gemini s annual world wealth reports which report that the total wealth in the hands of the world s high net worth individuals that is people who own more than 1 million in investable assets more than doubled in the 10 years following the beginning of the global crisis growing from 32 8 trillion in 2008 to 70 2 trillion in 2017 an increase of 114 in just 10 years yet during the same period global gdp increased by only 27 adjusted for inflation these figures translate to 100 growth in hnwi wealth compared to a 24 growth in global gdp the final detail to be added to this picture concerns the consequences of these extreme monetary policies ultra low interest rates have encouraged capitalists to borrow money to finance investments but instead of investing in new means of production the bulk of it has financed speculation in markets inflating asset bubbles that are reflected in ballooning hnwi wealth discussed above or in so called intellectual property ip which generates monopoly rents for its owners but does not increase social wealth and in many cases reduces it or to finance share buy backs which increase the wealth of shareholders but which again do not result in any increase in the production of goods and services governments and central bankers are aware that all of this is storing up immense problems for the future yet the capitalists they serve have become addicted to this crack cocaine and so far only the usa has taken timid steps to restore interest rates to what they call normal levels the great fear is that if ultra low interest rates have stimulated asset inflation higher interest rates will result in asset deflation in other words another financial crash and if they leave interest rates where they are not only will asset bubbles debt mountains and other pathological disorders continue to get worse central banks will be deprived of the chief tool they need to prevent the next cyclical recession from rapidly gaining momentum and provoking another financial crash recall that in the last three recessions in the united states the federal reserve has slashed interest rates by an average of 5 but this option is unavailable right now because the fed s policy rate is currently 2 5 or 0 5 when inflation is taken into account and still less is it available to central banks in the uk europe and japan where real interest rates are currently well into negative territory global yields lowest in 500 years of recorded history 10 trillion of negative rate bonds this is a supernova that will explode one day in the words of leading bond trader bill gross the metaphor is apt a supernova occurs when the energy fueling a star s expansion becomes balanced by the gravitational force pulling it towards the centre it may take eons to arrive at this moment but when it does the star collapses on itself in seconds and then explodes scattering debris throughout its galaxy so to get back to the question the chief constraints confronting imperialism are those that arise from capitalism s own internal contradictions and these manifest themselves in the systemic crisis briefly described above their fundamental root lies in the nature of capital which can be defined as self expanding wealth that is wealth which appears to grow magically by itself a goose which lays golden eggs but whose growth as karl marx proved in capital depends on unpaid wealth generated by exploited workers which marxists call surplus value augmented by wealth captured from working people employed in non capitalist sectors of the economy so called accumulation by dispossession as briefly described above the financial system has allowed capitalism to turbo charge capital accumulation through the generation of vast quantities of fictitious capital but in the end every single one of the 70 trillion in the hands of hnwis can only become capital and remain as capital thanks to surplus value extracted from living labor thus the fundamental constraint is the extreme and growing disproportion between the total mass of wealth in the hands of capitalists on the one hand and the quantity of surplus value it is capable of extracting from living labor in order to convert this wealth into capital on the other and as lenin explained it is precisely this disproportion which impels capitalism onto its imperialist trajectory q 11 is it different from the days lenin defined imperialism js fundamentally it is no different what is different is that these contradictions are many magnitudes deeper and are also far more extensive when lenin wrote his famous book on imperialism in the middle of world war i capitalism had yet to fully impose its social relations on the peoples of africa asia and latin america the relation between imperialist nations and subject nations was a relation between capitalism and pre capitalist social formations this is one reason why i believe that capitalism s contradictions are immeasurably deeper now than they were in the period that led to world war i and to the russian revolution q 12 how is imperialism trying to overcome the constraints it is facing today js by escalating its assault on workers and poor people by fighting to reverse the expensive concessions it has made to pacify the working class in imperialist countries by intensifying its rape of mother earth by increasingly resorting to beggar thy neighbor policies as manifested in currency manipulation trade wars and the disintegration of multilateral institutions imperialist camps q 13 is it possible now to define imperialist camps what these camps are how these camps are behaving with each other it s observed that one faction of imperialism is opposed to a free trade agreement while another faction is going after it fights among imperialist powers are going on in the world trade organization there s increase in protectionism what signifies these developments js the process by which economic contradictions translate into political rivalry and military confrontation is extremely complex and depends on many things including contingencies such as the emergence onto the stage of history of mavericks like donald trump or the outcome of a finely balanced referendum such as the one that led britain to decide to withdraw from the european union it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty how the post wwii us led imperialist world order will break up just that it will break up will the franco german alliance survive the next stage of the european union death agony will the usa maintain its close embrace of japan the country it nuked in 1945 will china forge its own sphere of influence and take the next steps towards becoming an imperialist power only by discussing the past and the present can we get a glimpse of the future all i can say for sure is that there is a massive storm coming and that the only way out is for workers to cease their reliance on any wing of the bourgeoisie and do what russia s workers and farmers did in 1917 and what cuban workers and farmers did in 1959 to take power into their own hands to carry out a socialist revolution
the new government and the mission made significant progress in the discussions of the economic policies and reforms that could be supported by a new imf arrangement washington d c united states of america april 4 2019 apo group são tomé and príncipe s economy is experiencing strong imbalances and slower growth reversing large deficit spending of 2018 and implementing comprehensive structural reforms in energy and tourism sectors are needed to unleash the growth potential significant progress was made in the discussions on the economic policies and reforms that could be supported by a new imf arrangement a staff team from the international monetary fund imf led by xiangming li visited são tomé and príncipe during march 20 april 4 2019 for discussions on a new program supported by the imf s three year extended credit facility ecf arrangement at the end of the visit ms li issued the following statement the new government and the mission made significant progress in the discussions of the economic policies and reforms that could be supported by a new imf arrangement this proposed program aims to improve internal and external balances through restoring fiscal sustainability and enhancing macro stability which are essential for a conducive environment to boost inclusive and robust growth progress under a program that expired at end 2018 was limited preliminary data show that central government debt declined by 10 percent of gdp during 2015 18 however the state owned utility company emae accumulated losses and arrears of an almost equal amount consequently consolidated public debt which includes emae s debt declined by only 2 percent of gdp the tax revenue to gdp ratio decreased to 12 5 percent significantly below the average of the region about 16 0 percent meanwhile some structural reforms advanced including regularization of the government s arrears to enco on oil price subsides establishing an automatic fuel price mechanism and developing a management improvement plan and a least cost production plan for emae overall progress was limited due to low capacity delayed implementation of reforms and policy slippages particularly during the election years of 2016 and 2018 the economy is currently experiencing strong imbalances during 2018 the domestic fiscal deficit widened significantly this along with lower external inflows contributed to a drop in international reserves by about 16 million 1 4 months of imports of goods and services growth slowed to below 3 percent of gdp aggravated by electricity shortages while inflation picked up to 9 percent at end 2018 driven by the higher prices of fuel and locally produced fish and vegetables the mission welcomes the government s commitment to placing public finances on a sustainable footing by closing the large gap between revenue and expenditure which is essential to rein in inflation and relieve pressure on the country s international reserves recognizing the importance of protecting essential social services such as health education and the social safety net for the poor as well as the need to improve and maintain infrastructure to support development the authorities plan to prioritize spending carefully given limited resources supported by the world bank the authorities are implementing a social program with a conditional cash transfer component which is expected to reach 91 percent of extremely poor households to generate adequate funding for priority spending they also plan to broaden the tax base and ensure equitable tax burden sharing by curtailing tax evasion in this context they plan to introduce a vat which will replace some current taxes and broaden the tax base and will not affect low income households significantly the mission discussed with the authorities other measures to enhance external and financial stability and boost international reserves a new payment system allowing credit card payments is being developed which will stimulate tourism and raise foreign exchange receipts the mission encouraged the authorities to tighten monetary policy to incentivize more dobra savings and ease the pressure on international reserves the government also plans to strengthen banking supervision to enhance financial stability and remove structural bottlenecks that hinder efficiency and financial inclusion over the medium term comprehensive structural reforms are needed to unleash the country s growth potential in particular rehabilitating emae to cost recovery over time is key to ensuring the country s energy safety as emae currently can only pay a fraction of its imported oil supply in addition reliable low cost and increased supply of electricity is essential for economic development to fully capture the potential of tourism the government plans to develop fisheries and eco agriculture to expand the local supply chain as part of the effort to meet the sustainable development goals and support private led inclusive growth the government plans to promote gender equality as well as women s economic empowerment and financial inclusion on which it will host a conference jointly with the imf and un on may 8 9 with concerted efforts and far reaching reforms growth is expected to accelerate gradually in the medium term during the visit the mission met with the president evaristo carvalho prime minister jorge bom jesus minister of planning finance and the blue economy osvaldo vaz minister of foreign affairs elsa pinto minister of infrastructure osvaldo abreu governor of the central bank américo soares de barros president of the national assembly delfim neves president of the príncipe autonomous region josé cassandra the parliamentary economic commission other government officials representatives of the private sector including banks and development partners the mission expresses its deep appreciation to the authorities for their cooperation and policy dialogue it looks forward to active and continued dialogue in the future
buenos aires argentina it seemed like a longshot but anything was possible in the mind of an ambitious 30 year old eduardo elsztain elsztain then living in new york had landed a meeting with the wealthy hungarian american financier george soros a meeting that the bulk of media reports covering elsztain s rise to prominence claim was arranged purely by chance though elsztain was inexperienced and unknown at the time soros saw something he liked in the ambitious argentine so much so that he gave him 10 million without a second thought according to elsztain s recollection we talked for an hour or so and then he asked how much money i thought i could handle i told him i could manage 10 million soros as elsztain remembers it simply said okay no problem soros later explained his seemingly impulsive investment by saying that elsztain knew when to sell and when to buy soros investment not only changed elsztain s fate but argentina s with that 10 million in newly secured funding elsztain and his close associate marcelo mindlin transformed elsztain s grandfather s company inversiones y representaciones s a investments and brokerage inc better known by its spanish acronym irsa into argentina s largest business empire indeed through irsa elsztain has become not only the country s largest landowner and real estate developer but also the dominant force in the country s massive beef and agriculture industry its gold mining industry and its banking system as a result he has been dubbed by the argentine press as simply the landowner in recent years elsztain s business empire has extended far beyond south america and into israel where he owns the majority stake in one of israel s largest conglomerates idb as well as important stakes in several other notable israeli companies israeli media frequently refers to elsztain as south america s richest jew these business interests have made him one of the most powerful oligarchs in both argentina and the zionist state yet muh like british billionaire joe lewis whose activities in argentina are described in detail in part i of this series a litany of crimes schemes and conspiracies lie beneath elsztain s sprawling business empire and his carefully crafted image of a self made man devoted to jewish charity and religious causes notably elsztain s massive business empire is also connected to that of lewis through elsztain s longtime associate and partner marcelo mindlin who co owns argentina s largest private power company with lewis yet while elsztain and mindlin are supremely powerful and influential in their own right they often act as the argentine faces for policies promoted by the global oligarchy to which they are both well connected indeed elsztain and mindlin are connected to elite groups managed by well known and controversial billionaire families like the rockefellers rothschilds and bronfmans through their membership and leadership roles in groups like the council of the americas as well as powerful international zionist organizations these connections to global oligarchy and global zionism have recently prompted elsztain to orchestrate a policy that if enacted would utterly gut argentina s democracy and would amount to a bloodless coup of a country that has long been in the sights of the global elite this article is part ii of a multi part investigative series examining the efforts of the global elite as well as powerful elements of the global zionist lobby and the government of israel to create an independent state out of argentina s southern patagonia region in order to plunder its natural resources and to fulfill long standing zionist interest in the territory that dates back to the founding father of zionism theodore herzl part i which focuses on the de facto parallel state created by british billionaire joe lewis in argentina s patagonia can be read here part ii focuses on eduardo elsztain one of argentina s wealthiest businessmen who is deeply connected to the global elite and global zionist lobbies and his role in a scheme to undercut argentina s democracy by hijacking its voting system starting small elsztain gets golden advice inversones y representaciones s a irsa now argentina s largest real estate company had humble beginnings growing slowly after its founding in 1943 by eduardo elsztain s grandfather isaac elsztain a russian jewish immigrant who arrived in argentina in 1917 after his uncle s unexpected death in 1981 and soon after elsztain had returned from a year abroad in israel elsztain took over the management of the firm dropping out of university to do so when elsztain took over most of irsa s management the firm was struggling and worth barely 100 000 in order to buy irsa shares and definitively take control of the company elsztain turned to his friend marcelo mindlin borrowing 120 000 from him to buy stock in the company the mindlin elsztain partnership would turn spectacularly lucrative and was once called one of the most successful business marriages of menemismo a reference to the presidency of carlos menem that oversaw the privatization wave of the 1990s however it was not until elsztain s fateful meeting with soros that irsa was to become the behemoth it is today now valued at 11 6 billion yet there was another meeting that also helped elsztain secure his future fortune one that has received decidedly less coverage while he lived in new york from 1989 to 1990 prior to meeting soros elsztain made another life changing meeting with the lubavitcher rebbe menachim mendel schneerson of the new york based chabad lubavitch movement often simply referred to as chabad chabad is arguably one of the most influential orthodox hasidic jewish organizations at the international level the times of israel once called it one of the most powerful forces in world jewry and schneerson was its most prominent and final leader schneerson has been touted by followers as a prophetic visionary and pragmatic leader synthesizing deep insight into the present needs of the jewish people with a breadth of vision for its future who also charted the course of jewish history in the post world war ii era among other things schneerson controversially taught that the entire creation exists only for the sake of the jews and was implacably hawkish in regards to israel s military occupation of palestine elsztain himself has characterized his meeting with schneerson as being equally if not more important to his future business success as his meeting with soros according to an account of the meeting published in haaretz the rabbi advised him to sell his holdings on the stock exchange and focus on real estate a suggestion that turned out to be well timed haaretz concluded that the success of the lubavitcher rebbe s golden advice is possibly what drives elsztain today elsztain s deep ties to the chabad movement as well as the long standing interests in argentina of zionists within and outside of chabad particularly regarding control of the country s land and resources with an emphasis on patagonia will be discussed in detail in a subsequent installment of this series for now it is worth noting that chabad s website states that elsztain is honorary president of chabad of argentina and in that capacity has been a crucial partner for all chabad activities in the country and even globally another important point regarding the beginnings of irsa and with it elsztain and mindlin s sprawling business empire is what really inspired george soros to part with 10 million during that happenstance meeting with a young argentine of no renown though the official story goes that elsztain secured his meeting with soros purely by chance argentine newspaper la nación has revealed that this is merely a myth that has been used to create the impression that elsztain s fortune was self made indeed despite the legend that elsztain s core business irsa has tirelessly promoted of a chance soros meeting la nación one of argentina s most prestigious papers wrote the real story is a bit less spectacular elsztain found himself face to face with soros thanks to his contacts that he had been developing inside the jewish community in buenos aires who were responsible for opening the doors of the powerful businessman another myth involves the claim that soros was making a personal investment in elsztain specifically instead as a 1998 new york times article reveals elsztain during that fateful meeting persuaded soros to drop 10 million not on irsa or his own financial brilliance per se but after convincing him that new policies of the argentine government intended to deregulate and privatize the economy were worth a gamble in fact soros had seen an opportunity not necessarily in elsztain as an individual but rather to plunder argentina s public resources via the coming wave of privatization frontmen for the free enterprise revolution soros through his powerful connections to the international global elite and multinational corporations was able to ensure that several lucrative privatizations fell into his lap elsztain and his partner marcelo mindlin as well became top beneficiaries of this crony capitalism as a result of their role as soros argentine frontmen for the duration of their decade long partnership by the time the partnership ended at least publicly in the early 2000s soros made at least 500 million in profits from his investments in partnership with elsztain and mindlin indeed after just eight years of menemismo elsztain and his associates including his brother alejandro and mindlin had become the darlings of wall street s emerging market gurus and argentina s free enterprise revolutionaries elsztain and mindlin currently continue this role as frontmen but after outgrowing soros in the early 2000s became argentine frontmen for the global elite even after splitting up their legendary partnership as will be described in a subsequent section of this article after domingo cavallo a harvard educated economist who served as president of argentina s central bank during the country s military dictatorship became economy minister in 1991 during carlos menem s first presidential term a wave of privatizations took place that were intended to align argentina with the so called washington consensus promoted by the george h w bush administration many of those privatizations were handled by just a handful of law firms one of which was zang bergel and viñes as researcher and author fabian spollansky has noted zang bergel and viñes was one of the motors of the great privatization machine and having been hired as consultants by the menem led government helped oversee the privatizations of key state assets including córdoba waters aguas de córdoba and state oil company ypf during many of these privatizations two of the firm s partners saúl zang and ernesto viñes were also working for irsa then run by the partnership formed by elsztain mindlin and soros and elsztain was among the firm s top clients the overlap generated many conflicts of interest particularly in the privatization of the national savings and insurance bank caja nacional de ahorro y seguro in the course of which zang bergel and viñes consultant contract with the government was canceled when it was revealed that the firm sought to sell the firm to elsztain who was also a client of the firm and employing zang and viñes separately through irsa this bank now known as caja s a was instead privatized and sold off to an italian company and argentina s werthein group the wertheins are closely linked to elsztain through their leadership roles in the international zionist organization the world jewish congress and their ties to elsztain will be expanded upon in a forthcoming installment of this series starting in 1987 the world bank began to lobby argentina s government then led by raúl alfonsín to either privatize or close banco hipotecario nacional or the national mortgage bank which was dramatically restructured in 1992 under menem s presidency the bank had traditionally been used to provide extended low interest loans to argentines particularly those of lower income and to finance the construction of both private and public works despite the world bank s efforts the bank s executives and employees along with many argentines strongly resisted privatization efforts as a consequence under the presidencies of alfonsín and his successor carlos menem whose policies along with those of his economy minister domingo cavallo were found to have been directly responsible for the collapse of argentina s economy in the early 2000s the bank underwent a deep restructuring that led it to dramatically reduce its staff resulting in the closure of around 60 percent of its total branches in addition according to author and researcher fabián spollansky the state run bank s coffers were manipulated for a variety of purposes that ultimately and as spollansky argues intentionally resulted in a major crisis at the bank that led to its transformation into a wholesale bank in 1992 and to the appointment of pablo espartaco rojo as its president in 1994 espartaco rojo had been serving as sub secretary of deregularization and economic organization of the economy ministry headed by domingo cavallo prior to taking over control of the bank espartaco rojo spent his time as the bank s top executive paving the way for the bank s eventual privatization in 1997 when elsztain s irsa became the top shareholder in the bank after paying 1 2 billion that came not from irsa but from george soros the price to buy the bank was astoundingly low considering that the bank s value according to espartaco rojo was much higher and as high as 6 billion according to some notably one of the consultants hired by espartaco rojo to aid in the bank s privatization process was zang bergel and viñes as president of the bank espartaco rojo had sold the bank s privatization to the country and to its congress by asserting that he would receive at minimum 3 billion for the bank s privatization funds that would then be placed in a new federal fund for regional infrastructure that would finance the building of public works throughout the country a promise that was never fulfilled as only 1 2 billion was received and the fund did not build any public works overseeing the privatization along with espartaco rojo was then economy minister roque fernández a neoliberal chicago boy who was also a former world bank and imf official calls were later made to investigate fernández and espartaco rojo and other parties involved in the highly irregular privatization of the bank but went nowhere one of the key people accused of involvement in illegal activities that led to the bank s privatization is daniel marx who was chief negotiator of argentina s external debt from 1989 to 1993 and is closely linked to the global financial elite through his investment bank quantum finanzas after the privatization espartaco rojo stayed on as the bank s president until 2000 the president of the bank after espartaco rojo was miguel kiguel who had been undersecretary of finance and chief advisor to the minister of the economy of argentina under menem and most crucially chief economist at the world bank at the very time that the world bank was pressuring argentina s government to privatize banco hipotecario after the bank s privatization many of elsztain s associates were rewarded with positions on the bank s board including saúl zang and ernesto viñes as well as mario blejer who is the bank s vice president blejer was a senior adviser to the imf for decades as well as a former president of argentina s central bank as president of the central bank he attempted to force the dollarization of the argentine economy during its collapse and debt default a crisis engineered by menem and cavallo s policies blejer is also a long time associate of elsztain and a member of irsa s board of directors as well as a former adviser to the bank of england and was considered a front runner to head israel s central bank in both 2013 and 2018 another notable director at the bank was jacobo julio driezzen former alternate executive director of the imf sub secretary of finances at the economy ministry during the lead up to argentina s economic collapse and executive director of galicia capital markets a subsidiary of banco galicia one of argentina s largest private banks as will be shown in an upcoming article in this series the privatization of banco hipotecario was just one of many irregular privatizations during the presidency of carlos menem that article will also reveal how menem s policies as well as those of his economy ministers directly resulted in the economic crisis argentina faced in the early 2000s in which the global elite including controversial figures connected to eduardo elsztain henry kissinger the rockefellers and others sought to use this engineered crisis to pressure argentina s government to swap their debt for the entirety of patagonia that effort was ultimately unsuccessful however a similar collapse is now being engineered under the current presidency of mauricio macri a close ally of elsztain and mindlin with patagonia again in the crosshairs as was noted in part i of this series the global elite and particularly powerful elements of the global zionist lobby have long sought to create an independent state out of patagonia for several reasons with the goal of dominating its rich natural resources freshwater and oil among them a dizzying flow chart of tentacles elsztain s acquisition of banco hipotecario was just one of the many moves made by him in partnership with soros and mindlin that have resulted in his multi billion dollar net worth and the largest business empire in argentina yet as has been shown none of that would have been possible without elsztain s connections to the elite and to argentina s government today irsa under elsztain s reign has become a true corporate behemoth and the country s largest real estate company its portfolio encompasses nearly all of argentina s top shopping centers including alto palmero abasto and patio bullrich among others as well as real estate in high demand areas throughout buenos aires and a slew of rented offices and homes and luxury hotels and resorts throughout the country however irsa is but a part of elsztain s empire a key component of which is the agricultural commodities company cresud originally founded in 1937 elsztain began buying cresud shares in 1992 and then purchased a majority stake in 1994 paying around 25 million for control of the company after the purchase soros put nearly 62 million into the company which then went public with soros backing on the new york stock exchange irsa then became owned by cresud with elsztain retaining control of both according to a haaretz profile on elsztain it is not known whether or to what extent he leveraged i e borrowed funds at a lower rate of interest than he expected to make for the purpose of acquiring control in cresud in which he has a 38 percent stake today cresud run by elsztain s brother alejandro elsztain is one of the country s top producers of beef and grain and dominates argentine agribusiness organizations after his acquisition of cresud with the help of soros and mindlin elsztain became only more aggressive in his pursuit of both urban and rural properties after the mexican economic crisis in 1994 and 1995 which paid off according to the new york times as was noted in part i of this series that economic crisis in mexico the effects of which spread throughout latin america including argentina was partly due to the currency speculation conducted by another soros associate british billionaire joe lewis who had broken the bank of england with soros just a few years prior using similar tactics spurring the crisis from which elsztain benefited via cresud and irsa lewis is the co owner of argentina s largest private electricity company pampa energía with the other co owner being long time elsztain associate marcelo mindlin cresud is believed to be one of the largest if not the largest landowners in argentina possessing an estimated 2 5 million acres in addition to even more farmland that it leases it has been the driving force behind the destruction of family farms in argentina the mass planting of gmo soybeans and the introduction of corn fed beef feedlots undermining argentina s long standing reputation of providing high quality grass fed beef tellingly the new york times praised cresud under elsztain s management for smashing the nation s quaint tradition of inefficient underfinanced family farms and ranches many of cresud s land holdings can be found in argentina s patagonia aside from cresud s and irsa s sizeable land holdings and business interests in patagonia elsztain owns an estimated 100 000 hectares 247 000 acres near san carlos de bariloche while mindlin owns around 40 000 hectares 98 800 acres just a few miles away from the similarly large property of joe lewis whose parallel state in this area of patagonia was the subject of part i of this series cresud s control over land and agribusiness extends far beyond argentina and into other south american nations such as brazil paraguay and bolivia through brasilagro in which cresud bought a controlling stake cresud also holds a major stake in the elsztain controlled bank banco hipotecario as well as another massive argentine real estate company apsa the spectacular growth of elsztain s business empire led the new york times to write that his fortunes are increasingly intertwined with the fortunes of nation at the time soros held about one quarter of the shares of both companies according to the times though elsztain eventually severed his business ties with soros in 2000 and took complete control of the now massive business empire yet this empire of elsztain s had been built with much more than help from soros indeed other key shareholders of irsa who helped finance the acquisition of cresud brasilagro and other key holdings of elsztain s were three north american billionaires all known for their zionist activism sam zell american real estate magnate michael steinhardt legendary hedge fund manager and chairman of genie energy s strategic advisory board and edgar bronfman whose fortune was made by the seagram distilleries and universal studios among others bronfman former president of the world jewish congress who was known for his closeness to the clintons had known elsztain long before as the two had previously met in israel in addition to the help provided by powerful billionaires the growth of elsztain s empire was notably aided by the government of argentina on my occasions not only during menem s presidency but also under the presidencies of nestor kirchner his wife and successor cristina fernández de kirchner and more recently mauricio marci one clear example of this government furnished aid is the fact that argentina s social security administration anses which funds the majority of argentina s recently gutted social programs is heavily invested in and has been used to buy shares of a raft of elsztain and mindlin owned companies including irsa cresud alto palmero sa pampa energia edenor and petrobras argentina in at least two cases anses has been used by both elsztain and mindlin to fraudulently acquire companies and expand their business empires elsztain and israel in 2012 elsztain made a gamble to begin building a new business empire not in argentina but in israel his leap into israel s market took many by surprise not for his decision to invest in the country but where and with whom he had decided to invest that september news broke that elsztain had offered embattled israeli businessman nochi dankner 25 million to keep the latter s sprawling business empire idb israel s largest holding company afloat not only that but he promised to infuse an additional 75 million in the near future to the shock of israel s financial sector and even idb shareholders who had increasingly lost faith in dankner elsztain s reasons for investing so heavily and seemingly out of nowhere to prop up a controversial israeli tycoon and prop up idb led to considerable speculation in israeli media notably haaretz asserted that it was likely linked to elsztain s long standing zionist activism as well as a religious spiritual element stemming from his closeness to the new york based chabad movement indeed elsztain had been introduced to dankner by chabad rabbi yoshiyahu pinto whose father in law shlomo ben hamo is the chief rabbi of argentina pinto has been an important figure in past investments of elsztain and his role as well as those of other chabad rabbis in elsztain s business activities including the unscrupulous will be discussed in a subsequent article in this series haaretz further noted that the 25 million gamble would likely cause controversy in elsztain s home country of argentina given that the money originated from elsztain s irsa in which anses is heavily invested thus the israeli paper stated elsztain is taking the money that argentine workers have invested in his companies for their future retirement for his own speculative investment the object of which is to salvage dankner s control of the idb group elsztain s promise of investing 75 million more in dankner s ganden holdings through which he owned idb had fallen flat by july 2013 a decision elsztain had made just a matter of days after becoming idb s deputy chairman though elsztain backtracked on his plans to help dankner maintain his hold on the company elsztain had no plans to abandon his ultimate goal of influence over idb s business empire and joined forces with a relatively unknown israeli businessman moti ben moshe by the end of the year and with help from the israeli court system elsztain and ben moshe had wrested control of the massive holding company from dankner and become its new owners then just two years later elsztain ousted ben moshe and became the sole controlling shareholder of the megacompany elsztain s total investment in idb through irsa and irsa affiliates is now believed to surpass 420 million idb is one of israel s largest companies and among its holdings are israel s largest chain of supermarkets shufersal sometimes written as super sol the cornerstone of the israeli tech industry and parent company of elbit weapon systems elron electronics israel s fourth largest airline israir israeli kosher dairy giant mehadrin and one of israel s largest internet providers cellcom among others soon after elsztain acquired control over idb prominent elsztain allies took top positions at idb subsidiaries for instance matthew bronfman who is in business with the rothschilds and is the son of elsztain ally and associate edgar bronfman became a top shareholder in shufersal while saúl zang elsztain s longtime lawyer and an irsa executive became vice chairman of elron electronics elsztain s sister diana who has long lived in israel was also placed on idb s board another person placed on the idb board by elsztain is giora inbar who used to chair tat technologies an israeli company with u s subsidiaries whose clients include boeing lockheed martin and the u s army in addition benjamin gantz presidential candidate in upcoming israeli elections and former idf chief of staff during the 2014 war with gaza was on the board of directors of elron electronics whose chairman is elsztain until just this past week aside from idb elsztain has also through a separate company dolphin netherlands bv increased his holdings in several other israeli companies these include nova measuring instruments which focuses on artificial intelligence big data and is a key company in global circuit manufacturing as well as paz oil israel s largest oil and gas company another israeli company in which elsztain has sizable holdings is magic software which now plays a key role in argentine elections and will be treated in detail in a subsequent section of this article though his massive israel based business empire is beginning to rival his argentine empire in size and influence elsztain has shown in recent years that he desires to continue expanding his business interests in the zionist state last january news broke that elsztain sought to acquire bezeq israel s largest telecommunications company after its owner eurocom controlled by israeli businessman shaul elovitch was pressured to give up the company by some of israel s largest banks including israel discount bank notably the controlling stake of israeli discount bank is owned by matthew bronfman who is also a main stakeholder in idb company shufersal and whose father was a close associate of elsztain in irsa and at the world jewish congress where matthew bronfman has also held prominent roles despite his friends in high places elsztain has encountered difficulty after difficulty in his efforts to acquire bezeq as a result of israel s anti centralization laws laws that ironically had helped him take control of idb from its previous owner elsztain has tried to sell off idb s cellcom subsidiary bezeq s main rival in order to acquire bezeq but without success he has since turned his efforts to buying eurocom s subsidiaries piece by piece starting with spacecom an israeli satellite operator it remains to be seen if bezeq s recent financial difficulties have given elsztain cold feet or are part of a behind the scenes effort to weaken and then acquire the company given his history both are equally plausible elsztain s ties to and influence in israel will become increasingly important in subsequent installments of this series as israel s government as well as prominent elements of the zionist lobby to which elsztain is connected have been and are involved in past and current efforts to force argentina s governments to relinquish patagonia elsztain representing rockefeller rothschild interests in argentina as argentine newspaper la nación noted in 2005 the argentine businessman with the greatest contacts in the business world and like no other argentine has a direct channel to many of the world s wealthiest men who in many cases become his partner in local projects indeed elsztain and his associates are often the avenue through which international oligarchs insert themselves into argentina s economy and politics first for soros and now for much more powerful figures the council of the americas coa was originally founded in 1963 by david rockefeller as the business group for latin america which two years later became known as the council for latin america and then the center for inter american relations before undergoing a final name change from its founding to its current state the coa has been the voice of the multinational corporations and the oligarchs behind them that represent the vast majority of u s based private investment in latin america the organization is often described as the latin american equivalent of the council on foreign relations cfr which was chaired by david rockefeller for several decades and has long been heavily funded by the rockefeller foundation david rockefeller founded the coa while serving as cfr chairman rockefeller was the coa chairman from 1981 to 1992 and was honorary chairman until his death in 2017 the vast majority of the directors on coa s board are executives of latin american operations of major european and u s multinational corporations such as shell oil jp morgan pepsico chevron boeing citigroup and microsoft one of the group s chairmen after rockefeller was john negroponte who was involved in the reagan era cover up of u s support for latin american death squads and was deeply involved in the creation of the north american free trade agreement nafta which was the brainchild of coa negroponte also served as u s ambassador to iraq and later deputy secretary of state under george w bush and was the first director of national intelligence dni negroponte is currently coa chairman emeritus and on its board of directors the current coa chairman is andrés gulski a former imf official and santander bank executive who is currently ceo and president of aes power company which alongside mindlin and lewis pampa energia is one of the top electricity producers in argentina gulski also served in venezuela s ministry of finance in the u s backed pre chávez government and more recently was on barack obama s export council coa s current president and ceo is susan segal a former jp morgan executive who was actively involved in the latin american debt crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s sitting on many advisory committees as well as serving as chairperson for the chilean and philippine advisory committees while the former country was ruled by a brutal u s backed military dictatorship she also received an award from colombia s then president alvaro uribe who once led colombia s right wing narco death squads while coa has long been formed and funded by western multinational corporations among the handful of latin american based companies that are both elite members and sponsors of the organization are irsa and pampa energia other prominent coa sponsors include citigroup jp morgan and soros open society foundations elsztain and mindlin are also both members of coa and are regular speakers at the annual argentina investment conference that coa jointly hosts with blackrock the world s largest investment management corporation mindlin and elsztain also serve on coa s international advisory council in addition to coa elsztain is a regular attendee of the world economic forum wef or davos as is marcelo mindlin elsztain is also a member of the group of 50 g50 which describes itself as a select group of business leaders who head some of the most significant and forward looking enterprises in latin america membership is by invitation only the g50 was founded in 1993 by moses naím former director of venezuela s central bank and venezuela s minister of trade and industry in the 1990s as well as former executive director of the world bank naím who still chairs g50 is also on the board of directors of soros open society foundations g50 was originally founded with funding from the carnegie endowment for international peace which itself is funded by the rockefeller brothers fund the open society foundations and the u s and u k governments among others naím is also on the board of directors of aes whose president and ceo is also current coa chairman andrés gulski while elsztain and mindlin are both well connected to both george soros and the rockefeller founded council of americas elsztain for his part shares ties with other well known families of oligarchs the rothschilds and the bronfmans elsztain s close ties with the bronfmans and the rothschilds have largely manifested through his prominent positions at the global zionist lobby organization the world jewish congress wjc whose long time president from 1981 to 2007 was edgar bronfman the seagram billionaire who was also a close friend of elsztain and himself a key shareholder in elsztain s irsa elsztain served previously as treasurer and chairman and is currently a vice president of the wjc and chair of the wjc business council the wjc is currently chaired by david de rothschild in addition to his connections to the bronfmans through irsa and wjc elsztain also serves on the board of endeavor argentina the argentine branch of endeavor global whose chairman is edgar bronfman jr the role of the rothschilds bronfmans and wjc in the events currently unfolding in argentina as well as the roles of other pertinent elements of the global zionist lobby will be explored in detail in a subsequent installment of this series however it is worth pointing out that the fortunes of the rothschilds have become increasingly intertwined with those of the rockefellers particularly after rit capital partners bought 37 percent of rockefeller financial services in 2012 as well as those of the bronfmans after the 2013 creation of bronfman e m rothschild e l llc as these powerful oligarch dynasties move closer together the links between these families and elsztain should be cause for concern in light of his role and the roles of his associates in bringing economic upheaval to argentina and then directly profiting from that upheaval indeed as investigative journalist and researcher vanessa beeley told mintpress elsztain s as well as mindlin s connections to these groups and clans of oligarchs betrays their role as the argentine faces of these powerful individuals who seek to claim and exploit argentina s resources elsztain and mindlin s close connections to a merging network of some of the most powerful globalists in the world today suggest their role to be one of sniffing out the opportunities and laying the groundwork for hostile take over of resources and infrastructure by these elite scavengers who prey upon target nations protected from view by the likes of elsztain and mindlin who are little more than mafia outreach agents getting their hooks into the voting machines as the influence of elsztain mindlin and their associates has expanded in argentina as well as in israel this small close knit group of powerful billionaires has now set its sights on consolidating political power in argentina for themselves and their even more powerful backers though the presidency of macri has seen their influence grow in new and troubling ways new evidence shows that elsztain with the backing of the rothschild banking family has set his sights on argentina s voting system for the past few years macri s government has been heavily promoting the need for electronic voting systems in argentina which it argues are needed to modernize the country s current paper ballot system however as has been seen in other countries including the u s where such systems have been implemented the results of elections run on electronic voting systems can be easily manipulated and such manipulations are effectively impossible to detect election forensics specialist jonathan simon author of code red computerized elections and the war on american democracy had this to say about the vulnerability of such voting systems to interference they re often rushed into use with great promises of speed convenience and accuracy but these fully computerized voting systems particularly those that provide no paper record of votes cast have turned out to be problematic to say the least everywhere they have turned up including the u s and several european countries in fact the trend now is to ditch them in favor of return to paper based systems ireland literally turned its voting computers into landfill norway germany the netherlands and gradually the u s have all taken them out of service the reason is simple as computers this voting equipment is vulnerable not only to outsider hacking but to insider manipulation it is trivial to program them to add subtract switch votes and this is true whether or not they are hooked up to the internet the worst part is that there is absolutely no way of verifying or validating the election results spit out by this equipment all the hardware and software has been ruled proprietary corporate property and off limits to inspection by anyone including governments simon also told mintpress that electronic voting machines in contrast to making the voting system more transparent as macri has claimed instead can be used by politicians who wish to remain in power but unaccountable for their actions while in office if i wanted to take over a country stay in power despite doing things that would surely get me voted out i could stage a coup and roll tanks down the streets of the capital or i could install an electronic voting system as macri is trying to do in argentina and as the right wing managed to do in 2002 in the u s and achieve the same result without firing a shot without provoking outrage or resistance and without altering people s perception that they lived in a democracy when you see politicians and powerful figures in a nation pushing such concealed and unverifiable systems for vote counting the first thing you want to do is look past the marketing campaign the talk of transparency which is nonsense speed convenience etc and ask one very simple question why concerns about manipulation only increase when the manufacturers and programmers of those voting systems have troubling connections to oligarchs or foreign governments unfortunately for argentina the electronic voting machines being promoted by macri have many such troubling connections since his 2015 presidential campaign macri has pushed for the implementation of electronic voting nationwide calling it necessary for creating a more transparent voting system by 2017 macri s comprehensive voting reform legislation which called for electronic voting nationwide was passed by argentina s congress only to remain essentially frozen in its implementation as holdovers from the previous administration in the government s bureaucracy have worked to block the nationwide shift to digitized voting notably a recent poll conducted in argentina found that 60 of respondents would never consider voting for macri in future elections though the voting systems were not implemented nationwide they are already being used in many areas of argentina including the city of buenos aires population 2 89 million and the provinces of salta 1 2 million córdoba 3 3 million chaco 1 million tucumán 1 4 million santa fe 3 2 million and the patagonian province of neuquén 0 5 million as a consequence despite the lack of a nationwide system more than 25 percent of argentina s population already votes using electronic machines all of which are incidentally manufactured by a single company magic software argentina msa concerns over msa were voiced early on in argentine media such as a report published in letra p that noted that msa had developed a close relationship with members of macri s inner circle and his political party in prior years suggesting a conflict of interest in addition just last week a man attempting to use an electronic voting machine in the nequén province filmed how the msa made voting machine printed out a result that was entirely different from the one he had chosen prompting him to ask to vote again for his chosen candidate a request that was initially denied after the incident several machines were found to be working improperly though such reports are troubling they barely scratch the surface of msa and the more likely and troubling reasons why this company was given control over the democratic processes in many argentine provinces and if macri gets his way the entire country magic software argentina was created in 1995 by sergio osvaldo orlando angelini and alejandro poznansky and as noted by the argentine outlet el disenso specializes in importing adapting and commercializing informatic systems in argentina as well as representing and being the national face of foreign business like magic software enterprises msa s parent company magic software enterprises mse was originally known as mashov software export and is an israeli software company headquartered in or yehuda in 1991 the company changed its name and became the first israeli software company to be listed on the nasdaq mse has long had a close relationship with israel s military the israel defense forces idf which was reaffirmed in 2010 when mse was tasked with upgrading software systems for the idf and israel s military police el disenso noted in 2017 that mse as a result of having its headquarters in israel as well as a branch in the united states is subject to the jurisdiction of israel as well as north american courts both countries impose strict security protocols that permit their national government practically unlimited access to information while concerns about undue influence or meddling by either the u s and or israel are valid an examination of the power behind msa and its parent company mse reveals something much more troubling as well as just how influential eduardo elsztain has become mse s largest shareholders are idb development corp ltd and clal insurance enterprises holdings ltd and smaller shareholders include the rothschild banking family through the firm edmond de rothschild holdings as previously mentioned idb development corp was acquired by eduardo elsztain in 2015 in addition a majority stake in clal insurance enterprises mse s second largest shareholder is owned by dolphin netherlands b v which incidentally is a subsidiary of irsa and elsztain is chairman of its board in other words the most powerful and influential shareholder in both magic software enterprises and its argentine subsidiary magic software argentina is none other than eduardo elsztain devouring argentina a capitalist feast in many courses in summary through political connections corruption and white collar crime this network of billionaires the most visible of whom is eduardo elsztain has essentially taken control of not only the bulk of argentina s resources its electricity its land its agriculture its water its financial system but also its voting system yet far from being purely an effort of powerful argentine billionaires like elsztain and mindlin control over argentina s economy government industry and land has long been a goal of powerful oligarchs dating back at least 70 years those very figures successfully engineered argentina s economic collapse in the early 2000s and then through intermediaries close to henry kissinger the imf and the world s largest banks greatly pressured its government to relinquish patagonia in exchange for debt relief from the economic chaos they had created the next installment of this investigative series will focus on marcelo mindlin and the interests of the mindlin elsztain network in oil and gas in argentina s patagonia as well as in the contested falkland islands top photo eduardo elsztain president of grupo irsa and banco hipotecario santiago filipuzzi la nacion whitney webb is a mintpress news journalist based in chile she has

washington d c rep tim ryan who is best known outside ohio for mounting a democratic leadership challenge to nancy pelosi after his party lost the white house to donald trump this week joined a crowded field of democratic presidential aspirants who hope to take on trump in 2020 selling himself as a progressive with working class roots who can win back the voters of ohio wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania who were key to trump s victory in 2016 the 45 year old ryan is positioning himself as a fresh face with new ideas to fix a broken system since 2003 ryan has represented a safely democratic district that includes parts of summit portage mahoning trumbull and stark counties over the years he has flirted with bids for higher office whenever no democratic incumbents were running for re election for ohio s gubernatorial or u s senate jobs now he s decided to seek the highest office in the land here s a look at his record and some of the issues he s likely to campaign on in iowa new hampshire and other early presidential primary states 1 jobs and the economy although trump won the presidency by promising he d deliver jobs and revive the economy ryan maintains he hasn t made good on those boasts ryan regards the recent closure of his district s general motors plant in lordstown as a prime example of trump s failures and the congressman has been a visible spokesman for the affected workers he says the federal government should be trying to foster jobs in fields like renewable energy and electric vehicles instead of declining areas like coal mining he also argues for investment in high speed rail highways bridges dams ports and sewers as a way to preserve the nation s global competitiveness the president is selling us the past ryan said after the lordstown closure but our community is ready to move forward we need to come together and shape a future where we have an economy that cuts workers in on the deal as a member of congress ryan has promoted urban renewal projects to create jobs that he helped fund with federal dollars while ryan is pleased with those local efforts he says people are still feeling squeezed because wages are being surpassed by inflation while gas prices and health care costs are up he says recent high stock prices and low unemployment figures are masking deeper problems he has introduced legislation that would encourage worker training and science technology engineering and math education we need a huge rebuild in the united states and to get construction jobs up and running said ryan globalization and automation are not going away we need to reinvest in our communities and lift them up 2 trade ryan was first elected to congress by defeating former akron democratic rep tom sawyer in a congressional primary with support from labor unions who were dismayed by sawyer s support for the north american free trade agreement nafta ryan argues that deals like nafta the central american free trade agreement cafta and the u s korea free trade agreement cost jobs in states like ohio because they helped manufacturers shift production to countries with lower labor costs he has regularly denounced unfair trade practices by china which he says have cost tens of thousands of jobs in ohio ryan says he s closely examining the details of the nafta replacement deal but believes it s important to figure out how rules it contains to help workers and raise wages will be enforced you can have all the great rules you want but it doesn t really matter if they re not enforceable says ryan ryan also says the tariffs trump imposed on dumped steel need to be part of a more aggressive economic strategy to deal with china i implore president trump to keep his word when he came to the mahoning valley last year and promised jobs were all coming back they re all coming back don t move don t sell your house 4 8 congressman tim ryan reptimryan november 26 2018 3 trump although a 2018 review of votes by congressional quarterly found that ryan voted with president trump s issue positions just 14 percent of the time ryan says he approves of some things that trump has done like renegotiating the north american free trade agreement but he says he s disappointed in how he intentionally tries to divide the country and turn groups like immigrants into scapegoats he says trump should focus on doing his job and stop making incendiary comments on twitter even if he wins a political fight he sticks his opponents nose in the mud ryan says he s not a unifier it is a recipe for disaster to be so divided he has also criticized trump for talking tough on the loss of u s jobs to china and mexico while choosing to have his companies neckties made in china his suits made in mexico and his picture frames made in turkey he is preying on economic anxieties said ryan to say one thing and do another in your personal business doesn t really wear well this is not a guy who will be on your side in the most important position in the world 4 immigration another area where ryan differs from trump is immigration he has decried the trump administration s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border during trump s 2018 state of the union address ryan left his guest seat empty to draw attention to the trump administration s decision to deport youngstown businessman amer othman adi who he said no longer resides in the country he s called home for 39 years because the trump administration decided to target upstanding individuals americans in every sense of the word instead of violent criminals who actually pose a threat ryan says he backs comprehensive immigration reform that includes securing the border and creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers who are already in the country he suggested such a pathway should include paying fines and back taxes and learning english if they don t already know it he said the border wall that president trump endorses might make sense in some areas but higher technology measures might work in others he says more border patrol agents should be stationed at areas along the mexican border frequented by drug traffickers since day 1 the trump administration has been taking deliberate action to sabotage our health care system house democrats are fighting back forthepeople to ensure every american has access to affordable and quality health care protectourcare congressman tim ryan reptimryan april 2 2019 5 health care ryan voted for the affordable care act when it was passed and says it s helped millions of americans to secure quality affordable health insurance for themselves and their families in congress he regularly decries republican efforts to dismantle it there is no doubt that the aca can be improved upon but that doesn t mean we should throw the whole thing out and leave millions upon millions of americans with higher premiums less coverage or no insurance at all ryan has said in the wealthiest nation on earth access to quality and affordable care is a right that every american should be afforded ryan also says he d like to see the medicare system opened up for buy ins by small businesses and people as young as age 50 or 55 he says it would be paid for by having those covered pay premiums into the medicare system rather than to private insurers 6 mindfulness ryan is a devotee of yoga and mindfulness which he says is about finding ways to slow down and pay attention to the present moment he wrote a book called a mindful nation how a simple practice can help us reduce stress improve performance and recapture the american spirit and invited author deepak chopra to lead meditation sessions on capitol hill he advocates social emotional learning in the classroom and has obtained funding to subsidize it i don t see my meditation practice as somehow separate from my leadership position or my congressional position or my position as a dad or a husband ryan says in one of his presidential campaign videos it s all the same thing it is your life you can t get on your mat or on your cushion and say oh i want to become one with the universe and one with everything except for politics we need leaders who are really seeing the world with clarity that will be the foundation of the new way of doing things it starts from love 7 veterans ryan s congressional district includes army and air force national guard bases which he strives to fund as a member of the house appropriations committee he is a co chair of the military mental health caucus and has introduced legislation aimed at helping veterans address post traumatic stress disorder and avoid suicide twenty veterans die by suicide every day says ryan that s a staggering number we cannot stand by and allow this to keep happening it s our responsibility in congress to provide the tools and resources to help our veterans get on the path to recovery he regards yoga and meditation as a way to help veterans recover from war trauma we have to really be aggressive and assertive in our mission to go out and seek these veterans out and say you heal yourself by connecting to other vets who have done yoga or meditation or deep breathing or tai chi or acupuncture ryan says in another campaign video to see a veteran who has gone from in a really bad spot to transformational figure it s the most inspirational thing you d ever see in your life 8 food after writing his mindfulness book ryan published another volume called the real food revolution healthy eating green groceries and the return of the american family farm that criticizes processed foods and argues for shifting agricultural subsidies to support farming of fresh fruits and vegetables instead of big producers of corn soy and wheat he says processed foods subsidized by taxpayers contribute to obesity and other problems that require costly medical intervention in recent weeks he s introduced a package of nutrition bills and legislation aimed at eradicating food deserts by setting up a system of tax credits for businesses and nonprofits that serve areas where it s hard to buy affordable or good quality fresh food our food system is broken and ineffective says ryan in a country where obesity and diabetes rates are skyrocketing and where over 20 million people live in food deserts we cannot allow the status quo to continue 9 guns ryan who once had an a rating from the national rifle association announced in 2017 that he d donate the roughly 20 000 its political action committee gave him over the years to gun safety organizations although he enjoys hunting and shooting and says he has no interest in taking guns away from law abiding citizens ryan says he soured on the nra when it opposed universal background checks after the 2012 sandy hook shooting he says gun violence should be studied as a public health issue by the centers for disease control he also supports thorough background checks for all gun purchasers getting weapons of war such as semi automatic weapons off the street and expanded mental health services to fight gun violence 10 abortion ryan backs a woman s right to get an abortion and letting planned parenthood get federal funds anti abortion advocates have tried to pressure congress to stop providing federal family planning dollars to the organization even though planned parenthood says none of the federal money funds abortions he identified as anti abortion until 2015 when he and his wife had a baby and it became very apparent to me in this process that uncle sam should not be in the room with us regardless of how the tests came back with the health of the baby he announced his policy reversal in a 2015 column in the akron beacon journal which explained that ryan considered himself to be pro life after being raised catholic but 14 years in political office gave him a deeper understanding of the complexities and emotions that accompany the difficult decision that women and families make when deciding whether to end a pregnancy where republicans stand on ryan republicans describe ryan as a congressional backbencher with a meager legislative record and no chance to become president you can just add him to the long list of liberal candidates demanding government run health care and it underscores how radical and out of touch this democratic field truly is said a statement from republican national committee communications director michael ahrens ohio republican party communications director evan machan said ryan is a weak congressman who will be an even weaker candidate for president tim ryan has lost to nancy pelosi one of the least popular politicians of our generation not once but twice said machan he has two legislative accomplishments in over 16 years in congress renaming two federal buildings ryan s republican opponent in the last congressional election cuyahoga falls attorney chris depizzo made similar points about ryan and also questioned his commitment to his current job given his many trips to states that hold early presidential primaries voters in ryan s district didn t buy it re electing him with 61 percent of the vote
by john siman who is also the author of part 1 part 2 and part 3 in this series john siman i want to spell out the implications of the points that socrates brought up and with which you and i agree that leaves the question facing us today is the american oligarchy and state as rapacious as that of rome or is it universally the nature of oligarchy in any historical setting to be rapacious and if so where is it all leading michael hudson if antiquity had followed the free market policies of modern neoliberal economics the near east greece and rome would never have gained momentum any such free market avoiding mutual aid and permitting a wealthy class to emerge and enslave the bulk of the population by getting it into debt and taking its land would have shrunk or been conquered from without or by revolution from within that s why the revolutions of the 7thcentury bc led to reformers subsequently called tyrants in greece and kings in rome were necessary to attract populations rather than reduce them to bondage so of course it is hard for mainstream economists to acknowledge that classical antiquity fell because it failed to regulate and tax the wealthy financial and landowning classes and failed to respond to popular demands to cancel personal debts and redistribute the land that had been monopolized by the wealthy the wealth of the greek and roman oligarchies was the ancient counterpart to today s finance insurance and real estate fire sector and their extractive and predatory behavior is what destroyed antiquity the perpetuation of this problem even today two thousand years later should establish that the debt credit dynamic and polarization of wealth is a central problem of western civilization js so what were and are the political and social dynamic at work mh the key is the concept of wealth addiction and how it leads to hubris arrogance that seeks to increase power in ways that hurt other people hubris is not merely over reaching it is socially injurious the wealthy or power injure other people knowingly to establish their power and status that is what aristophanes meant when his characters say that wealth is not like bananas or lentil soup wealth has no object but itself wealth is status and also political control the creditor s wealth is the debtor s liability the key to its dynamic is not production and consumption but assets and liabilities the economy s balance sheet wealth and status in the sense of who whom it seeks to increase without limit and socrates and aristotle found the major example to be creditors charging interest for lending barren money interest had to be paid out of the debtor s own product income or finally forfeiture of property creditors did not provide means of making interest to pay off the loan this is the opposite of austrian school theories that interest is a bargain to share the gains to be made from the loan fairly between creditor and debtor it also is the opposite of neoclassical price theory the economics taught in universities today is based on a price theory that does not even touch on this point the liberty that oligarchs claim is the right to indebt the rest of society and then demand full payment or forfeiture of the debtor s collateral this leads to massive expropriations as did the junk mortgage foreclosures after 2008 when president obama failed to write down debts to realistic market values for real estate financed on loans far beyond the buyer s ability to pay the result was 10 million foreclosures yet today s mainstream economics treats the normal tendency to polarize between creditors and debtors the wealthy and the have nots as an anomaly it has been the norm for the last five thousand years but economics sidesteps actual empirical history as if it is an anomaly in the fictional parallel universe created by the mainstream s unrealistic assumptions instead of being a science such economics is science fiction it trains students in cognitive dissonance that distracts them from understanding classical antiquity and the driving dynamics of western civilization js this gets us back to the question of whether universities should just be shut down and started up all over again mh you don t shut them down you create a new group of universities with a different curriculum the path of least resistance is to house this more functional curriculum in new institutions that s what america s republican and pro industrial leaders recognized after the civil war ended in 1865 they didn t shut down harvard and yale and princeton and the christian free trade anglophile colleges they created state colleges funded by land grants such as cornell in upstate new york and business schools such as the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania endowed by industrialists to providing an economic logic for the state s steel making and related industrial protectionism the result was an alternative economics to describe how america should develop as what they saw as a new civilization free of the vestiges of europe s feudal privileges absentee ownership and colonialist mentality the republicans and industrialists saw that america s prestige colleges had been founded long before the civil war basically as religious colleges to train the clergy they taught british free trade theory serving the new england commercial and banking interests and southern plantation owners but free trade kept the united states dependent on england my book america s protectionist takeoff describes how the american school of political economy led by henry carey and e peshine smith william seward s law partner developed an alternative to what was being taught in the religious colleges this led to a new view of the history of western civilization and america s role in fighting against entrenched privilege william draper s intellectual development of europe and andrew dixon white s history of the warfare of science with theologysaw the united states as breaking free from the feudal aristocracies that were a product of the way in which antiquity collapsed economically and culturally js so business schools were originally progressive mh surprising as it may seem the answer is yes to the extent that they described the global economy as tending to polarize under free trade and an absence of government protectionism not to become more equal they incorporated technology energy use and the environmental consequences of trade patterns into economic theory such as soil depletion resulting from plantation monocultures mainstream economics fought against such analysis because it advocated markets free for polluters free for nations to pursue policies that made them poorer and dependent on foreign credit js so this is how the wharton school s first professor of economics simon patten one of the founders of american sociology fits into this anti rentier tradition that is such a revelation to me they developed an analysis of technology s effects on the economy of monopoly pricing and economic rent as unearned income that increases the cost of living and cost of production they explained the benefits of public infrastructure investment today that is called socialism but it was industrial capitalists who took the lead in urging such public investment so as to lower their cost of doing business mh the first u s business schools in the late 19thcentury described rentiers as unproductive that is why today s neoliberals are trying to rewrite the history of institutionalism in a way that expurgates the americans who wanted the government to provide public infrastructure to make america a low cost economy undersell england and other countries and evolve into the industrial giant it became by the 1920s js that was simon patten s teaching at the wharton school government subsidized public infrastructure as the fourth factor of production mh yes america s ruling political class tried to make the united states a dominant economy instead of a rentiereconomy of landlords and financial manipulators js how did the robber barons fit into this story mh not as industrialists or manufacturers but as monopolists opposed by the industrial interests it was teddy roosevelt s trust busting and the republicans that enacted the sherman antitrust act its spirit was continued by franklin roosevelt js is today s economy a second age of robber barons mh it s becoming a second gilded age an abrupt change of direction in economic trends occurred after ronald reagan and margaret thatcher were elected in 1979 80 the result has been to invert what the 19th century economists understood to be a free market that is a market free from a privileged hereditary class living on unearned income in the form of land rent monopoly rent and financial extraction js i was in my first few years of college when thatcher came in in 1979 and when reagan was elected in 1980 i asked my economics professors what was going on but i could not find a single professor to coherently describe the u turn that was occurring it certainly wasn t in paul samuelson s textbook that we were given mh there s little logic for neoliberalism beyond a faith that short term greed is the best way to optimize long term growth it is natural for the wealthiest classes to have this faith neoliberalism doesn t look at the economy as a social system and it excludes as externalities concerns with the environment debt dependency and economic polarization it only asks how to make a short term hit and run gain regardless of whether this is done in a way that has a positive or negative overall social effect realistic economic logic is social in scope and distinguishes between earned and unearned income that is why economists such as simon patten and thorstein veblen decided to start afresh and create the discipline of sociology to go beyond narrow individualistic economics being taught today s mathematical economics is based on circular reasoning that treats all that has happened as having been inevitable it is all survival of the fittest so it seems that there is no alternative this policy conclusion is built into economic methodology if we weren t the fittest we wouldn t have survived so by definition that is circular reasoning any alternative is less than fit regarding the fact that you had to read samuelson when you were in college he was famous for his factor price equalization theorem claiming to prove mathematically that everybody and every nation tends naturally to become more and more equal if government stands aside he denied that the tendency of the global economy is to polarize not equalize the political essence of this equilibrium theory is its claim that economies tend to settle in a stable balance in reality they polarize and then collapse if they do not reverse their polarizing financial and productivity and wealth dynamics are the starting point of economic theorizing should explain the dynamic that lead economics to polarize and collapse that is the lesson of studying antiquity that we have discussed in our earlier talks writers in classical antiquity like bronze age near eastern rulers before them and the biblical prophets recognized that a rentier economy tends to destroy the economy s productivity and widespread prosperity and ultimately its survival in today s world the finance insurance and real estate sector and monopolies are destroying the rest of the economy using financial wealth to take over the government and disable its ability to prevent their operating in corrosive and predatory ways js why aren t more people up in arms mh they re only up in arms if they believe that there is an alternative as long as the vested interests can suppress any idea that there is an alternative that matters don t have to be this way people just get depressed in our third interview you spoke about socrates and the stoics producing a philosophy of lamentation and resignation by his day there seemed no solution except to denounce wealth when matters got much worse in the roman empire wealth was abhorred that became the message of christianity what is needed is to define the scope of the alternative that you want how can the economy grow when households business and government have to pay more and more of their revenue to the financial sector which then turns around and lends its interest and related income out to indebt the economy even more the effect is to extract even more income rising government debt and tax cuts for the rentiers lead to the privatization of public infrastructure and natural monopolies higher prices are charged for tolls to pay for public healthcare education roads and other services that were expected to be provided for free a century ago financialized privatization thus creates a high rent high cost economy the opposite of industrial capitalism evolving into socialism to finally free society from rentier income js wouldn t that be based on the insatiable desire for money and the super rich oligarchs in book 8 of plato s republic so we get back to my question is the behavior of the super rich a constant in human nature mh money love has always been extreme because wealth is addictive but their dynamic of credit other peoples debts increasing at compound interest is mathematized and the economy is put on automatic pilot to self destruct its business plan to create wealth by making financial gains at somebody else s expense without limit this kind of financial wealth is a zero sum activity the wealth of the creditor class the one percent is achieved by indebting the 99 percent js why is it a zero sum activity mh a zero sum activity is when one party s gain is another s loss instead of income paid to creditors being reinvested in means of production to help the economy grow it s spent on buying more assets the most wasteful examples are corporate stock buyback programs and financial raids and the largest effect of financialization occurs as loans and quantitative easing simply bid up the price of real estate stocks bonds and other assets the effect is to put housing and a retirement income further out of range of people who have to live by working for wages and salaries instead of living off absentee ownership interest and financial asset price gains js why is this being done instead of investing in the economy to help the population live a better and more prosperous life mh the tax and regulatory system is set up to make financial gains or create monopoly privileges that is quicker and more certain especially in an economy shrinking as a result of financialization and the austerity it imposes it s hard to make profits by investing in a shrinking economy suffering from debt deflation and a squeeze on family budgets to pay for health care education and other basic needs js so it becomes more about extraction let s come back to global climate change and rising sea levels as a foundation of american foreign policy mh since the 19th century american policy has been based on the recognition that gdp growth reflects rising energy use per capita rising productivity is almost identical with the curve of energy use per worker that was the basic premise of e peshine smith in 1853 and subsequent writers whom i describe in america s protectionist takeoff 1918 1914 the policy conclusion is that if you can control the source of energy which remains mainly oil and coal then you can control global gdp growth that is why dick cheney invaded iraq to grab its oil it is why trump announced his intention to topple venezuela and take its oil if other nations are obliged to buy their oil from the united states or its companies then it s in a monopoly position to turn off their electricity like the united states did to venezuela and hurt their economies if they don t acquiesce in a world system that lets american financial firms come in and buy out their most productive monopolies and privatize theirpublic domain that s why america s foreign policy is to monopolize the world s oil gas and coal in order to have a stranglehold on the rate of growth of other countries by being able to deny them energy it s like denying countries food in order to starve them out the aim isto exploit europe asia africa and latin america what rome exploited its empire js would you be comfortable using words like evil to describe what s going on now mh evil essentially is predatory and destructive behavior socrates said that it ultimately is ignorance because nobody would set out intentionally to do it but in that case evil would be an educational system that imposes ignorance and tunnel vision distracting attention from understanding how economic society actually works in destructive ways on that logic post classical neoliberal economics and the chicago boys are evil because their ideology breeds ignorance and leads its believers to act in ways that are injurious to society preventing personal fulfillment through economic growth evil is a policy that makes most of society poorer simply in order to enrich an increasingly wealth addictive rentier layer at the top werner sombart described the bourgeoisie as floating like a globules of fat on top of a soup js this is now happening on a path that follows an exponential extreme i guess global warming makes it particularly evil we re not simply talking about taking advantage of other people within a society we re talking about destruction of the planet and its environment mh economists dismiss this as an externality that is outside the scope of their models so these models are deliberately ignorant you could say that this makes them evil js that is what i ve suspected since we started the iraq war in 2003 mh america s military buildup its anti environmental policy and global wars are part of the same symbiotic strategy the reason why america will not be part of a real effort to mitigate global warming is that its policy is still based on grabbing the oil resources of the near east venezuela and everywhere else that it can also the oil industry is the most tax exempt and politically powerful sector if it also happens to be the primary cause of global warming that is viewed as just collateral damage to america s attempt to control the world by controlling the oil supply in that sense the environmental impasse is a byproduct of american imperialism js what s hopeful in the united states right now what is a possible good outcome mh t he precondition would be for people to realize that there is an alternative starting with wiping out of student debts they can realize that the overall debt overhead can be wiped out without hurting the economy and indeed rescuing it from the financial rentier class inasmuch as all debts on the liabilities side of the balance sheet have their counterpart on the asset side as the savings of today s financial oligarchy which is doing to the u s economy what rome s senate did to the ancient world js how can people proceed from here mh understanding must come first once you have to have a sense of history you realize that there is an alternative you also see what happens when a creditor oligarchy gets strong enough to prevent any public power from writing down debts and to prevent attempts to tax it you have to do to america today what the republicans did after the civil war you have to have a new university curriculum dealing with economic history the history of economic thought and the real world s long term development js and what would be the premise for such economic history mh t he starting point is to realize that civilization began in the ancient near east and made a turn to oppose a strong public regulatory sector in classical greece and rome the long term tension is the eternal fight by the oligarchy of creditors and large land owners to reduce the rest of society to serfdom and to oppose strong rulers empowered to act in the economy s long term interest by creating checks against this polarization js so how much longer does this go on for months for years for decades mh it always goes on longer than you think it will inertia has a great elastic self reinforcing power polarization will widen until people believe that there is an alternative and decide to fight for it two things are required for this to happen first a large proportion of people need to see that the economy is impoverishing them and that the existing picture of what is happening is misleading instead of wealth trickling down it is defying gravity and sucking income up from the base of the economic pyramid people are having to work harder just to stay in place until their life style breaks down second people must realize that it doesn t have to be this way there isan alternative js right now most people think that government regulation and progressive taxation will make things worse and that the wealthy are job creators not job destroyers they think that the system needs to be bolstered not replaced because the alternative is socialism that is what the soviets did not what franklin roosevelt was doing but today bailing out the banks and giving subsidies to new employers is said to be for our own good mh that s what the romans told their provinces everything they did was always to preserve good order meaning open opportunities for their own wealth grabbing they never said they were out to destroy and loot other societies madeline albright followed this rhetorical pattern in describing as being like the romans and france s brutal mission civilisatrice a program to uplift the world free market efficiency for performing this service the imperial power takes all the money that its colonies provinces and allies can generate that s why the u s meddles in foreign politics as we have just seen in ukraine libya and syria js you ve described the greatest meddling as distorting the narrative of history to depict creditor and rentier drives toward oligarchy as being democratic and helping to raise living standards and culture your books show just the opposite mh

the one silver lining in the nomination of political hack steve moore to the federal reserve is that it might spur a productive discussion on the benefits or lack of them of monetary policy as an instrument of economic growth this is principally because it s just one ingredient for what is necessary to instill economic growth and not a particularly good one at that a more direct approach is via appropriately targeted and sufficiently large fiscal actions in regard to monetary policy low interest rates kept in place for a long time can actually constrain economic growth unless they are coupled with sensible compensating fiscal policy due to the adverse income impact to savers emanating from a resultant lower income stream there is also a problem of political legitimacy when so little of the funding is explicitly approved by congress and is left instead to the discretion creation of the federal reserve which has historically tended to prioritize the narrow interests of finance over the rest of the economy and steve moore a leading advocate of cutting rates to promote additional economic growth even as he has historically championed spending cuts will simply perpetuate the unfortunately widely held notion of monetary policy as an effective cure all if his ideas gain policy traction within the powell led federal reserve in fact what is truly required is well formulated fiscal policy and less monetary policy activism precisely the opposite of today s prevailing trends solvency per se is not the issue the key here is howthe money is spent lest fiscal policy become as diffuse in its effects as monetary policy has become as well as discredited politically because of perceived ineffectiveness when long standing structural issues such as inequality remain unaddressed moore a heritage foundation fellow and former wall street journal editorial board member has called for the federal reserve to cut rates in order to spur faltering economic growth here s the problem interest rates are a diffuse tool to manage economic growth for every distressed borrower who benefits from lower interest rate charges there is a saver adversely affected by the resultant loss of income additionally as bloomberg columnist noah smith argues cheap credit does a poor job of weeding out zombie companies that compete for scarce resources in fact a case can be made that low rates actually exacerbate prevailing deflationary trends low rates lower investment threshold returns and reduce the costs of holding inventory both of which can create oversupply as well as perpetuating asset bubbles a highly toxic combination that prevails in the united states indeed globally today even with lower unemployment the u s economy is largely characterized by middling growth spread too thin and too inequitably moore s policy prescriptions would likely make things worse low interest rate regimes have also helped to promote reckless financial engineering that has enabled corporate ceos and their trusty investment bankers to inflate profits and sustain company share prices as high as possible often at a cost of ignoring the strategic long term planning required to handle global competitive challenges from overseas companies that are slowly eating our proverbial lunch in essence therefore lax monetary policy has become the handmaiden of the speculation economy in general the fed s obsession with interest rates and bond yields along with the corresponding shape of the yield curve has obscured the manner in which such rates have provided a low cost laboratory for the creation of frankenstein like instruments of financial mass destruction furthermore as professors l randall wray and scott fullwiler have argued this was made even worse by the fed s cultivation of a belief that no matter what goes wrong the fed would never allow a too big to fail institution to suffer from excessively risky practice if anything this encouraged more risk taking the real paradox of using monetary policy in general is that it only works to the extent that it induces the private sector to spend more out of current income or encourages binging on private debt which low rates can facilitate if current income is adversely impacted by weak income flows however the interest rate is a highly flawed tool to solve the underlying problem especially if it means simplistically cutting rates further as moore advocates such an action can foment bubbles in a multitude of assets stocks and real estate being two of the most prominent examples the collapse of which ultimately creates greater deflation as well as exacerbating income inequality this is because asset bubbles create huge increases in income for top earners particularly in the finance sector due to the relentless expansion of credit brought about by prevailing low rates changes in technology and increasingly poor and outdated regulation in the context of a rapidly globalized financial system have accelerated a trend of asset growth and accumulation increasingly being funneled into fewer and fewer hands at the top when asset bubbles burst the economically distressed sell to those with higher prevailing cash balances setting the stage for further increases in inequality during the subsequent cycle as the post 2008 environment clearly has done as a new economics foundation report argues the process is self reinforcing because increasing wealth accrues both higher income returns and greater political power this means that those with the highest amount of wealth have the means to lobby governments to maintain status quo policy structures that perpetuate inequality cutting rates at this juncture simply perpetuates current bubble like conditions and therefore will make the ultimate outcome worse when the bubble inevitably bursts moore s policy prescription of cutting rates is therefore akin to giving a junkie another shot of heroin rather than dealing with the underlying addiction itself moreover the single minded focus on interest rate levels has per fullwiler and wray diverted the federal reserve s attention away from its responsibility to regulate and supervise the financial sector and its mandate to keep unemployment low its shift of priorities contributed to the creation of those conditions that led to crisis by contrast fiscal policy can also deal more effectively with the pathology of inequality via targeted spending which can impact distributional outcomes as it means directing funds toward those with the highest spending propensities as opposed to the 1 percent who generally save more of their income which means less bang for the fiscal buck contrary to prevailing neoliberal theology economic redistribution in such circumstances actually enhances an economy s growth potential rather than hindering it but we also want to avoid the fiscal zombie mindset as well the key is ensuring that deficits are used toward productive job creation not a perpetuation of crony capitalism all too often fiscal policy has been used in service of the latter this means it has become somewhat politically discredited as an instrument of policy by both parties in the first instance back in 2009 because the initial fiscal rescue package was insufficiently robust given the loss of almost 2 trillion in economic output in the united states alone then president obama s 700bn stimulus package while helpful mostly kept the recession from being far worse rather than enabling a significant economic recovery which later led to republican charges that the policy was ineffective by contrast on the monetary policy front financial institutions received commitments from the federal reserve that may have been as high as 29 trillion according to a report from the levy institute more recently the benefits of trump s highly touted tax reform have proven to be more apparent than real the whole premise behind the lower corporate tax rate was that it would result in literally trillions of dollars allegedly parked offshore being repatriated back to the united states resulting in a surge of job creation however as financial writer alex kimani has illustrated corporate america brought back just 664 9 billion of offshore profits or just 16 6 percent of the 4 trillion trump said they would return as a result of the tax overhaul in reality even kimani s analysis overstates the case there has been no massive dollar repatriation as such these dollars have always remained deposited in u s bank accounts but have simply been classified as offshore via accounting legerdemain in order to exploit lower corporate rates abroad as yves smith of naked capitalism points out apple managed to get a special deal with ireland that allowed it to report corporate profits nowhere for tax purposes kept the cash related to its irish sub in banks in the us and managed it out of an internal hedge fund in arizona given the prevailing deficit phobia that afflicts both political parties depending on which is in power this kind of gimmickry with minimal benefits being experienced by the bulk of the population has legitimized a political narrative against additional fiscal spending on the grounds that it didn t do what it promised to do and placed the united states closer to national bankruptcy while it is true that government that creates and issues its own currency can never run out of money a policy that ignores howfunds are spent can easily produce undesirable outcomes such as inflation or rising inequality one of the great post keynesian economists of the 20th century hyman minsky insisted in the words of one of his students l randall wray that the impact of the budget on the economy depends on where spending and taxing is directed military spending and transfers for example are less productive and therefore more inflationary and yet this is precisely where much of trump s new spending is being directed even as vital social spending is being cut back unfortunately this has led opposition to trump to fall into the intellectual cul de sac of obsessing about debts and deficits rather than focusing on what we do with those deficits and as the paltry benefits of last year s tax package have largely dissipated to the extent that they created any economic benefit at all for the bulk of americans the focus has come back to the federal reserve just as steve moore s nomination has been announced a decade on from the collapse of the 2008 bubble the latest data on inflation shows an invidious combination consumer price index figures are now rising at their lowest level in almost two years but virtually all core inflation reports rana foroohar from the financial times was in rent or the owner s equivalent of rent up 0 3 per cent core goods inflation meanwhile was down 0 2 per cent this means higher house prices at a time when quality affordable housing is still out of reach for the average american lowering interest rates as moore suggests will likely exacerbate the housing bubble and fuel additional stock market speculation without fundamentally doing much to promote further spending power on the part of the average american citizen meanwhile the relative absence of a proper role for fiscal policy means that the toxic prevailing macroeconomic imbalances such as ongoing huge levels of household indebtedness and wealth inequality will continue every tool and target deployed by the federal reserve has simply restored an unhealthy status quo ante in financial speculation while the comparative diminution of fiscal policy has left us with an inefficient economy that still leaves tens of millions of workers behind in terms of wage gains access to decent public infrastructure and denial of quality health care imagine if some of those trillions of government loan guarantees standing credit facilities and bailouts to various financial institutions had gone toward more productive uses how much better would the u s economy look today regrets aside it s becoming increasingly difficult to make the case that cutting interest rates alone is a panacea in fact in the current context it may well make things worse

published by ux consulting company llc uxc overall performance the net gain for the year ended february 28 2019 was mainly driven by unrealized net gains on investments in uranium of 174 201 000 and income from uranium relocation agreements of 541 000 offset by operating expenses of 4 090 000 2018 net loss due to unrealized net losses on investments in uranium of 29 368 000 realized losses on the sale of conversion components of 4 079 000 and operating expenses of 4 038 000 slightly offset by income from uranium relocation agreements of 224 000 unrealized net gains on investments in uranium during the year ended february 28 2019 were mainly due to the increase in the spot price for uranium the spot prices during the fiscal year increased from us 21 25 per pound u 3 o 8 and us 62 00 per kgu as uf 6 at february 28 2018 to us 28 00 per pound u 3 o 8 and us 87 00 per kgu as uf 6 at february 28 2019 the unrealized net gain on investments in uranium was also positively impacted by a 3 increase in the u s dollar to canadian dollar exchange rate during fiscal 2019 unrealized net losses on investments in uranium during the year ended february 28 2018 were mainly due to the decrease in spot prices from us 22 25 per pound u 3 o 8 and us 64 00 per kgu as uf 6 at february 28 2017 to us 21 25 per pound u 3 o 8 and us 62 00 per kgu as uf 6 at february 28 2018 the unrealized net loss on

recorded an unrealized net loss on investments in uranium of 30 577 000 and a net loss for the period of 32 171 000 the unrealized net loss on investments in uranium was predominantly driven by the decrease in the spot price of uranium from us 29 10 per pound u 3 o 8 and us 89 25 per kgu as uf 6 at november 30 2018 to us 28 00 and us 87 00 respectively at february 28 2019 the unrealized net loss

february 28 2019 from 463 329 000 at february 28 2018 the increase in equity was due to the net proceeds of the company s 23 009 200 equity financing which resulted in the issuance of 5 612 000 common shares as well as the net gain for the year the corporation had an effective tax rate of nil for the years ended february 28 2019 and february 28 2018 primarily due to the corporation s available tax shelter giving rise to a net deductible temporary difference for which the corporation does not recognize deferred tax assets taken together upc s nav per share increased to 4 75 at february 28 2019 from 3 50 at february 28 2018 current market conditions aftershocks echoing throughout the nuclear fuel industry from the 2011 fukushima daichii nuclear incident which led to the multi year shutdown of all nuclear power generation in japan have produced several years of challenging market conditions in fiscal 2019 however several significant industry events have helped set the stage for sustained positive change in future years stability and a rising uranium price is a welcome change for the nuclear fuel industry which has been plagued by volatility and a sustained multi year decline in both the spot price and long term contract price of uranium during fiscal 2019 the uranium price declined from approximately us 21 25 per pound u 3 o 8 at the beginning of the year to an intra year low of us 20 50 per pound u 3 o 8 in april 2018 before strengthening and climbing steadily through the balance of the fiscal year to end the 2019 fiscal year at us 28 00 per pound u 3 o 8 the recent strength in the market has been supported in part by a number of events on the supply side most significant of these events was cameco corp s cameco announcement that the temporary shutdown of the mcarthur river mine would become indefinite with the timing of a restart dependent on future contracting and market conditions tied to this statement was cameco s confirmation of its continued commitment to meeting existing customer obligations by purchasing large volumes of uranium in the spot market national atomic company kazatomprom kazatomprom added to this supply side shift by keeping its promise to curtail its own production resulting in a 20 reduction from previously planned production levels kazatomprom also indicated that they will maintain this reduced level of production in calendar years 2019 and 2020 other curtailment efforts have also occurred including paladin energy ltd placing its langer heinrich operation in namibia on care and maintenance the primary production landscape changed further with the decision by rio tinto to sell its 68 2 share in the rössing operation in namibia to china national uranium corporation this sale does not create a fundamental change to supply and demand in the near term but it does likely mean that rössing production which had been a staple of western utilities for decades will now likely be destined for chinese consumption going forward according to the world nuclear association wna as at the end of the 2019 fiscal year there are 445 nuclear reactors operable in 30 countries these reactors can generate almost 396 gigawatts of electricity gwe which equates to approximately 10 of the world s electrical requirements and 21 of electrical requirements in organisation for economic co operation and development oecd member countries as at february 28 2019 are also 57 nuclear reactors under construction in 15 countries with the principal drivers of this expansion being china 13 reactors under construction india 7 russia 6 south korea 5 uae 4 and the united states 4 in addition there are another 126 reactors currently being planned around the world importantly in february 2019 the chinese government announced after a brief hiatus in the approval of new reactor projects in that country the preliminary approval for the construction of four new domestically designed hpr1000 reactors according to uxc s q1 2019 uranium market outlook q1 2019 outlook global nuclear power capacities are projected to increase to 462 reactors generating approximately 453 gwe in 35 countries by 2035 in the q1 2019 outlook uxc estimates base case demand in 2019 to be 195 million pounds u 3 o 8 uxc also estimates that annual uranium demand could grow to 210 million pounds u 3 o 8 under their base case for 2035 and to more than 290 million pounds u 3 o 8 in their high case for the same period the japan story remains a slow moving one but generally positive japan s restart effort continues to advance with the country finally beginning to make meaningful progress in bringing its nuclear fleet back online in fiscal 2019 japan increased its total number of nuclear reactors in operation to nine proving that there is a path to restart in the country perhaps more important was the fact that while japan has struggled with timely restarts over the past eight years the global nuclear energy industry has continued to advance and has now grown such that the current level of global nuclear power generation has recovered to the pre fukushima levels from this point forward additional japanese restarts can be seen as an added bonus to global nuclear generation the steady price rise in fiscal 2019 can also be attributed to the high volume of uranium transacted in the spot market in calendar year 2018 spot market volumes set a record exceeding 88 million pounds u 3 o 8 and surpassing the previously recorded high of 56 million pounds u 3 o 8 in 2011 while certain nuclear utilities looked to take advantage of low priced uranium available in the market the increase in transaction volume was mostly fueled by producer and trader buying resulting from production cutbacks as well as renewed interest from financial investors speculating in the physical market while spot market volumes exceeded expectations long term contracting in the market continued to lag market participants have entered into long term contracts for less than 400 million pounds of u 3 o 8 over the past five years a period in which consumption exceeded 800 million pounds u 3 o 8 while uncertainty surrounding fukushima has started to fade and signposts suggesting that buyers are planning to begin long term contracting have emerged a section 232 trade petition in the united states has brought renewed uncertainty to the market over the last several months the petition was submitted to the us department of commerce doc at the end of fiscal 2018 by us uranium producers energy fuels inc and ur energy inc requesting that the doc investigate whether uranium imports into the united states are detrimental to that country s national security uncertainty from the section 232 trade petition has gradually increased as we approach the conclusion of the doc investigation the companies who introduced the trade petition proposed a 25 domestic purchase quota for us utilities as a potential remedy however the doc has the discretion to propose any remedy that it may consider appropriate ahead of a final decision by the us president as to the implementation of any trade measure it is expected that the findings of the doc as well as an ultimate decision by the us president on whether a remedy will be imposed and what it will look like could be announced as early as the second calendar quarter of 2019 the overhang created by this potential trade action has had a direct impact on utility procurement especially those based in the us causing them to retreat from the market until the impact of the petition is better understood this slowed purchasing led uxc to revise its projections in its q1 2019 outlook such that cumulative uncovered nuclear utility requirements are now 1 6 billion pounds of u 3 o 8 through 2035 other important demand side events in fiscal 2019 have contributed to shifting market sentiment including positive news from some of the world s leading economies in november france released its anticipated energy plan answering questions that had emerged regarding potential plans by the country to reduce its reliance on nuclear energy under the new energy plan france upheld its goal introduced by previous french president hollande to reduce its reliance on nuclear energy to 50 but extended the time frame for this change by a decade from 2025 to 2035 this was seen as a considerable win for nuclear energy both in france and globally closely following the news from france was an announcement by the european commission that it will adopt a long term climate plan that calls for the european union to become the first major climate neutral economy by 2050 the plan focuses heavily on the energy sector stating that renewables and nuclear power will be the backbone of a carbon free european power system as well china continued building on its existing reactor portfolio by starting seven new reactors in fiscal 2019 adding to this accomplishment china became the first to commercially operate two new reactor designs westinghouse electric company s ap1000 and france s epr completion of these new designs was a positive signal to the industry that the designs work and will aid deployment of these reactor designs in other jurisdictions subsequent event effective april 1 2019 the corporation entered into a new management services agreement with the manager the msa the management fee structure in the 2019 msa is unchanged from the 2016 msa with the manager being entitled to the following a a base fee of 400 000 per annum payable in equal quarterly installments b

powerful unions joined up with small business owners and activists to march through buenos aires on thursday to protest argentinian president mauricio macri s austerity measures according to al jazeera many of those marching were calling for a coalition of forces to continue challenging marcri s government just six months before the next major election recession hit argentina has been enduring a period of unrest after macri s government said it was determined to reach a zero fiscal deficit as part of a 56 billion bailout agreement made last year with the international monetary fund thousands came out despite the rainy weather in the capital with protesters marching along the road and organizations carrying colorful banners and drums to gather attention to their demands including calls for better salaries and decent work the protest marched from downtown to congress before intense storms moved into the city but the marchers were able to stop a major highway at one point to mark their anger at marcri the center right leader has been pushing austerity measures for argentina to meet the imf goal stated in the imf bailout agreement but steep inflation has hit many people across the latin american country the reforms have also included subsidy cuts that have led to rising utility rates we cannot afford to pay for the electricity or the gas before people in my neighborhood used to do small jobs like gardening but now that s gone because the middle class is collapsing the increases are also affecting them said 55 year old blanca carmona as she marched to afp osvaldo cornide head of the argentine confederation of small and medium sized businesses said many people were being forced to close their businesses or fire their workers along with suffering a lethal and perverse combination of unpayable tariffs an internal market destroyed as a result of wages lost day after day through inflation massive dismissals that remove people from the market as consumers indiscriminate opening up to imports deranged interest rates and unviable tax pressure argentina has been weighed down with high interests rates combined with a weak peso and inflation currently at an annual rate of more than 50 percent macri s government says the spending reduction and increased taxes are simply what s necessary to re balance the economy but with more than a third of argentines currently living below the poverty line many are losing their patience with the painful measures wn com maureen foody
market reform has been china s flagship economic initiative for over 40 years yet each new round of reform often ends up with more heavy handed state control why does china s market reform so often backslide why is government intervention a persistent syndrome even after the center repeatedly promised to give the market a decisive role in resource allocation with the state playing a central role in coordinating economic activities the chinese government builds and sustains the market but falls short on empowering it while building functional markets requires state facilitation china s state led market reform hinders the establishment of healthy market selection and adjustment mechanisms business performance is dependent more on riding the policy wave than prudent management or innovative business models subdued by political objectives the alleged market economy with chinese characteristics encounters various challenges both in terms of the macroeconomy and sector specific reforms a seesaw economy the policy shift in mid 2018 from market reform to growth stabilization belies a recurrent pattern of a policy induced business cycle which the leading liberal economist wu jinglian described as the seesaw economy growth has been created by massive state led investments leaving an indebted risk filled economy but contractionary side effects from deleveraging motivate a return to economic expansion starting in late 2017 the state embarked on supply side structural reform to make china s growth model more normal and sustainable by giving the market a greater role in resource allocation the rationale behind this move according to huang yiping a professor of economics at peking university national school of development is that china s economic success is based on an open goods market and controlled production factors labor land capital etc to rebalance the economy adds huang the state must tolerate slower growth improve income distribution upgrade industry structure and gradually free up production factors yet the reform campaign did not pan out ironically the market restructuring effort was executed with one size fits all administrative measures due to political pressure on officials at various levels the central government distributed production capacity and debt reduction targets to provinces which were then vertically allocated to cities and counties directives restrictions and quotas rather than market led rebalancing are preferred by local officials to achieve political key performance indicators this leads to policy overimplementation coupled with trade conflicts with the united states china s exports and domestic investment stalled and the state decided to stage a new expansionary cycle in mid 2018 keynesian style government investment became the most effective painkiller for economic slowdown since 2008 and this time is no different politically motivated local governments and state owned enterprises soes launched infrastructure projects with cheap credit from state owned banks politburo economic meetings in four consecutive quarters in 2018 saw mounting concerns over the economic slowdown and rising support for expansion the march 2019 session of the national people s congress approved a 0 2 percentage point raise in the fiscal deficit reaching 2 8 percent the local special purpose revenue bond quota saw an 800 billion renminbi 119 billion increase active fiscal policies will support infrastructure construction in transportation logistics next generation internet and urban facilities the most worrisome aspect of infrastructure expansion is local government solvency despite the state s reassurance that investment will be targeted and mild previous rounds of stimulus already strained local coffers while disclosed government balance sheets look healthy the state is vague about implicit debt figures which are believed to be much larger than explicit liabilities disciplining illicit local borrowing made progress in 2018 officials are held accountable for increasing unpermitted debt but it remains in question whether the approved fiscal enhancement is sufficient for local infrastructure expansion and if not how localities should balance between growth targets and borrowing restrictions meanwhile lowering the gdp growth target to 6 0 6 5 percent does not mean the goal is easier to achieve it is now much costlier to generate growth as investment needed for one additional unit of gdp has grown from 3 5 in 2007 to 6 3 in 2016 according to huang yiping as such local malpractice may still occur to ensure targets are hit dual track market reform struggle vested interests and rent seeking lead to inconsistent and often times contradictory state management of sector specific reforms through the dual track system as china took a gradualist approach in the transition from planned to market economy it set up a new track for marketization in parallel with the planned track hoping that the two will eventually merge together however balancing the market and planned tracks is tricky interest groups representing monopolistic state owned sectors can balk at the reform agenda illicit practices in new markets normally abound before rules could be established arbitrage between the two tracks often benefits actors with privileged access to political resources in promoting market reform the state often faces a similar dilemma as for the macroeconomy should it choose stability or reform after a market is established and operational the state pulls out of the market only to find a surge of malpractices that destabilize market orders when the state weighs back in market actors lose their vitality and start speculating on policy loopholes or acquiring subsidies market selection and price signals are largely ineffective this pattern is widespread across various industries undergoing the dual track transition including electricity healthcare and more china s healthcare marketization for example is marked by both market and state failures since the start of reform in 1985 public hospitals became de facto for profit market entities as they were encouraged to take responsibility for their own financial sustainability the dual track system generated incentives to provide care services by allowing hospitals to monopolize drug sales at 15 percent markups and compensating practitioners for over prescription of drugs and lucrative testing in addition to distorting financial incentives the policy introduced managerial inefficiencies that inflate costs and retard quality improvement with misaligned market signals these drug addicted hospitals are blamed for pushing up healthcare costs harming public health and driving local health insurance funds to the brink state led efforts to restore market mechanisms have been disappointing in the 1990s a 30 percent cap on prescription drug revenue as a ratio of total income was introduced as a way to curb excessive drug spending for patients after initial pilots the policy was rolled out nationwide and recognized as the primary indicator for hospital performance in 2009 this too failed to yield satisfactory results as profit seeking public hospitals gamed the system to increase non prescription income by dodging high quality drug prescriptions duplicating tests and examinations or opting for complicated surgeries the drug sales cap failed to shake up the strong pro markup lobbying group of public hospitals and pharmaceutical companies a second wave of state intervention began in 2015 after several unsuccessful attempts to separate drug sales from monopolistic interests in 2017 the two invoice system superseded markups in the pharmaceutical procurement supply chain to restrict public hospital funding sources to medical services and state subsidies only in january 2019 the state council proposed new performance criteria to evaluate third tier public hospitals which replaced drug sale caps with requirements on rational prescribing and dosage nevertheless incentives are still misaligned with the public good making up funding losses will be hard for hospitals especially those lower level ones that rely even more on drug sales patients may see surging service charges for fewer drug prescriptions the goal to ensure fairness profitability and effectiveness in public care providers is hardly achieved not to mention cleaning up the bloated ineffective and opaque pharmaceutical supply chain competition policy for a level playing field the root cause of unempowered markets in china is the unlevel playing field between state and private actors this makes competition policy a potential breakthrough for market reform there are three defense lines against market failures according to wei jianing of the state council development research center corporate ethics and self restraint market punishment to drive out unethical firms and government intervention the first two channels are ineffective in china because of education failures the lack of a social credit system and an uneven playing field being the last resort action however state intervention should not replace the market it should eliminate obstacles to a functional market system and foster fair competition environment argues wei discontent over an unfair competition environment instigated public criticism over private businesses financing difficulties in mid 2018 when the early signals of the slowdown began to manifest financial repression and credit rationing make access to cheap credit a valuable resource in itself most of which flows to local governments and state owned enterprises private firms without political connections are unable to get bank loans not to mention borrowing at a cheap interest rate the disadvantage was painfully felt as growth prospects stalled policymakers from people s bank of china governor yi gang to president xi jinping came out to reassure the market and pledged upcoming support this was then achieved through frequent policy directives that urge banks to extend more credit to private small firms again market principles were not at work even with the political mobilization to save the private economy the delivery of such support is easier said than done there are concerns that expanded bank credit may either balloon the real estate bubble or add to banks non performing loans the safest bet for banks is to lend to private firms operating in areas in line with national strategies it s politics stupid incomplete market reform is a symptom of conflicting goals between improving the economic system and political reality market reform is more of a means to achieve political and social stability rather than an end in itself with institutional constraints china often faces catch 22 situations in market empowerment state control and protection distort resource allocation and prevent the market from establishing independent operational rules efforts to redress these problems destabilize existing economic order and government intervention is restored to smooth out the turbulence top down bureaucratic structure too can be an obstacle to market reform people s bank of china pboc research bureau director xu zhong pointed out that bureau chiefs charged with steering the drafting process lack authority to resolve conflicting agency interests consequently final documents skirt around contentious issues and fail to address tough issues or practical challenges besides problematic policy formulation local officials are often more responsive to superior directives than resolving long term trouble a strong central preference for either reform or business as usual leads to local overimplementation one way or the other but centrism baffles local officials this poses a great challenge for effective policy transmission in his great transformation karl polanyi explained how markets are not completely free and self regulated systems however the root cause for unempowered markets in china is overuse of state power which obstructs reform agendas as the market mechanism remained underdeveloped the long term solution of thorough institutional reform is far from the horizon given the persistent vicious cycle of failed market regulatory autonomy and ensuing government intervention zhizhen lu is a china macroeconomy analyst at a

overview comments by chinese president xi recognizing substantial progress in trade helped boost sentiment after the us china negotiators failed to set a date for the meeting between the two presidents although we have argued that the german economy may be past the worst the sharp drop in factory orders spooked investors however today s stronger than expected industrial output data lifted by construction lends credence to ideas that the external sector is the chief weight as the auto industry continues to work through its idiosyncratic challenges us and canada s job reports area the highlight ahead of the weekend china taiwan and hong kong markets are closed today but most asia pacific markets edged higher though australian stocks continued to underperform and today s 0 8 loss leaves it flat for the week european shares are a little higher to close in on a 2 4 gain for the week core bond yields are one to two basis points higher which is enough to put the benchmark german bund back slightly above zero asia pacific reports had played up the likelihood that a date for the meeting between xi and trump would be announced as early as yesterday a meeting date is only seen possible if an agreement has been struck and the two presidents need to sign off this may seem unremarkable but it is a concession to china which wants to avoid the risk that trump walks out as he did in north korea trump has seemed to want to leave some things open for xi and him to resolve xi s comments came after trump said the deal which had not been agreed to would be very monumental no date has been set and now reports suggest it may still take several weeks to get it down on paper while we have been on the leading edge of the green shoots camp we see japan as an exception japan justified our concern earlier today with weak income and spending data household spending slowed in february to 1 7 from 2 0 in january it was softer than economists expected the fuel for consumption is wealth and income income figures were poor labor cash income shocked with a 0 8 loss economists had expected a 0 9 gain after a 1 2 increase year over year in january in real terms it fell 1 1 after having risen by 1 1 in january the australian dollar is firm trading near the highs it has been bumping against this week near 0 7130 putting it up about 0 4 for the week there is a large option for a 1 7 bln struck at 0 7100 that expires today that makes the aussie the strongest of the majors this week volatility often injected by the us jobs report the yen on the other hand is among the weakest of the majors losing about 0 7 the dollar has set a higher high against the yen every day this week after finishing last week near jpy110 85 it is in a ten tick range on either side of jpy111 70 today the relevant expiring options are struck at jpy111 50 520 mln and jpy112 00 885 mln europe germany industrial output did not just rise 0 7 in february exceeding market expectations for a 0 5 increase prior to yesterday s surprisingly weak factory orders but the 0 8 decline in january was revised away a hint may have been provided yesterday with german construction pmi the construction sector is including in industrial output in germany the pmi rose to 55 6 in march from 54 7 in february and 50 7 in january industrial production was lifted by a 6 8 rise in construction manufacturing is still weak and eased 0 2 which is the fifth decline in the past six months judging from the retail sales and recent ifo survey and today s report it appears that the german domestic economy is doing better but the external sector remains an important headwind spain was not as fortunate industrial output slid 1 1 in february after a 3 6 gain in january prime minister may has formally requested a delay in brexit to the end of june this may prove to be a bit difficult the uk idea seems to be that as long as it leaves before the selection of the next european commission it ought not to be required to participate in the eu parliament elections at the end of next month however the ec s instructions were to accept the withdrawal agreement and get a short extension to pass the necessary legislation leave without an agreement at the end of next week or seek a longer delay there seemed to be two important developments this week the house of commons instructed may to seek a delay to block a no deal exit may arguably belatedly has begun talks with labour the main opposition party however it is still not clear how may is going to play her hand she could seek to work with the two dozen or so labour mps who mostly come from leave districts or she could try to cut a deal with corbyn the euro has been confined to yesterday s ranges which were inside wednesday s range or roughly 1 1200 1 1250 maturing options are struck at that range today 870 mln euros at 1 12 and 2 2 bln euros at 1 1250 it closed last week a little below 1 1220 the intraday technicals seem to allow for another attempt on the upper end of the range but it may prove to be a better sale on a bounce sterling is slightly firmer on the week it finished last week near 1 3035 and is now closer to 1 3075 there is an option for almost gbp220 mln struck at 1 31 that will be cut today it reached a high near 1 33 this week it had tested and held 1 30 america the us jobs data is front and center there are not many inputs economists can draw on for their forecasts the adp is off step with a strong february estimate that was revised up and the softer march report the ism manufacturing employment rose the weekly jobless claims eased during the survey period and last week fell to 50 year lows suggesting momentum there are practically no other indicators suggesting that the february jow growth a miserly 20k was an accurate reflection of the economy we note the stability of the us jobs growth averaging 186k over 3 mo 190k over 6 209k over 12 and 199k over 24 months other elements of the report are also important for market participants due to the base effect hourly earnings need to rise by about 0 3 to maintain the year over year pace of 3 4 it is also possible that the workweek increased from 34 4 hours to 34 5 hours the unemployment rate is expected to be steady at 3 8 a second poor report would likely weigh on the dollar with the yen a major beneficiary as risk would have to come off stocks down bonds up president trump confirmed reports that he will nominate cain to the federal reserve board of governors this nomination like moore s is being bet with derision may many economists both are in favor of easier money thought cain has been a fan of a return to the gold standard it is recognized that governments often want to influence monetary policy as practices have evolved the power to do so has become more constrained as the independence of the central bank became more necessary to investors the power of appointment is the preferred way while the economic profession wants monetary policy to be handled by its guild a monopoly is not necessary more importantly if an executive power of appointment is curbed won t they be likely to return to more direct ways of influencing monetary policy canada reports its march employment data as well the recent string of economic data has been better than expected the february jobs gains were strong january gdp rose 0 3 instead of 0 1 and yesterday s ivey survey jumped to 54 3 from 50 6 in february to return near january s 54 7 reading over the past three months canada has averaged job growth of 43 5k full time 26 3k and a 48 3k average for the past six months full time 29 2k economists anticipate a payback for the heady 55 9k increase in february 67 4k full time in march the median forecast in the bloomberg survey is for a 10k increase in headline job growth with a little more than half coming from full time positions ahead of the job reports the us dollar is trading firm against the canadian dollar near the week s highs cad1 3375 support has been established near cad1 3300 and a close above cad1 34 would lift the tone
berlin reuters german finance minister olaf scholz will urge financial leaders next week to strive for a minimum level of corporate taxation globally and increase debt transparency in developing countries a senior german government official said on friday the talks in washington will be dominated by political risks such as trade disputes and britain s departure from the european union said the government official who spoke on condition of anonymity scholz who is likely to face calls to increase fiscal stimulus to counter the effect of a slowing economy will tell allies that germany s large current account surplus will shrink gradually due to vibrant domestic demand rising real wages and increased state spending the official added this won t happen rapidly this will happen step by step the official said germany expects its current account surplus by far the largest in the world to shrink to the equivalent of 6 8 percent of its economic output next year from 7 3 percent this year finance ministers and central bank governors of the world s 20 biggest economies are due to meet in washington next week with the state of the global economy and political risks to growth at the top of the agenda in a preview of the april 12 14 imf and world bank spring meetings international monetary fund managing director christine lagarde said on tuesday that global growth has lost momentum amid rising trade tensions and tighter financial conditions scholz sees a minimum level of corporate taxation globally as an important step to prevent digital companies such as google facebook and amazon from booking profits in low tax countries rather than where their customers are located the government official said that the talks in washington should bring progress on this front and that scholz hoped for an agreement among the members of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd by mid 2020 scholz is also expected to urge china and other countries to share more information about their lending in other countries to increase debt transparency china has become one of the largest lenders in emerging markets but it is not a member of the paris club of government creditors reporting by michael nienaber editing by thomas seythal and alexander ratz by michael nienaber
u s investors have long looked south to get the most for their real estate dollars and with the u s currency steadily climbing in value latin american countries are looking like an even better bargain adventurous investors who are willing to explore options in emerging countries are likely to see a strong return over time experts said countries that have caught on with tourists but are just starting to see interest from bigger developers like panama and belize offer some of the best bang for the buck said stephanie anton president at luxury portfolio international that list is expanding with destinations in countries like colombia and nicaragua now deemed safe for international travelers and expats more restraint and a cool head key to investing in australia s heritage homes there are also destinations in europe especially those where the local currency is not as strong where u s dollars will go further than they have in the past london for example is more affordable now than it has been in a long time because of uncertainty over brexit and the strength of the dollar doesn t just benefit u s investors many foreign investors especially from the middle east also deal in the currency according to julian walker of spot blue international property which is based in london dollars have been rising on the u s dollar index dxy for the last 15 months as recorded by marketwatch the index uses a scale of 100 to measure the value of the dollar against other world currencies the euro canadian dollar british pound swedish krona swiss franc and japanese yen it s now at about 97 on the index it was at its lowest in 2008 when the great recession caused it to slip to 72 17 on the index since then its highest point was 102 21 in october 2016 more high income americans who aren t prepared for a long term investment should consider renting instead latin america twenty years ago colombia was not on the minds of real estate investors but as peace has begun to settle into the south american country many are discovering its diverse landscape and the beach towns on the caribbean tourism to the south american country is creeping up as it is no longer the danger zone it was in the 1980s and 90s the number of international visitors rose from 0 6 million in 2007 to 4 million in 2017 according to estimates from the un world tourism organization in a 2018 report and increased tourism often leads to investment cities like bogota and medellin are good bets as well as coastal areas like cartagena and santa marta it s kind of like what the dominican republic was in the 90s or costa rica ms anton said i think it s going to be a much bigger story in the coming years more strategies for sellers as chinese buyers scale back on foreign real estate investment a new almost 3 800 square foot condo on the water is priced at 3 8 billion colombian pesos us 1 3 million according to a mansion global listing a u s dollar is worth about 3 145 pesos ms anton did caution that it s early days as the country is recovering from its history of violence and the drug trade it s just emerging as a destination for overseas buyers indeed colombia is for an adventurous investor according to mike cobb ceo of eci development which is working on developments in five latin american countries the best deals are in countries with relatively few amenities mr cobb said those pioneers who invest now will help get the area established thus increasing demand from buyers and developers alike and the original investors will see a healthy return more amazon hq2 reversal proves danger of speculative home buying to that end belize is the next hot spot according to mr cobb whose company is developing the country s first marriott hotel at ambergris caye belize s largest island several other luxury developments are being planned there and the infrastructure is improving with upgraded airports and roads and expanded local transportation options ambergris caye is today where turks caicos was 15 or 20 years ago he explained when you put it in context of the caribbean marketplace it s very affordable the cost to acquire a home and live there is about half the price of doing so in turks caicos he said other caribbean destinations like the cayman islands are about the same he added while bermuda is as much as three quarters more expensive infrastructure in belize has seen a lot of improvement in recent years mr cobb pointed out but the cost of living is still low a four bedroom four bathroom home on ambergris caye can be had for about us 1 3 million according to realtor com which listed the price in dollars land alone might cost about us 500 000 mr cobb added more real estate investments are never recession proof but some are safer than others real estate prices are increasing as people catch on but where we stand here in early 2019 assertive investors are still well ahead of the curve he said mr cobb also mention parts of nicaragua especially areas near the border of costa rica the latter has become a true tourist hotspot but property just across the panama line is just as desirable less expensive and safe for tourists and foreign property owners in fact he lived there with his family for 14 years property is three to four times more expensive in costa rica than two miles away in nicaragua he said and the cost of living once there is silly cheap there is a misconception about building in these regions however although land prices may be far less than in the u s the cost of the materials remains about the same as one would find in the u s steel concrete windows doors are all still at the world market prices there s no discount mr cobb said the labor is less though about 15 to 20 less than in the u s from penta future returns should investors be concerned about bond yields europe ms anton said some spots in europe and other locales are also good bets because of brexit there s been a lot of instability in the london market ms anton said so

investors in the meantime they can enjoy london and all its amenities portugal is a favorite for overseas investors as well as it offers warm weather culture and a relatively low cost of living mr walker explained the euro has also slipped about 8 14 year over year according to marketwatch the conversion is 1 to about 1 12 click for more in depth analysis of luxury lifestyle news the country he added offers a lot of options for buyers who might look to lisbon the capital for city living or south to the algarve region for a beach house portugal is also popular with tourists with 13 million visiting every year so investment properties can double as short term rentals when not in use by the owners spain is another possibility like its neighbor portugal spain offers a lot of options for buyers including its coastal locals mr walker said costa calida costa blanca and the costa del sol are favorite beach destinations ibiza known for its nightlife and mallorca are part of the balearic islands to the north and are options for investors looking to stretch their dollars luxury properties either classic or modern are relatively affordable compared to other mediterranean locales these areas also have a revolving door of tourists that make renting an option ms anton has her eye on spain as well she s looking to the country s southern coast places like malaga or costa del sol where she said more americans are going lately the region has enough infrastructure to provide access to necessities like healthcare but offer an authentic local experience places like that that are off the

china versus the united states it s a geopolitical rivalry fraught with peril for investors the u s china trade war is making headlines again when it comes to the mysteries of the middle kingdom i turn to one analyst in particular for insights scott chan the sino specialist on our investing daily team scott chan pictured here is the lead analyst for real world investing and the complete investor i sat down with scott this week to discuss china and a range of related geopolitical topics first a bit of background scott chan moved from china to the u s with his family at the age of 10 he earned undergraduate degrees from new york university followed by an mba degree from the zicklin school of business at baruch college a multicultural person and keen observer of geopolitical trends scott reads and speaks fluent mandarin and cantonese chinese my first question was about the persistent trade war one of the biggest threats now facing investors will u s china trade negotiations once again break down is there an end in sight to the trade conflict or will it drag on for the rest of trump s tenure in office i do expect some kind of deal i think president trump wants to be able to claim he got a great deal when he runs for re election i am skeptical the two sides will be able come to a comprehensive agreement that resolves all the major issues i would be very happy to be proven wrong i think most likely there will be enough compromise to make a deal to avoid mutually harmful tariffs for the time being and leave issues to be tackled down the road to me that was always the most likely outcome it s just that we got a lot of extra drama now that china is such an important cog in the global economy the fear overhanging markets is of course that the trade war could escalate and drain growth out of the chinese economy and malaise spreads to everyone else to get a different perspective on china than from the u s mainstream media i monitor chinese language websites including popular discussion forums in regard to the trade war based on what i ve seen at the individual level it seems to be business as usual for most some even report doing better now than before i caution however that the discussions i ve followed are a small sample they are anecdotal in nature and the social media posters are mostly white collar folks so they don t represent the whole chinese economy however they do show that despite talk in the western press of the chinese economy being in trouble not every person in china is feeling gloom and doom recently the china caixin manufacturing pmi a measure of manufacturing activity maintained by hsbc nyse hsbc unexpectedly rose to 50 8 in march since bottoming at 48 3 in january the index has risen in back to back months the chinese government s own pmi read 50 5 a reading above 50 in both indexes indicates expansion so china isn t doing as badly as one may think based on some u s headlines which trade sensitive stocks should investors avoid because of the u s china showdown in the event of the trade war worsening u s companies in sectors like agriculture automobiles and tech will likely be in the crosshairs china is a top export market for u s agricultural goods like grains and seeds and these exports are top targets for china if talks break down and there are additional tariffs expect china to resume tariffs on u s autos tech companies that sell consumer goods in china could also face restrictions there if the trade war intensifies as an example late last year at the height of trade tensions china ordered an injunction on behalf of chip maker qualcomm nsdq qcom against apple nsdq aapl to ban iphone sales on the basis that apple s iphones violates software patents held by qualcomm apple was able to bypass the injunction by updating iphone to new software however if beijing wants to make things more difficult for apple and other u s companies selling products there it can additionally a drawn out trade war will result in more costly raw materials and could trigger higher costs across the board far beyond just the industries i just mentioned do you think china will overtake the united states as the world s largest economy by some measures it already has right on a purchasing power parity ppp basis china already is the largest economy the problem with headline gross domestic product gdp numbers is that they don t take into account different inflation and cost of living levels in each country because of price differences between countries 10 000 won t buy you the same amount of goods in the u s that the equivalent of 10 000 can get you in china to better compare gdp on a more apples to apples basis you need to adjust for the cost of living and inflation in different countries that s what ppp does on the other hand because china has many more people than the u s on a per capita basis it s still far behind the u s but it s improving china is growing much faster than the u s and its middle class is expanding international companies all want to get a piece of that pie china also is the world s largest trading nation imports plus exports so its importance in the global economy looms large china is the global growth engine the country s gross domestic product growth is slowing but just how pronounced is this slowdown and how worried should we be as recently as 2010 china grew by more than 10 nowadays it s more in the 6 range a lot of that has to do with china s crackdown on excessive risk taking according to president xi jinping s mandate some western analysts have been calling for a china hard landing for as long as i can remember so far china has proven them wrong based on my monitoring of chatter on chinese language forums chinese people on average don t seem to be feeling a huge squeeze to be clear i don t mean everyone should just be complacent investors should always remain vigilant but despite what you may read and hear in the u s mainstream media there are still good long term investment opportunities in china i especially like domestically focused chinese companies that benefit from the country s growing consumer market in the u s in recent years we have seen partisanship grind washington to a literal stop at times by contrast in china the chinese government has much more direct control over the chinese economy so it s able to respond and influence it in ways that washington simply cannot most economists the credible ones anyway agree that tariffs don t work but isn t it true that china wields at least some unfair trade practices and if so what s the best way to counteract them yes there s no doubt china has engaged in one sided practices it s not been an even playing field however as you mentioned tariffs don t work not only can countries find loopholes to get around them they tend to end up in a tit for tat cycle that hurts both sides especially given china s economic clout today it s not easy to counteract its advantages one way perhaps is for the u s to buy china s national currency the renminbi aka the yuan to increase the value of the yuan china has been buying the u s dollar for years and the net effect has been to lower the yuan another way to combat china s aggressive trading behavior is to build trade alliances multilateral pacts in the west create a unified stand against china to force the country to adopt fairer policies but instead of strengthening alliances president trump seems to prefer confrontation and unilateralism america also has the option of doing nothing there s often a lot of wisdom in non action if we recognize that a the u s benefits from free trade more than it is hurt by free trade even if china benefits more than us and if we recognize that b tariffs hurt us even if they hurt china then isn t choice a better if you d like to comment or ask questions about the u s china trade war send us an email mailbag investingdaily com john persinos is the managing editor

new zealand dollar highlights cut in new zealand interest rates now likely us china trade talks constructive business confidence slows again fresh brexit defeat on leave day sterling new zealand dollar gbpnzd fx technical analysis brexit dominates the day and week month quarter like most other sterling pairings gbpnzd has been dominated by the ups and downs of brexit with british mps still undecided about what to do as of the end of march when britain was supposed to leave the european union so it looks as if the issue will continue to affect the pound against the nz dollar over the next three months as will the choice of the new uk prime minister if theresa may does step down the worries for the new zealand dollar are mostly on the economic front with the reserve bank now hinting at a rate cut the outcome of the us china trade talks will also play an important part in the kiwi s fortunes from april june since our last quarterly report the pound rose from a low of 1 873 against the new zealand dollar in typical mid market rates this was on 15 february after the reserve bank of new zealand hinted it was not ready to cut rates the high of 1 951 came on 28 february on fears over cuts in new zealand interest rates and fresh hopes that a no deal brexit could be avoided following the defeat of theresa may s third brexit withdrawal agreement on 29 march the pound fell to around 1 908 the worries for the new zealand dollar are mostly on the economic front with the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz now hinting at a rate cut the outcome of the us china trade talks will also play an important part in the kiwi s fortunes from april june 2019 since our last quarterly report the pound rose from a low of 1 873 against the new zealand dollar in typical interbank rates this was on 15th february after the rbnz hinted it was not ready to cut rates the high of 1 951 came on 28th february on fears over cuts in new zealand interest rates and fresh hopes that a no deal brexit could be avoided following the defeat of theresa may s third brexit withdrawal agreement on 29th march the pound fell to around 1 908 cut in new zealand interest rates now likely at the end of march the rbnz took the market a little by surprise by stating that it believed interest rates could fall while keeping the official cash rate ocr at 1 75 for the time being governor adrian orr says given the weaker global economic outlook and reduced momentum in domestic spending the more likely direction of our next ocr move is down this sent the nzd falling against key partner currencies some market commentators now predict that the reserve bank of new zealand will now cut the rate by a quarter point in may and another later in 2019 the rbnz says employment is near its maximum sustainable level but core consumer price inflation remains below the 2 target mid point which means supportive monetary policy is still needed the global economic outlook has continued to weaken in particular amongst some of our key trading partners including australia europe and china this weaker outlook has prompted central banks to ease their expected monetary policy stances placing upward pressure on the new zealand dollar low interest rates and continued employment growth should support household spending and business investment the bank says government spending on infrastructure housing and transfer payments also supports domestic demand as capacity pressures build consumer price inflation is expected to rise to around the mid point of its target range however the balance of risks to this outlook has shifted to the downside the risk of a more pronounced global downturn has increased and low business sentiment continues to weigh on domestic spending on the upside inflation could rise faster if firms pass on cost increases to prices to a greater extent we will keep the ocr at an expansionary level for a considerable period to contribute to maximising sustainable employment and maintaining low and stable inflation us china trade talks constructive as us china talks resumed at the end of march to end the damaging trade war us treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the discussions in beijing had been constructive the hope is that talks set to follow in washington will also be constructive any positive outcome is likely to benefit the nz dollar over the next three months china is new zealand s number one trading partner for both imports and exports with two way trade valued at over 28 billion nz dollars in 2018 the us is new zealand s third largest individual trading partner however the positive news about the talks was not enough to immediately strengthen the new zealand dollar against the pound which was more focused on the latest brexit votes previously the united states and china agreed to put any new action on hold for 90 days until 1st march 2019 so they could talk further in the event they missed the deadline but agreed to continue talking president trump had previously been planning to increase tariffs on 200 billion us dollars of chinese goods from 10 to 25 so far the us has imposed trade duties on 250 billion us dollars worth of chinese goods in retaliation for unfair trade practices china added import duties on us products worth 110 billion dollars nz china talks to cement relationship in early march new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern is meeting chinese premier li keqiang after a bid by chinese telecom firm huawei to create a 5g mobile network was refused the intelligence agency rejected the bid due to security fears mr li called on new zealand to ensure there is a fair investment environment he said at present china new zealand ties overall are developing in a stable manner china also places a high importance on relations with new zealand and is willing to and we hope that we can aspire to the greatest common denominator regarding each other s interests and that when each side s businesses invest in each other s businesses they can enjoy a fair transparent convenient environment ms ardern says new zealand greatly values trade with china it is one of our most important and far reaching relationships we already enjoy a relationship with an impressive and innovative history and a very impressive future business confidence slows again after a brief rise business confidence is slowing again in new zealand sentiment slipped in march over economic fears according to the anz business outlook survey it showed a net 38 of respondents expected the economy to deteriorate over the year ahead up considerably from 30 9 in february a net 1 of firms expect to increase investment down 1 from previously employment intentions fell two points to a net 1 and profit expectations fell three points to a net 14 expecting profits to fall meanwhile new zealand small business confidence is below the asia pacific average according to the 10th annual certified practising accountants cpa australia asia pacific small business survey it shows 57 4 of new zealand businesses grew in the calendar year against survey average of 66 3 at the same time 63 2 of businesses expect to grow in the next 12 months the survey average is 68 8 fresh brexit defeat on leave day on the day that britain was supposed to be leaving the european union members of parliament ruled out prime minister theresa may s brexit withdrawal agreement for the third time in a desperate attempt to gain some momentum mrs may split the withdrawal element of her deal from the political part but mps still voted the blind brexit deal down by 344 votes to 286 a majority of 58 this sent the pound immediately falling against the new zealand dollar to 1 908 in typical mid market rates there are now fears that with the uk set to leave the eu on 12th april at the time of writing there is not likely to be enough time to legislate for a deal if the uk wanted a further extension it would need to hold european elections says mrs may the implications of the house s decision are grave the legal default now is that the united kingdom is due to leave the european union on 12th april an emergency eu summit has been hastily arranged for wednesday 10th april the european commission says a no deal scenario on 12th april is now a likely scenario in a bid to finally get her eu withdrawal agreement approved mrs may put forward the withdrawal agreement part of her brexit deal without the political declaration even so the european commission said that had the deal passed the uk could leave the european union without passing the political declaration british business bites back british business leaders again condemned the situation as a failure and a disaster for the uk economy and jobs mike cherry the chairman of the federation of small businesses fsb says on the day that we were supposed to be leaving the european union all we have is yet another political failure to chalk up responsibility for this deepening political crisis lies squarely at the feet of politicians who have clearly stopped listening to the business community stephen phipson chief executive officer of the manufacturers organisation make uk says this now makes the nightmare of a no deal scenario more likely than ever this would be a disaster for the uk economy as a whole and for the 2 7 million manufacturing jobs around the uk more indicative votes are taking place in early april in a bid to break the deadlock what s next for gbpnzd even though we have now passed the date when the uk was supposed to leave europe brexit is likely to remain the major focus for sterling over the next quarter interest rates the economy and us china trade talks are set to be major issues for the new zealand dollar looking ahead guidance for nzd buyers gbpnzd is still in an uptrend from the turn of the year trend line support comes in at 1 9000 at the moment so as long as the market stays above this level there is a good chance that the currency pair will head higher that being said there is chart resistance which has held on a handful of occasions at 1 9500 50 a break of here would suggest a quick move towards 1 9800 guidance for nzd sellers gbp nzd is struggling to break convincingly above 1 9500 protection should be left above that level if that holds again then it would be prudent to reduce any exposure close to the 1 9000 trend line support

there are only a few times when the federal reserve board makes a difference one was in 2008 when the banking system was collapsing ben bernanke then the fed chairman not only cut interest rates with abandon he went to the white house and asked president george w bush to rescue the banking system what became known as the tarp the banking bailout was the single most unpopular act of congress in memory but bernanke made the case for it not because he thought it would make a good sound bite and not to please his political patrons indeed the tarp ultimately doomed bernanke s republican party in the fall campaign but bernanke knew it was right he knew it because he had spent his career in academia and in government in the serious study of monetary policy he knew the fed had failed to act aggressively during the great depression and he wasn t going to repeat that mistake advertisement that snippet of history should be all the u s senate needs to reject stephen moore whom president trump has nominated for the federal reserve bernanke was the right expert at the right moment moore is not an expert in fact he epitomizes trump s loathing for experts thursday s news that trump means to double down and also appoint herman cain a pizza magnate and failed presidential contender to the board should disabuse the senate of any idea that moore is simply a one off trump means to remake the 105 year old agency into a partisan tool moore is a television and op ed pundit with a master s but not a doctoral degree he has a habit of being wrong on monetary policy for instance in 2009 when the economy was in free fall moore was telling glenn beck that the fed was creating hyperinflation that dollars aren t going to be worth anything with unemployment and home defaults soaring hyperinflation was the opposite of the risks that the united states faced the prediction turned out to be flat wrong advertisement in the past moore a distinguished visiting fellow at the heritage foundation has expressed qualified support for the gold standard it s worth noting that cain is an adamant defender of the gold standard as well the gold standard is the last refuge of monetary cranks who define themselves in opposition to expertise rather than have economists make difficult subjective decisions about the money supply they want to delegate policy to a totem emotionally they answer to the same urge as rick perry who as governor of texas in 2011 warned bernanke he would be treated pretty ugly if the fed chief ever set foot in his state moore has said that the federal reserve board members his putative future colleagues should be thrown out for economic malpractice he singled out the chairman jerome h powell for criticism he said of the institution he now wants to help lead the fed is the swamp that s from the guy who underpaid his taxes by 75 000 advertisement there is a long history of demagogues in the united states taking aim at experts a surprising number have focused on monetary policy andrew jackson the seventh president demonized the head of the second bank of the united states the closest the country had in those days to a central bank and vetoed the renewal of its charter the allure of the gold standard today is that it would sideline experts it would put gold miners in charge not the federal reserve but the gold supply has very little relation to how much credit the economy needs there is no science behind it it is like trusting the economy to religion in the 1920s fidelity to the gold standard ruined britain s economy and in the 1930s residual fidelity to gold worsened the depression in the united states share this article share moore s suggestion is not quite the gold standard it is a cousin of the gold standard he wants the fed to tie the money supply to commodities prices a basket of commodities not just precious metals this would have a perverse effect on the u s economy and on the dollar s buying power which statutorily are the fed s two concerns commodity prices are volatile they respond to wars product disruptions and to mere rumor they are speculative imagine for a second tying interest rates to the price of bitcoin fixing the money supply to the price of tin is not much better advertisement moore s idea is not new among others robert e hall of the hoover institution rigorously evaluated it and concluded a commodity standard is not clearly superior to the present system and that was in 1982 in the midst of the worst decade for central banks in modern times in defending his idea moore has shown a troubling disregard for facts in a recent op ed co written in the wall street journal moore referred to the commodity price rule used successfully by former fed chief paul volcker to break inflation in the early 80s he said mr volcker linked fed monetary policy to real time changes in commodity prices this is almost sheer invention volcker did raise interest rates but he had no commodity price rule i checked moore s assertion with alan blinder the former fed vice chairman blinder s comment that must be news to paul volcker advertisement i checked mr volcker gruff voiced at 91 told me there was no such rule commodity prices were one of many things we looked at the weird thing about commodity standard and gold standard bugs who inevitably invoke the fear of wheelbarrow inflation is they are prescribing a remedy for a problem that doesn t exist serious inflation in the united states hasn t been seen in decades since world war ii the fed has had only two troubling failures the inflation in the 1970s and the mortgage bubble in the 2000s each episode offers further reasons not to confirm moore and potentially cain in the 1970s inflation got out of hand when the then fed chair arthur burns knuckled under to a first term president worried about his reelection richard nixon ordered burns not to allow a recession even at the risk of stimulating inflation burns complied nixon won and inflation soared advertisement the run up to the second debacle emerged in the 1990s the fed chair then alan greenspan was far more than other fed chiefs an intensely political operator who nurtured close relationships with administrations he served though not subject to crude nixonesque or trumpesque bullying greenspan was eager to mollify his mistake was not so much low interest rates as an ideological resistance to regulating mortgages greenspan knelt at the altar of growth moore describes himself as a growth hawk the senate should find these precedents troubling like nixon trump is unhappy with the fed for raising rates he has tried to browbeat the federal reserve board into submission through twitter attacks on the fed and on powell personally it s hard to imagine that if approved moore will be a voice for independence moore has pandered to the president by repeating trump s criticisms of the fed he has groveled to trump by suggesting he deserves the nobel prize with arthur laffer he has written a fawning book trumponomics moore is also good friends with larry kudlow trump s economic adviser moore thus bids to become a new of kind of board member a presidential lackey greg mankiw a harvard economist who led the council of economic advisers in the bush administration said in reviewing trumponomics that it was written in the voice of the rah rah partisan were trump to fill the board with partisans the fed s prestige would collapse and so would its ability to implement policy advertisement with cain s pending nomination the prospect of a politically partisan fed is no longer remote cain is a vocal trump supporter he did serve on the kansas city federal reserve while it s common for businesspeople untutored in monetary policy to serve on local feds the governing board in washington has been reserved for bankers and economists its culture has been nonpartisan when bernanke was nominated most reporters did not know that he was republican
written by alan rappeport and neil irwin president donald trump said on thursday that he planned to nominate herman cain who abandoned his 2012 presidential bid in the face of escalating accusations of sexual misconduct for a seat on the federal reserve board advertisement trump speaking from the oval office called cain the former chief executive of godfather s pizza a truly outstanding individual and said i ve told my folks that s the man the decision to consider cain is the second time in weeks that the president has floated candidates with deeply held political views and past ethical issues to fill a seat on the fed signaling an intent to put allies on a traditionally independent body it comes as trump has continued to attack the fed and his hand picked chairman jerome powell for raising interest rates in 2018 saying those moves slowed economic growth advertisement last month trump said he planned to nominate stephen moore a conservative economist who advised his presidential campaign and has become a vocal critic of the fed s recent rate increases as a fed governor trump has staked his presidency on a booming economy and his re election could hinge on whether it continues to surge or falter the fed which has the ability to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates and using other tools at its disposal will play a crucial role in the economy s trajectory advertisement while presidents have long stocked regulatory agencies with partisan appointees in pursuit of ideological goals the fed s seven member board of governors has largely been an exception given the role it plays in the u s economy the fed s primary job is to guide the economy typically by adjusting interest rates it aims for sustainable growth maximum employment and stable prices it also regulates banks and oversees the plumbing of the financial system most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short term growth at the expense of inflation and instability some modern presidents have opined openly about what the fed should do including president george w bush who declared in a state of the union address that the central bank should keep rates low but in recent decades the volume of public commentary greatly diminished as politicians concluded that pressuring the fed was counterproductive advertisement the president has largely abandoned that tradition last year as interest rates rose and the stock market declined trump repeatedly attacked fed policy as crazy wild and loco he asked aides whether he could replace the chairman and lamented privately that powell s appointment was one of his biggest regrets the fed which raised rates for five consecutive quarters amid a roaring economy with the lowest unemployment rate in nearly two decades has since paused its campaign powell has repeatedly rebuffed any suggestion that the central bank is being influenced by trump s broadsides saying it is adopting a more patient approach to interest rates given signs of economic weakness in the united states and abroad with two open seats on the seven member fed trump has the ability to drastically shape the central bank for the foreseeable future the president has already appointed four of the fed s current governors who carry 14 year terms one governor lael brainard is a holdover from the obama administration advertisement the appointment and confirmation of moore and cain could put the fed in uncharted territory while the institution has strongly rooted values around technical competence and apolitical debate trump s latest choices have been political actors rather than in the weeds experts in any of the main areas in which the fed makes policy two governors alone cannot entirely shape fed policy but they can have an effect on decisions the federal open market committee which sets interest rates consists of 12 voting members including the seven governors the president of the federal reserve bank of new york and four regional federal reserve bank presidents who serve one year terms on a rotating basis changes to interest rates must be approved by a majority of the voting members both moore and cain are undergoing background checks and if nominated must be confirmed by the senate advertisement the choice of such candidates to fill two of the most powerful jobs in economic policy is raising fears among some fed veterans that the president is installing political allies at the central bank to do his bidding it s one thing to put cronies into the executive branch but i think the central bank is another kind of institution that it s so critical in that it holds the reins solely to monetary policy said sarah bloom raskin who served on the fed s board of governors from 2010 to 2014 it has the potential to undermine the credibility of monetary policy cain s nomination is being supported by larry kudlow who heads the national economic council and also recommended moore for a fed seat according to a person familiar with the discussions advertisement while he heaped praise on his friend herman cain trump earlier in the day continued his assault on the destructive actions taken by the fed and said on twitter that the economy was very strong despite the central bank s efforts the selection of both moore and cain appeared to be a counterweight to powell but while moore has been publicly critical of the fed and called for powell to resign cain s views are less clear as a presidential candidate cain rode a brief surge in popularity to the top of the polls on the back of his 9 9 9 economic plan the proposal called for scrapping the existing tax code and replacing it with a flat 9 percent income tax a 9 percent business tax and a 9 percent national retail sales tax the concept was hailed by some for its simplicity but it ultimately fizzled with his campaign advertisement on monetary policy his views are equally unorthodox in a 2012 op ed in the wall street journal cain accused the central bank of manipulating the value of the dollar by raising and lowering interest rates by whim and called for a return to the gold standard which was abandoned in 1971 for the last 40 years in washington regulate has meant manipulate with the federal reserve raising and lowering interest rates and buying and selling assets at its own discretion cain wrote arguing that a complex society needs fixed standards a dollar should be defined as it was prior to 1971 under the postwar bretton woods system as a fixed quantity of gold cain is also a former chairman of the federal reserve bank of kansas city a role that is often given to local business leaders in a 2011 interview with the atlantic drue jennings who served with cain on the board said cain was an inflation hawk when it came to monetary policy a moniker attributed to those who view rising prices as a threat to economic growth and favor higher interest rates to keep inflation in check advertisement trump has made clear he has no interest in a fed governor who wants to raise rates but more recently cain has shown that he has evolved on the subject if i were offered the job i would try to encourage the fed not to make inflation a fear factor because deflation as stephen moore had pointed out in a great article that he wrote along with another economist deflation is more of a fear factor than inflation cain said in a february interview with the fox business network perhaps most important to trump cain has shown that he is loyal to the president last september cain formed the america fighting back pac which has a mission of publicly rebutting what he believes is misinformation about trump advertisement we re offering a compelling solid refutation to what you hear from the media and the rest of the left about president trump and conservative ideas cain said at the time it is unclear whether cain will clear the background check his presidential campaign came to a screeching halt after several women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment in some ways cain who preferred news interviews to intensive retail campaigning presaged trump s own outsider campaign four years later but unlike the president s presidential bid cain s was fatally wounded when he faced charges of sexual misconduct advertisement in october 2011 politico reported that cain as head of the national restaurant association had been accused of sexually harassing two women who left the trade group after receiving financial payouts and signing nondisclosure agreements one of the women who was from chicago said cain made an unwanted and rough physical advance on her confronted with the claims cain initially did not deny them he later proclaimed his innocence and sought to cast blame on political rivals and the news media for what he called a smear campaign other women emerged soon after to say that they too had been sexually harassed by cain by that december he dropped out of the presidential race

vice president dr mahamudu bawumia the government s economic management team emt wednesday defended its pursuit of macro economic stability which is posting positive results saying it holds the key to an industrial revolution sustainable jobs and making things better for the poor addressing the maiden town hall meeting in accra members of the team chaired by vice president mahamudu bawumia rejected the criticism that the positive economic indices were not putting money in the pockets of people the vice president senior minister yaw osafo maafo the vice chair of the team and mr alan kwadwo kyerematen minister of trade and industry a member of the emt made the case when they addressed the meeting the meeting was to enable the emt to answer questions on the performance of the economy from representatives of civil society organisations academia and members of the public it was held under the theme our progress our status our future dr bawumia said it was imperative to strengthen the weak fundamentals of the macroeconomic economy that it inherited adding that significant progress had been made the prudent measures implemented by ministry of finance and the central bank were rubbing positively on the inflation rate gross domestic product gdp growth and debt sustainability among others the efficiency in expenditure management has come from prioritising and re allocation of spending to areas most needed fiscal deficit on cash basis has significantly fallen from 6 8 per cent of rebased gdp in 2016 to an estimated 3 8 per cent in 2018 on why the positive gains were not reflecting on the performance of the cedi against the dollar in recent times the vice president said the cedi depreciated by 8 4 per cent in 2018 largely on the account of emerging market pressures and us interest rate increases it cumulatively depreciated by 4 9 per cent at the end of 2017 dr bawumia pointed out that data on the annual rate of depreciating of the cedi showed that the worst performance from 2017 to 2018 was better than the best performance between 2012 and 2016 the depreciation rate for 2016 was 9 6 per cent its best performance since 2011 in 2014 the exchange rate depreciated by 31 3 per cent the fiscal deficit was 10 1 per cent public debt to gdp rose to 70 2 per cent inflation rose to 17 per cent and gdp growth declined from 7 3 per cent to four per cent in other words economic fundamentals had weakened significantly and therefore the depreciation was easily explainable the vice president said although the start of 2019 was characterised by another sudden bout of the sharp depreciation of the cedi this had since been reversed within a week the cedi reached ghc5 9 to the dollar in the market but sharply appreciated to ghc5 07 to the dollar an unprecedented development and without any intervention from the bank of ghana as at march 29 the year to date depreciation of the cedi for the first quarter of 2019 stood at 5 18 per cent explaining the performance of the cedi within the period the vice president said the bank of ghana had no room to intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to meet the approved international monetary fund imf programme action thus it had to rather build up its reserves in a period of extreme demand pressures by some 800 million this partly explains why the ghana cedi came under significant pressure during this period which was exacerbated by speculation the reason for the sudden reversal in the sharp depreciation that we observed was that the market corrected itself investor sentiments expectations and uncertainties acknowledged that the fundamentals are much stronger than suspected and that even without imf the fiscal and monetary are assured for his part mr osafo maafo said the macro economic indicators meant a lot because if there was no stability the capacity to progress would be jeopardised a positive gdp growth would foster productivity while a higher inflation rate would distress the poor in the society because that undermined the ability spend inflation is the enemy of the poor therefore the positive indices cannot be taken for granted mr kyerematen noted that the right fundamentals were critical for the industrial revolution the creation of sustainable jobs and the attraction of both local and foreign investors to provide essential social services as the americans say it ain t gonna happen if you don t build a stable macro economic environment the other members of the emt mr john peter amewu energy minister mr ken ofori atta finance minister dr owusu afriyie akoto the minister of food and agriculture professor george gyan baffour minister of planning and dr anthony akoto osei minister of monitoring and evaluation also answered questions at the forum

china s economic expansion will continue to moderate in 2019 and 2020 amid uncertainty caused by trade tensions with the u s the impact of curbs on shadow banking slowing growth in household income and weakening prospects for the labor market the asian development bank adb said in its annual outlook released wednesday the world s second largest economy is likely to see gross domestic product gdp increase 6 3 this year down from a 6 6 pace in 2018 and slow further to a more sustainable 6 1 in 2020 the manila based lender said in its latest asian development outlook although it pointed out that the forecasts are subject to external uncertainties and domestic risks the prc people s republic of china economy remains strong despite the growth slowdown in recent years adb chief economist yasuyuki sawada said although the slowing trend will likely persist if the trade uncertainty continues favorable fiscal reforms at the start of the year particularly on personal income tax and social security will help alleviate the adverse effects of anticipated weaker wage growth and boost domestic consumption although an agreement between beijing and washington to resolve their trade conflict would limit adverse effects on china s economic expansion and help revive consumer and investor sentiment gdp growth will still be lower as ongoing restrictions on shadow banking continue to limit expansion in credit to the economy the report said the government has already adopted a more accommodative monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy to help cushion the slowdown and stabilize growth the adb said pointing to reductions in banks reserve requirement ratios lower interbank lending rates and significant tax cuts the adb said these policies are likely to continue although it doesn t expect any major stimulus financial stability however if the policies are seen as insufficient to stabilize economic growth there is a risk policymakers will abandon efforts to stabilize lending and or loosen restrictions on shadow banking thereby allowing nonbank financing to reaccelerate and debt to balloon the report said such measures would boost growth in the short run but endanger financial stability over the longer term it said sustaining growth in china depends instead on continued efforts to control financial leverage and on accelerated structural reform the adb pointed out that despite efforts by the people s bank of china to lower interest rates in the interbank market and to encourage lending banks have been reluctant to cut borrowing costs partly because deposit rates have remained unchanged which squeezes the profit they earn on their loans it suggested the central bank could lower its benchmark one year lending and deposit rates simultaneously which would reduce financing costs for the real economy while also preserving banks interest margin such loosening would benefit in particular highly indebted enterprises by lowering their interest payments it said the adb also pointed out that while tax cuts are supporting growth the direct effect of lowering value added tax rates will likely be modest as only companies in markets with fierce competition will pass on the lower rates to customers given slowing economic growth most firms are expected to save that extra revenue instead of investing it in addition growth in fiscal revenue will slow as a result of the cuts and that will put additional pressure on budgets at both central and local government levels which will limit their ability to increase public spending the report said trade talks the main downside risk to growth on the international side will come from an intensification of trade conflict with the u s in the absence of a durable agreement the adb said failure to reach a deal would have spillover effects and harm investor and consumer sentiment it said china s vice premier liu he is currently in washington to continue talks with u s officials for an agreement to resolve the dispute he met u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin and trade representative robert lighthizer on wednesday and is scheduled to meet u s president donald trump in the oval office on thursday in the last round of trade talks in beijing at the end of march the official xinhua news agency reported the two countries made new progress on the text of an agreement to end the row contact reporter liu jiefei jiefeiliu caixin com

by reuters by hari kishan and shrutee sarkar bengaluru reuters the euro will rebound from its worst start to a year since 2015 to gain over the coming 12 months according to a reuters poll of analysts although they warned that risks to that view were skewed to the downside having lost nearly 4 5 percent against the dollar in 2018 the euro has not fared any better so far this year falling more than 2 percent in january march its worst first quarter performance in four years that was mostly driven by weak growth and inflation prospects for the region which pushed the european central bank to rule out any rate hikes this year and announce new long term cheap loans known as tltros but the poll of more than 75 currency analysts taken this week showed the euro will reverse that trend and gain about 5 percent in a year to 1 18 from around 1 12 on thursday the single currency began to rise at the start of april on news that talks on trade between the united states and china appeared to be making headway while europe remains impacted by external trade concerns assuming an easing in china u s trade tensions into h2 and a resulting turn in external data we look for a stronger medium run euro profile said jeremy stretch head of g10 fx strategy at cibc capital markets the introduction of fresh tltros helps to alleviate a potential cliff in funding costs for euro zone banks while increased fiscal stimulus will also be supportive for the euro economic data out of the euro zone in recent weeks has given few reasons to be optimistic but the u s economy is also experiencing a slowdown which has forced the federal reserve to make a u turn on policy the fed s dot plot projections now suggest no hikes in 2019 compared with two predicted in december with economists in a separate reuters poll ruling out any tightening next year too we don t expect the ecb to be dynamic when it comes to interest rate hikes but we see an end to interest rate hikes in the u s so the momentum will turn sometime in the future in favour of the euro said dekabank economist christian melzer this survey marks the 20th consecutive poll in which analysts have predicted the euro will gain over the 12 month forecast horizon but during that period it has lost close to 5 percent against the dollar the latest consensus was the lowest since a poll in september 2017 and the range of forecasts showed lower lows for the single currency for the second survey in a row over 65 percent of analysts who answered an extra question said the risk to their euro forecasts for the coming year was skewed more to the downside there may be a little bit more downside to go on the euro to reflect the weakness of the euro zone economy the impact of political uncertainty also the more dovish bias of the ecb said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank however analysts were less clear about the dollar respondents were split right down the middle when asked if the risk to their dollar forecasts was skewed more to the upside or downside there s nothing like as much gloom yet about the u s as there is about europe so no wonder the euro is anchored firmly to the bottom of its trading range said kit juckes global head of fx strategy at societe generale advertisement if you re a u s economic pessimist who wants to be a dollar bear my best recommendation is that you go back into hibernation for a little longer although most major economies are expected to experience a protracted economic slowdown the united states is likely to be relatively stable which should keep the dollar in play we are in the battle of uglies now when it comes to fundamentals and the dollar is probably just the least ugly said rabobank s foley polling by indradip ghosh and mumal rathore editing by catherine evans

the government s economic management team emt wednesday defended its pursuit of macro economic stability which is posting positive results saying it holds the key to an industrial revolution sustainable jobs and making things better for the poor addressing the maiden town hall meeting in accra members of the team chaired by vice president mahamudu rejected the criticism that the positive economic indices were not putting money in the pockets of people the vice president senior minister yaw osafo maafo the vice chair of the team and mr alan kwadwo kyerematen minister of trade and industry a member of the emt made the case when they addressed the meeting the meeting was to enable the emt to answer questions on the performance of the economy from representatives of civil society organisations academia and members of the public it was held under the theme our progress our status our future dr bawumia said it was imperative to strengthen the weak fundamentals of the macroeconomic economy that it inherited adding that significant progress had been made the prudent measures implemented by ministry of finance and the central bank were rubbing positively on the inflation rate gross domestic product gdp growth and debt sustainability among others the efficiency in expenditure management has come from prioritising and re allocation of spending to areas most needed fiscal deficit on cash basis has significantly fallen from 6 8 per cent of rebased gdp in 2016 to an estimated 3 8 per cent in 2018 on why the positive gains were not reflecting on the performance of the cedi against the dollar in recent times the vice president said the cedi depreciated by 8 4 per cent in 2018 largely on the account of emerging market pressures and us interest rate increases it cumulatively depreciated by 4 9 per cent at the end of 2017 dr bawumia pointed out that data on the annual rate of depreciating of the cedi showed that the worst performance from 2017 to 2018 was better than the best performance between 2012 and 2016 the depreciation rate for 2016 was 9 6 per cent its best performance since 2011 in 2014 the exchange rate depreciated by 31 3 per cent the fiscal deficit was 10 1 per cent public debt to gdp rose to 70 2 per cent inflation rose to 17 per cent and gdp growth declined from 7 3 per cent to four per cent in other words economic fundamentals had weakened significantly and therefore the depreciation was easily explainable the vice president said although the start of 2019 was characterised by another sudden bout of sharp depreciation of the cedi this had since been reversed within a week the cedi reached ghc5 9 to the dollar in the market but sharply appreciated to ghc5 07 to the dollar an unprecedented development and without any intervention from the bank of ghana as at march 29 the year to date depreciation of the cedi for the first quarter of 2019 stood at 5 18 per cent explaining the performance of the cedi within the period the vice president said the bank of ghana had no room to intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to meet the approved international monetary fund imf programme action thus it had to rather build up its reserves in a period of extreme demand pressures by some 800 million this partly explains why the ghana cedi came under significant pressure during this period which was exacerbated by speculation the reason for the sudden reversal in the sharp depreciation that we observed was that the market corrected itself investor sentiments expectations and uncertainties acknowledged that the fundamentals are much stronger than suspected and that even without imf the fiscal and monetary are assured for his part mr osafo maafo said the macro economic indicators meant a lot because if there was no stability the capacity to progress would be jeopardised a positive gdp growth would foster productivity while a higher inflation rate would distress the poor in the society because that undermined the ability spend inflation is the enemy of the poor therefore the positive indices cannot be taken for granted mr kyerematen noted that the right fundamentals were critical for industrial revolution creation of sustainable jobs and the attraction of both local and foreign investors to provide essential social services as the americans say it ain t gonna happen if you don t build a stable macro economic environment the other members of the emt mr john peter amewu energy minister mr ken ofori atta finance minister dr owusu afriyie akoto the minister of food and agriculture professor george gyan baffour minister of planning and dr anthony akoto osei minister of monitoring and evaluation also answered questions at the forum

some experts suggest that the global drop off in listed firms is a sign of worrying times ahead for markets around the world this january interlink electronics a us technology company specialising in human machine interface and force sensing technologies announced its voluntary delisting from nasdaq a quote by the company s ceo steven bronson explained the reasons for the decision to better position interlink to accelerate long term profitable growth we undertook a thorough and thoughtful review of our cost structure including costs associated with being a nasdaq listed and sec reporting company there is nothing noteworthy about a company relinquishing the privilege of being listed on the stock market these days it would seem that there is nothing noteworthy about a company relinquishing the privilege of being listed on the stock market these days such a move is all too common since 1996 the number of public companies in the us has almost halved see fig 1 with delistings exponentially increasing and ipos also dropping the average number of listed companies per one million us citizens has also halved since 1976 according to a recent report by the national bureau of economic research a us think tank the study found that the us has roughly 5 000 fewer listed companies than would be expected for a country of its size population economic development and rule of law the picture is similar on the other side of the atlantic since 2000 the number of listed companies has dropped by 37 percent in germany and by 23 percent in the uk see fig 2 the research resurgence academics and market analysts do not agree on the causes of the crisis or whether this is a crisis at all a popular theory focuses on the rise of the knowledge economy one of its main proponents professor rené stulz argues that in the technology sector investment in research and development makes going public a risky option as stulz suggested in a recent paper if a firm invests in intangibles it is much more difficult for its management to convince investors that it will make good use of its money if the firms give too much detail which they could be forced to do by disclosure laws if public their competitors can use the information if they give too little detail investors will pay little for their shares it is not surprising therefore that for such firms participation in public markets with their disclosure requirements is likely to be onerous the case of interlink electronics a world leader in printed electronics with operations in singapore china hong kong and japan corroborates this theory the company s delisting announcement noted the resulting reduction in operating expenses will allow us to invest greater amounts towards research and development and sales which is a superior use of our limited resources the california based firm had reregistered just three years ago hoping to tap into capital markets to accelerate growth however things did not go as planned as the firm s leadership decided that the benefits to the company and its stockholders of continued nasdaq listing and sec reporting did not justify the costs of maintaining that listing and continuing to publicly report currently the company asserts that it has a strong balance sheet with no debt and does not need to raise more capital to meet its targets but this case is the rule rather than the exception in the technology sector for many companies the obligations that accompany a listing are too costly and burdensome john van rossen managing partner for ey s private equity advisory business in europe the middle east india and africa told world finance governance and reporting requirements have strengthened in the public markets in the recent past with a knock on implication for the costs to maintain a listing for some analysts overregulation is the main culprit for the shrinking of stock markets another side effect of the increasing importance of the technology sector is the rise of the faang powerhouses facebook apple amazon netflix and google which dominate their markets and frequently acquire smaller tech companies before they become big enough to go public this was the case with facebook s acquisition of instagram dr klaus heiner röhl a researcher at the german institute for economic research in berlin said investment in buildings machinery and equipment becomes less important for companies while investment in intangible capital such as software and patents is essential the rise of intangible investment is often associated with network effects a good or a service yields more utility to a customer when more people are using it these network effects enable monopoly rents and thereby contribute to more concentration germany is a good example of such a market röhl told world finance in germany non financial corporations were traditionally highly interconnected to other corporations by their holdings of company shares but german companies have decreased their holdings of listed shares and increased their direct acquisitions instead since 2000 this mirrors a new investment policy in the knowledge economy companies acquire the knowledge and the patents of other companies through the acquisition of the whole company some experts hope the trend may be reversed once more technology companies decide to go public sharing economy powerhouses such as airbnb uber and lyft are expected to be listed this year however professor jay ritter an academic at the university of florida who has been dubbed mr ipo for his work on the subject is not optimistic it looks as though the long awaited ipos of some of the big tech unicorns will happen this year but most smaller companies will not go public they will merge instead typically by being bought by a large company in their industry death by red tape for some analysts overregulation is the main culprit for the shrinking of stock markets in the us criticism focuses on the sarbanes oxley act which was passed in 2002 as a response to the furore that followed the collapse of worldcom and enron due to illegal accounting practices the law requires public companies to hire external auditors to scrutinise internal controls critics argue that this can be too onerous for smaller companies costing them up to six times more for accounting compared with larger firms according to the sec others point to the jobs act which increased the number of investors private companies are allowed to have before they need to report publicly private equity firms have come under fire for their contribution to the shrinking of the stock market recognising the problem sec chairman jay clayton has announced the commission s intention to provide smaller fast growing companies with incentives to list one of the proposals under consideration is the possibility of allowing these companies to hold informal talks with investors before announcing a listing so that they can test the waters for an ipo in the eu one of the goals of the recently established capital markets union is to make listings easier for smaller companies the policy enables firms with fewer than 500 employees to issue stocks under a less restrictive regulatory framework lowering the costs of an ipo markus demary a senior economist specialising in monetary policy and finance at the cologne institute for economic research told world finance what needs to be done additionally is to reduce the costs of being a public company through a reduction in the complexity of disclosure requirements but without undermining investor protection market volatility in the markets may also prevent start ups from considering an ipo last august elon musk sent shock waves when he tweeted his intention to take tesla a hi tech car manufacturer out of the stock market the price of the company s shares skyrocketed but plunged soon thereafter when the sec launched an investigation into musk s behaviour leslie pfrang a partner at the ipo consultancy class v group who has previously led the sales team for hundreds of technology ipos told world finance short sellers can outsize the market in thinly traded stocks especially vulnerable post ipo and promulgate rumours volatility and runs on stocks whether or not the fundamentals call for it this is a big issue for companies looking at ipos and access to future liquidity because they see this kind of activity especially around lock up expiration and when the company has limited liquidity post ipo as something that creates risk double edged equity sword the impact of the drop in ipos is exacerbated by the rapid increase of delistings with the exception of one year more companies have delisted from the us stock exchange than gone public over the past two decades one reason is the explosion of mergers and acquisitions driven by increasing private equity buyouts since 2000 around 15 percent of delistings in terms of market valuation have involved at least one private equity firm half of these companies are permanently delisted demary told world finance selling a company to another private equity firm or fund has become an alternative to an ipo this is an attractive option for a firm because the private market is less regulated compared to the public market 37 decline in listed companies in germany since 2000 23 decline in listed companies in the uk since 2000 5 000 fewer listed companies in the us than would be expected for its size population and economy 15 of stock market delistings since 2000 have involved at least one private equity firm private equity firms have come under fire for their contribution to the shrinking of the stock market and the dwindling participation of smaller investors criticism focuses on regulatory privileges that have driven the increase in buyouts such as tax breaks and the treatment of profits as capital gains rather than income pfrang said debt is tax deductible and carried interest is taxed at capital gains rates when drawn this gives private equity firms that leverage up their equity investments and pay themselves in carried interest a big advantage so private valuations have risen sometimes higher than public market valuations and that private capital comes with very few strings attached and very little oversight by those investors as we saw in uber and a few other cases for smaller companies the exponential increase of private capital is a boon currently just over half of all capital raised in the us by start ups is coming from the private market staying private helps them skip the burdensome process of hiring lawyers and accountants to comply with sec rules van rossen said the direct governance model in private equity by the capital provider avoids the need for public company style reporting requirements however the industry and its funding sources are conscious of their role in the financial markets and their responsibility to stakeholders and have in some cases taken initiatives to enhance disclosures on a voluntary basis the opacity of smaller markets smaller stock markets can have dire consequences for investors many experts warn kara stein an sec commissioner until january 2019 has repeatedly highlighted the importance of transparency in financial markets private companies are required to disclose a limited amount of data compared with public ones although public information is necessary for investors and companies to make decisions as stein put it in an interview the oversized growth of private markets at the expense of public ones could create a deterioration in price discovery less transparency also increases the risk of investors taking a major hit in the case of a crisis given that investor protections in the private market are weaker in markets where private equity capital is less abundant than in the us even start ups may find it difficult to raise funds röhl told world finance we observe that at least in germany retail investors as well as institutional investors have decreased their holdings of company stocks an indication that less capital is flowing into public markets this can lead to funding shortages for potentially high growth companies which is mirrored in the declining number of ipos this is more of a problem for german high growth companies than for their counterparts in the us and the uk because in contrast to the us and uk private equity is less available in germany as an alternative to an ipo some experts go as far as linking the decline of listings with the rise of inequality and populism on both sides of the atlantic in an influential paper swedish economists alexander ljungqvist joacim tåg and lars persson claimed that delistings can reduce citizens exposure to corporate profits and undermine support for business friendly and free trade policies the authors warned that a shrinking stock market can trigger a chain of events that leads to long term reductions in aggregate investment productivity and employment by being excluded from capital markets the average voter cannot reap the benefits of globalisation through increased share prices many are worried that the shrinking of stock markets reflects a bigger crisis the concentration of corporate earnings in a small number of companies fewer options on the stock market can also lead to a less diversified portfolio that can put smaller investors insurance and retirement plans at risk demary said the decline of ipos could increase inequality because it lowers the opportunities for average retail investors to put their money into high growth companies instead of going public these companies are acquired by private equity firms in which high net worth individuals can invest but the average investor cannot however other experts find these concerns overblown ritter said i find the ljungqvist et al hypothesis rather far fetched in the us most stockholders own stock indirectly through mutual funds and they have no idea whether their portfolio owns 100 or 500 or 3 000 different companies he added total market cap has not declined it is just split among fewer but larger companies investors still get the benefits of diversification although there are no autonomous vehicle companies that are publicly traded investors can get exposure to this technology by owning alphabet with its waymo division or tesla audi and other companies also are developing self driving capability others believe that for most companies the benefits of going public still outweigh the costs pfrang told world finance a company that sells mission critical saas or security software to large enterprises may win more customers when these see that the company they plan to rely on to run a key part of their enterprise technology has thousands of other customers who are buying more of their products every year and a healthy balance sheet we hear from ceos all the time have gone through the process that their companies become more focused and disciplined and better able to attack competitive opportunities many analysts are worried that the slow shrinking of stock markets reflects a bigger crisis the concentration of corporate earnings in a small number of companies over the past few years the earnings of the top 200 us firms have exceeded or approximated those of all other public firms combined during the same period of time us public firms have shown a preference for returning equity to investors rather than raising new capital exacerbating fears that stock markets are becoming a mechanism for rewarding shareholders several measures have been proposed to reinvigorate stock markets to curb the increase in delistings many experts have suggested that governments should strive to reduce the costs of investing in privately held firms for smaller investors or alternatively force these companies to disclose more information on their activities others propose the elimination of tax breaks or even tax hikes for private equity buyouts however this is practically difficult given the information asymmetry between retail and institutional investors on both sides of the atlantic investment in private companies is almost exclusively reserved for accredited investors funds and high net worth individuals roni michaely professor of finance at the geneva finance research institute is not optimistic that things will change for the better the combination of increased concentration and increased profitability of the stock market will drive another wedge between people who own equity and those who make a living from their work
vice president dr mahamudu bawumia the government s economic management team emt wednesday defended its pursuit of macro economic stability which is posting positive results saying it holds the key to an industrial revolution sustainable jobs and making things better for the poor addressing the maiden town hall meeting in accra members of the team chaired by vice president mahamudu bawumia rejected the criticism that the positive economic indices were not putting money in the pockets of people the vice president senior minister yaw osafo maafo the vice chair of the team and mr alan kwadwo kyerematen minister of trade and industry a member of the emt made the case when they addressed the meeting the meeting was to enable the emt to answer questions on the performance of the economy from representatives of civil society organisations academia and members of the public it was held under the theme our progress our status our future dr bawumia said it was imperative to strengthen the weak fundamentals of the macroeconomic economy that it inherited adding that significant progress had been made the prudent measures implemented by ministry of finance and the central bank were rubbing positively on the inflation rate gross domestic product gdp growth and debt sustainability among others the efficiency in expenditure management has come from prioritising and re allocation of spending to areas most needed fiscal deficit on cash basis has significantly fallen from 6 8 per cent of rebased gdp in 2016 to an estimated 3 8 per cent in 2018 on why the positive gains were not reflecting on the performance of the cedi against the dollar in recent times the vice president said the cedi depreciated by 8 4 per cent in 2018 largely on the account of emerging market pressures and us interest rate increases it cumulatively depreciated by 4 9 per cent at the end of 2017 dr bawumia pointed out that data on the annual rate of depreciating of the cedi showed that the worst performance from 2017 to 2018 was better than the best performance between 2012 and 2016 the depreciation rate for 2016 was 9 6 per cent its best performance since 2011 in 2014 the exchange rate depreciated by 31 3 per cent the fiscal deficit was 10 1 per cent public debt to gdp rose to 70 2 per cent inflation rose to 17 per cent and gdp growth declined from 7 3 per cent to four per cent in other words economic fundamentals had weakened significantly and therefore the depreciation was easily explainable the vice president said although the start of 2019 was characterised by another sudden bout of the sharp depreciation of the cedi this had since been reversed within a week the cedi reached ghc5 9 to the dollar in the market but sharply appreciated to ghc5 07 to the dollar an unprecedented development and without any intervention from the bank of ghana as at march 29 the year to date depreciation of the cedi for the first quarter of 2019 stood at 5 18 per cent explaining the performance of the cedi within the period the vice president said the bank of ghana had no room to intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to meet the approved international monetary fund imf programme action thus it had to rather build up its reserves in a period of extreme demand pressures by some 800 million this partly explains why the ghana cedi came under significant pressure during this period which was exacerbated by speculation the reason for the sudden reversal in the sharp depreciation that we observed was that the market corrected itself investor sentiments expectations and uncertainties acknowledged that the fundamentals are much stronger than suspected and that even without imf the fiscal and monetary are assured for his part mr osafo maafo said the macro economic indicators meant a lot because if there was no stability the capacity to progress would be jeopardised a positive gdp growth would foster productivity while a higher inflation rate would distress the poor in the society because that undermined the ability spend inflation is the enemy of the poor therefore the positive indices cannot be taken for granted mr kyerematen noted that the right fundamentals were critical for the industrial revolution the creation of sustainable jobs and the attraction of both local and foreign investors to provide essential social services as the americans say it ain t gonna happen if you don t build a stable macro economic environment the other members of the emt mr john peter amewu energy minister mr ken ofori atta finance minister dr owusu afriyie akoto the minister of food and agriculture professor george gyan baffour minister of planning and dr anthony akoto osei minister of monitoring and evaluation also answered questions at the forum

for the 13th time in three decades pakistan formally requested an imf loan in october triggering on going discussions between prime minister imran khan s government and the fund pakistan s economic woes persist as it battles mammoth twin deficits deteriorating foreign currency reserves low exports diminishing tax revenues a weak currency onerous external debt payments and soaring sovereign debt despite interventions to stave off a balance of payments crisis that would force pakistan to submit to the fund such as currency devaluations by pakistan s central bank a 1 billion loan from saudi arabia a reported 2 billion pledge from china and the issuance by pakistan of 1 billion worth of bonds to its citizens living overseas dialogue between the imf and pakistan on the way forward continues the focus of the imf programs was never institutional improvement but structural adjustments which only protected the interests of a small elite as these neoliberal policies worked well for them and not the general people abdul khaliq cadtm pakistan the road ahead however could prove bumpy a february statement by imf managing director christine lagarde highlighting that the imf stands ready to support pakistan followed a claim from a senior official that khan ordered the finance ministry to prepare for a domestic backlash against approaching the imf the official stated the conditions associated with a loan will include some harsh measures and the government will have to be very prepared to explain why pakistan has been forced to return to the imf under some of the previous imf structural adjustment programmes over the last four decades debt justice network cadtm pakistan revealed that the unemployment rates increased as did levels of inequality and poverty as reported in pakistan based the news international last august a large rally was held opposing further imf loans and condemning what they expected would be further privatisation which participants noted would be to the detriment of the working classes and result in costlier education healthcare electricity gas food and other items of daily living according to pakistan today the speculated forthcoming loan conditions include a general sales tax hike currency devaluation and the privatisation of state enterprises demonstrating a lack of deviation from programmes gone by see updates 83 72 64 us china trade tensions amid escalating us china trade tensions and unease over china s alleged use of debt diplomacy as an element of its bilateral development approach u s secretary of state mike pompeo warned in july make no mistake we will be watching what the imf does there s no rationale for imf tax dollars and associated with that american dollars that are part of the imf funding for those to go to bail out chinese bondholders or china itself a senior pakistani government adviser responded to pompeo s comment by telling the financial times the americans are trying very hard to put pressure on pakistan because they have their own interests but making it so hard for pakistan to successfully negotiate a new program with the imf makes no sense ultimately pakistan will search for other options if the road to the imf is blocked pakistan is not the first instance in which the alleged political neutrality of the fund in matters of geopolitics is being called into question as the debate about the role of the imf in greece clearly demonstrates see observer summer 2015 a painful debt cycle research in 2017 by uk based civil society organisation jubilee debt campaign uk jdc showed that in 30 of the last 42 years pakistan has received loans from the imf making this one of the most sustained periods of lending to any country on the question of why a country whose last imf programme ended in 2016 has already requested another loan a former senior imf official told the financial times in november assessing debt sustainability is at the heart of imf competence if you get it wrong or go about it without the information it hurts your credibility noting the sustained lack of debt sustainability international civil society organisation islamic relief and jdc 2013 report argued that imf loans have been passed down through generations with imposed economic conditions that make it even harder to build a stable economic future the report avowed the imf lends money so debt payments can be made it bails out the original lenders at the cost of the future generations which inherit the debt pakistan s history is just one of many examples of how this strategy is failing the world s poorest communities abdul khaliq president of cadtm pakistan stated the cycle of imf programmes with pakistan is painfully frequent as compared to other countries adding that under previous imf programmes pakistan mostly saw negative impacts on its economic growth any improvement in country s macroeconomic indicators was artificial during the time of imf programs he stressed that the focus of the imf programs was never institutional improvement but structural adjustments which only protected the interests of small elite as these neoliberal policies worked well for them and not the general people commenting on the new guiding principles on human rights impact assessments of economic reforms which were adopted by the united nations in march and are aimed at governments and international financial institutions see observer spring 2019 pakistan s official statement in february noted we fully agree that the impact of economic reform measures and policies should be evaluated in correlation to the existing international human rights norms and standards we therefore believe that external creditors must also carry out an impact assessment of their conditionalities on the population of a state receiving the loan this will also be helpful to the state concerned in undertaking an informed policy decision
bangladesh needs to come up with reforms at the earliest to sustain the growth momentum which has landed it among the five fastest growing economies in the world the world bank said yesterday the washington based multilateral lender tipped the bangladesh economy to grow at 7 3 percent this fiscal year which however is lower than the prediction of the government 8 13 percent and the asian development bank 8 percent as per the wb projection only four countries other than bangladesh will achieve more than 7 percent economic growth this year they are india 7 5 percent bhutan 7 6 percent rwanda 7 8 percent and ethiopia 8 8 percent and yet bangladesh faces several short and long term development challenges the wb said in its spring 2019 edition of the bangladesh development update one of the immediate challenges is to address the issues of banking sector vulnerabilities revenue shortfall and pressure on foreign exchange reserves according to the report unveiled at the wb office in dhaka yesterday the banking sector is struggling with non performing loans and private sector credit growth has slowed down too wb country director robert j saum said while unveiling the report with a special focus on regulatory predictability high non performing loans npls compounded by an eroding capital base continue to pose financial stability risks the wb said directed lending poor risk management and weak corporate governance stemming from lack of enforcement and regulatory independence lead to the rise in npls at the end of last year the banking sector s total npls stood at tk 93 911 crore up 26 38 percent year on year according to bangladesh bank data at the same time the practice of loan rescheduling and write offs also increased putting further stress on banks last year the central bank approved loan rescheduling of tk 20 000 crore despite these wholesale approvals of loan rescheduling default loans are increasing the report said last week finance minister ahm mustafa kamal announced an easy loan rescheduling scheme for defaulters from may 1 the defaulters will be able to reschedule their loans for 12 years by making 2 percent down payment of the total dues at present defaulters can reschedule their loans for at most 3 years by providing 10 to 15 percent down payment speaking at the programme zahid hussain lead economist at the wb s dhaka office said frequent and wholesale rescheduling of bad loans is not sustainable for banks we will end up killing the goose that lays the golden eggs if the goose dies then where will further rescheduling and fresh loans come from he noted in its report the wb called for tightening regulation on loan rescheduling and stopping special rescheduling it also recommended ensuring true autonomy of the bb as the sole regulator of the financial sector and also full regulatory oversight on the state owned banks the wb country director said another matter of worry for bangladesh is that the domestic revenue mobilisation was well behind the target so far this year in the first six months of fiscal 2018 19 the revenue growth was only 6 4 percent higher than the corresponding period of the previous year the smallest in recent memory the report mentioned about slow revenue growth zahid said how will development expenditure be increased for higher growth without increasing the revenue the report also highlighted the pressure on the exchange rate which can pose a macroeconomic risk the foreign exchange reserves have been stagnant for a while which was not the case before zahid said and yet bangladesh s growth outlook remains stable and strong thanks to the stable macroeconomic front and export oriented industry led growth according to the wb report sound macroeconomic policies such as keeping the budget deficit below 5 percent of the gdp and resilient domestic demand have led to growth in manufacturing and construction industries on the supply side it said on the demand side growth is led by private consumption and exports after a modest performance last year export earnings and remittances have bounced back helping the rural economy to grow faster in addition the country has substantially improved its electricity generation and a bumper agricultural harvest has further stimulated growth the wb pointed out however sustaining the rapid economic growth will require significant reforms including increasing the predictability of regulation measures are needed to address several challenges particularly in boosting private investment and diversifying exports the wb country director said reform initiatives are also required to continue bangladesh s extraordinary trajectory of reducing extreme poverty which fell from 31 5 percent in 2010 to 24 3 percent in 2017 despite strong progress some of the drivers of poverty reduction appear to be weakening he mentioned in this context bangladesh has shown remarkable generosity in sheltering and providing for the basic needs of nearly one million rohingya in two of the poorest upazilas in cox s bazar saum said the wb report mentioned that bangladesh will require huge investments in physical and human capital and also in innovation to become an upper middle income country by 2031 and achieve high income country status by 2041 any reform effort requires a clear strategy political champions supported by a capable reform team and well established consultation and coordination mechanisms to ensure a high level of coordination among all relevant stakeholders it added
gbx earnings call for the period ending february 28 2019 greenbrier companies inc gbx 1 45 q2 2019 earnings conference call 11 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator hello and welcome to the greenbrier companies second quarter of fiscal year 2019 earnings conference call following today s presentation we will conduct a question and answer session each analyst should limit themselves to only two questions until that time all lines will be in a listen only mode at the request of the greenbrier companies this conference call is being recorded for instant replay purposes at this time i d like to turn over the conference over to mr justin roberts vice president and treasurer mr roberts you may begin justin m roberts vice president corporate finance treasurer thank you angela good morning welcome to our second quarter conference call on today s call i m joined by greenbrier s chairman and ceo bill furman lorie tekorius executive vice president and coo and adrian downes senior vice president and acting cfo they will discuss the results for the quarter and provide an outlook for greenbrier s business in fiscal 2019 following our introductory remarks we will open up the call for questions in addition to the press release issued this morning which includes supplemental data additional financial information and key metrics can be found in a slide presentation posted today on the ir section of our website matters discussed on today s conference call include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 throughout our discussion today we will describe some of the important factors that could cause greenbrier s actual results in 2019 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of greenbrier and with that i ll ask bill to take it away william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors okay thank you very much justin and good morning everyone highlights of greenbrier s second fiscal quarter included solid railcar order activity and increased railcar deliveries and revenue generation but our financial performance in the quarter was obviously disappointing our 2019 plan indemnified our second quarter as the least profitable of the year due in part to expected manufacturing inefficiencies from production line changeovers and building of a fleet of cars for syndication however we also encountered three distinct headwinds mentioned in our press release that impacted profitability in the quarter specifically challenges in manufacturing at our romanian and gunderson facilities and facility closure costs and railcar repair operations these factors caused second quarter earnings per share to fall short of our goals despite these challenges during the quarter our projected deliveries and revenue for the year remain on target however we now estimate fiscal 2019 earnings per share in the range of 3 60 to 3 80 excluding the railcar contract loss accruals and facility closure costs incurred during the quarter adrian will discuss our second quarter financial results and full year financial guidance in more detail while lower than our previous outlook we are confident in greenbrier s ability to perform within this range we have identified the core issues creating the negative financial performance in our romanian facilities in particular in our gunderson operations in our railcar repair network by far the romanian operations were the most significant and we believe we have a new handle on that with new management under the leadership of longtime greenbrier officer william glenn who used to run our european operations and has recently rejoined the company we are also making rapid progress in addressing other performance issues that impacted the quarter i ll briefly offer observations on the current conditions we see in the market and potential impact to our business recent macroeconomic data in the case of the us economy is still growing at a slightly phase in excess of 2 2 of gdp real growth core inflation remains low at approximately 2 and the us federal reserve is projecting no interest rate hikes in 2019 and continues to signal cautiously into 2020 overall low inflation and less restrictive monetary policy in the united states and north america should allow for gdp expansion throughout the balance of the year into 2020 and possibly into 2021 throughout march north american rail traffic is down year over year this is in part due to harsh winter weather conditions and declines in some commodity areas although car loadings are down intermodal activity remains fairly constant from 2018 levels and train velocity continues to be negative greenbrier continues to and part of that is due of course to weather and flooding greenbrier continues to closely monitor the rollout of precision scheduled railroading also known as psr at various class 1 railroads while this is not a new initiative and is not being implemented by all railroads it is a trend that merits attention and we re tracking it closely it has both potential negatives and potential positives to car builders and leasing companies although greenbrier is not presently experiencing any direct impact from psr we put to act on any effects it may produce over time in the railroad equipment and services market one of our defining characteristics is the ability to navigate shifting market dynamics with responsive products and services and to address issues when they arise so we hope to get past this quarter and begin a more normalized performance pattern our strategy of reinforcing the core north american market is succeeding with almost all fiscal 2019 production slots filled and moving into 2020 our integrated team is working to fulfill and fill those in europe customer inquiries remained solid greenbrier astrarail is in active negotiations with several railcar fleet owners for multi year orders there has also been considerable activity in the intermodal sector in europe in part driven by the availability of eu funds designed to take container traffic off the roads to help the continent meet its ambitious carbon reduction goals finally in brazil the economy gained momentum in february after a pause during the presidential transition during fiscal 2019 we focused on strategically reorganizing size with manufacturers so facilities there operate as part of our greenbrier maxion joint venture we believe we re well positioned as a gradual economic recovery and the grants our rail concessions takes hold in this year our long term view of the opportunity in brazil remains very positive greenbrier expects a stronger finish to the second half of fiscal 2019 as we have indicated before our strategy is to continue to deliver on the four elements we articulated at the beginning of fiscal 2019 reinforcing our core north american markets executing on our international strategy although we believe that footprint will be stabilized and not be expanding we won t be emphasizing additional growth other than those things that we ve announced robust development number three of the talent pipeline and continuing to grow the business at a larger scale with that i ll turn it back to laurie and justin lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer thank you bill good morning everyone i ll briefly provide some more detail on our operating performance before adrian addresses the financial detail we delivered 5 100 railcar units and received orders for approximately 3 800 units valued at nearly 450 million orders in the quarter were for a broad range of car types including covered hoppers automotive carrying railcars and tank cars our diversified backlog as of quarter end totaled 26 000 units with an estimated value of 2 7 billion as bill mentioned and as detailed in our press releases of today and march 22nd challenges in romania gunderson and our railcar repair operations negatively impacted results in the quarter by 0 29 per share which includes 0 14 related to loss accruals on certain railcar contracts and facility closure costs with about 95 of 2019 production booked manufacturing execution is critical and we believe we ve identified the right solutions to achieve our updated performance targets in the second half of the year i ll now give a bit more color on those solutions first in europe as bill said effective february 1st william glenn rejoined greenbrier as the ceo of greenbrier astrarail our integrated european rail operation with facilities in romania poland and turkey william initially joined greenbrier in 2003 and over 13 years at greenbrier he held several executive positions in both north america and europe william s familiarity with greenbrier its european operations which recently doubled in size and its expertise and operational turnaround will expedite the required changes in europe in his new role william directs all european strategic and commercial activity and he ll work closely with martin graham our executive vice president of manufacturing who adds chief operating officer of greenbrier astrarail to his responsibilities together william and martin have a mandate to improve operating profitability in greenbrier europe second at gunderson we expect operational and financial improvement at gunderson as we restart our railcar production line and eliminate the distraction of production automation activities and hit our stride in marine where in january we received an order from overseas shipholding group osg to construct the second 204 000 barrel oil and chemical atb barge and lastly in repair since we regained direct control of our north american railcar repair shops in september we ve been strategically reviewing the network at unprofitable locations we first focused our efforts on improving the volume and mix of work after this if we determined that a location cannot be profitable we explore the sale to another operator before reaching a final determination to cease operations in the second quarter after ensuring fair treatment was given to our employees we announced plans to conclude operations at two repair locations and although the repair site evaluation continues we are optimistic about the progress we ve made in rationalizing our network and intend to achieve significantly improved operating performance by the end of 2019 beyond the challenges presented in the quarter there were several positives to share leasing revenue was particularly strong resulting from a substantial uptick in syndication activity and to meet syndication demand some of this product was sourced from outside of our own manufacturing operations excluding those products gross margin in leasing and services exceeded 51 also in the second quarter greenbrier management services our proprietary rail management provider grew its customer base with seven new customers under contract while securing several multi year renewals from existing customers wheels and parts were also positive contributors to greenbrier s performance as bill mentioned winter weather slowed railcar loadings but it was a tailwind to our wheels business one third of our wheels locations operated on a seven day schedule through the winter months to meet high demand our parts group also delivered a strong quarter led by the production of boxcar doors from our ohio facility and continued demand for end of car cushioning units from our iowa operations moving beyond our north american and european operations brazil remains a challenging environment but the economy is improving and with our joint venture partners amsted rail and iochpe maxion we ve sized our operations to be poised to respond when rail demand improves greenbrier continues to pursue opportunities to achieve growth at scale we endeavor to do this for scale actuates the other elements of our strategy and reinforcing the company s position in core north american markets executing in international railcar markets and growing our talent pipeline for the future although we encountered obstacles in the second quarter everything we faced is addressable and solutions are under way to achieve the goals for 2019 and beyond our team is dedicated to meeting our objectives and we continue to be excited about what the future holds for greenbrier adrian i ll turn it over to you to talk about the quarterly financials and our full year guidance adrian j downes senior vice president chief accounting officer acting chief financial officer thank you lorie and good morning everyone quarterly financial information and metrics are available in the press release and supplemental slides on our website given the discussion so far i ll focus on a few additional details in the quarter and then provide additional information on our fiscal year 2019 guidance highlights for the second quarter include net earnings attributable to greenbrier of 2 8 million or 0 08 per share including 4 7 million net of tax or 0 14 per share of railcar contract loss accruals and manufacturing and closure costs and repair operations adjusted ebitda of 37 4 million included 7 6 million of an impact from the contract loss accruals and closure costs revenue was 658 7 million up 9 sequentially almost 30 of our 5 100 units delivered were outside the north american market internally produced syndication activity accounted for another 1 200 units delivered in the quarter 10 to 15 of the order activity in the quarter was from international markets orders continue to be broad based across a variety of railcar types and customers aggregate gross margin of 8 2 was below our expectations as a result of the factors already mentioned as we move beyond the production disruptions in the second quarter we expect gross margins to move back into the double digits during the second half of the year we continue to be focused on growing the business and remain optimistic about the opportunities supported by our balance sheet strengths and flexibility available liquidity of almost 900 million including over 340 million of cash position us well to support our strategic objective to grow at scale i m going to spend a few extra minutes discussing the working capital growth that has occurred over the last two quarters much of which is driven by increasing business activity levels inventory balances increased reflecting preparation for substantially higher expected production rates in the second half of fiscal 2019 as well as the outsourcing of lining work on several car types this has increased the length of time to produce cars meaning they re staying in inventory longer than is typical and this will reverse in the fourth quarter as additional internal lining capacity is brought online all else being equal we expect cash balances to exceed 500 million by the end of the year we continue to focus on activities that emphasize cash flow generation and return on capital employed we believe this approach will continue to create long term shareholder value supported by our history of steady dividend increases over the last several years we are confident in our dividend policy and the 0 25 per share quarterly dividend announced today is our 20th consecutive quarterly dividend and represents a yield of over 3 based on current business trends we are updating our fiscal 2019 guidance deliveries should be approximately 24 000 to 26 000 units which includes about 2 000 units from greenbrier maxion in brazil revenue will exceed 3 billion diluted eps of 3 60 to 3 80 excluding the 0 14 per share related to railcar contract loss accrual and closure costs in q2 our updated earnings guidance reflects the impact of q2 as well as somewhat lowered earnings expectations for the balance of the year in the affected operations the majority of our prior guidance is unchanged operating cash flow will be positive and given the earnings trajectory we will be weighted to the back end of the year g a expense of 205 million to 210 million includes continued support for strategic initiatives including investments in our talent base we will continue to rebalance our lease fleet and expect gains on sale of about 40 million on 120 million of proceeds from those sales similar to 2018 we intend to continue adding to our fleet with expected investments of about 100 million we expect capital expenditures of 105 million in manufacturing and wheels repair and parts combined with our fleet activity our net capital expenditure will be about 75 million depreciation and amortization is expected to be 80 million to 85 million and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates are expected to be breakeven to modestly positive in 2019 we expect 2019 earnings attributable to non controlling interest to be about 40 million and our consolidated tax rate for 2019 is expected to be 25 to 26 our rate will fluctuate due to the geographic mix of earnings and other discrete items operator we ll now open it up for questions operator we ll now open it up for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from justin long with stephens your line is open justin long stephens analyst thanks and good morning so i wanted to start with a question on the 7 6 million charge that you called out can you share how much of that was allocated to the wheels and parts segment and how much of that was allocated to the manufacturing segment and then just thinking about manufacturing margins is there a way to size up the operational headwind that you saw from europe and gunderson just curious if there s a way to quantify what that was in the quarter william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors yeah so the the closure costs in our repair business was 1 1 million so the other items related to manufacturing at 6 5 million so the bulk of that was in manufacturing lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer and justin could you repeat the rest of your question sorry i got a little bit lost justin long stephens analyst sure no problem second part was just on the operational headwinds in europe and gunderson and if there was any way to call out what that impact was as we think about a more normalized margin going forward lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer right so i would say that we did have headwinds beyond what we talked about on the job loss accruals we have some definite inefficiencies in both europe and gunderson that are part of the larger number that we called out in the earnings release you ve been through our shops you know that these things don t necessarily turn on a dime but we didn t wait until the quarter finished to start making adjustments so we ve had activities under way and we expect modest improvement in the third quarter and even better improvement in the fourth justin long stephens analyst okay and then for my second question i wanted to circle back to a comment that you made bill that you won t be emphasizing growth in some of the international markets beyond what you ve already announced can you just comment on your longer term view of the international businesses i m curious if your opinion on the earnings power or margin potential in those international businesses has changed or is this just simply a case where the processes in europe aren t where they need to be and now you ve changed management and we should see the issues resolved pretty quickly william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors i ll just simply with regard to international strategy we believe that it will ultimately result in diversity of revenue and earnings by having footprints in different locations however given the nature of the hit in europe and the disappointments there we need to regroup and ensure that we have all of that under control we re also working carefully in brazil the gcc and turkey which has really small footprint right now we think that it s best to consolidate our activities and have a strong profitable base before we do more to expand those are the regions where we are currently operating so i think that answers both aspects of your question adrian j downes senior vice president chief accounting officer acting chief financial officer and justin we did call out 0 29 of performance issues at those units that did include loss contract accruals as well as the closure costs justin m roberts vice president corporate finance treasurer yeah not at all the units i mentioned but just in europe the gunderson facility and then the continuing assimilation of the shop network at within our wheels and parts group but it s the repair business the actual wheel and parts business as lorie mentioned offset some of that in the repair side justin long stephens analyst okay that s helpful and one just last quick modeling question on incentive comp could you comment on how that assumption has changed versus your prior forecast william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors our incentive comp goes down if our expectations go down and lorie can probably give more precise figure justin or answer to that lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer i think that thought on is yes as our results decline our incentive compensation declines we also the incentive compensation is expensed pro rata consistent with when we have quarters of earnings so we would expect higher if the back half is going to have higher earnings it will have higher expense justin long stephens analyst okay but there is not a dollar amount that you can share that in terms of the change from prior guidance to the guidance you gave today lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer no not at this time justin long stephens analyst okay fair enough i ll leave it at that i appreciate the time justin m roberts vice president corporate finance treasurer thank you justin operator our next question comes from matt elkott with cowen your line is open william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors good morning matt elkott cowen analyst good morning how are you guys first i have just a maintenance question on the guidance i want make sure i got this right did you guys say that the net gain on disposition of equipment guidance was unchanged at around 40 million william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors that s correct matt elkott cowen analyst okay so the second half should be lower because the first half if you annualize it would be closer to 52 million william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors exactly yes the q3 and q4 will be at a lower run rate matt elkott cowen analyst okay that s very helpful my next question is based on your expected deliveries for the second half the 95 that s already in the backlog i think you will be left with just over 11 000 units beyond fiscal 2019 so how much of that or what percentage of that is for 2020 or beyond and based on the current order activity and the delivery schedules do you think 2020 could be an eps growth year lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer we always seek to have the next year be an eps growth year regarding where we sit right now on backlog and how our production space is filled into 2020 we re feeling good but we re also in the rail freight business so we never feel really good our guys are working hard every day to fill that space we do have some orders that continue into 2021 i don t think any beyond 2021 maybe just a little bit but i would say the bulk of the backlog that goes from out of 2019 is in 2020 with a little bit going into 2021 and 2022 it s hard for me to think about years that big matt elkott cowen analyst okay and lorie how has the order and inquiry activity been since the end of the quarter william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors since the end of the quarter we continue to see a lot of visibility in various tank car markets plastics and other derivative products we are also seeing a strong demand in some commodity types inaudible for example a little weaker demand in some car types but in general we think we have very good momentum into 2020 and even some visibility as lorie mentioned into 2021 matt elkott cowen analyst okay so on the tank car front bill you mentioned i guess the tank car outlook continues to be pretty positive or have you seen any recent signs that customers are maybe having second thoughts on pulling the trigger on those orders and also what are the manufacturing lead times for tank cars william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors the lead times are anywhere from six to 12 months depending on the type we haven t seen a lot of hesitation but i would suggest that we don t want to confuse the mix and i think it s all crude by rail there is a broad tank car segment that has a lot of activity going on in it matt elkott cowen analyst okay do you have a sense of how much of the tank car activity is for replacement of older tank cars versus new demand william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors i think that s a significant factor matt elkott cowen analyst okay william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors but i already have a statistic to share matt elkott cowen analyst great very helpful thank you very much william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors thank you matt matt elkott cowen analyst thanks matt operator our next question comes from allison poliniak with wells fargo your line is open allison poliniak wells fargo analyst hi guys good morning laurie i wanted to go back i think you were talking about automation and some of the issues that you had in the quarter can you just give us your high level thoughts as automation is just not a process it s going to work and railcar manufacturing is it something that you re reworking to go back any thoughts there lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer right so allison thank you for that question no we are firmly embracing automation in all of our facilities mexico and in north america manufacturing as well as our aftermarkets business where we can look at ways that we can deploy automation to improve the quality improve efficiencies in our shop and it actually gives our employees an opportunity to learn how to work the automation so it s not just the focus on trying to eliminate headcount so if i misspoke during my prepared remarks what i intended to say is that it was a distraction at gunderson it s not that it didn t work or that we re stepping away from it but it s just cost management to be a bit distracted with their time william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors and i just add that we have about 20 people in a team that continues to work on automation and that particular project which was for key sub assembly on the cars we are replacing chinese content with north american content we are intending to replace that sub assembly at gunderson the supplier we chose and the execution on the job didn t work out to our expectations and we had to regroup but we are going to continue with the gunderson facility particularly to automate as appropriate and it s highly appropriate in that setting allison poliniak wells fargo analyst okay that s helpful and then so you touched on psr to some extent i think everybody is very familiar with the negative impact of cars but you did say there are positives could you maybe expand on that a little bit william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors yeah the psr is different things to different railroads different things to different people for some shippers it s a very big negative and i think for the railroad industry in particular if they lose touch with the shipper community it could cause low back as inaudible has mentioned that bnsf is not entirely has not been a great subscriber to psr as it relates to the effect on the customer base of potential regulation that it might bring in the future we all operate through customers and if we can t have if we don t have customers and we concentrate only on internal metrics that particularly are short term it can damage the long term franchise value of the business i think that there is a great debate going on among railroad operating people and yes we re certainly seeing efficiencies rising at union pacific through psr and other railroads but it s leaving some of the shippers looking at other ways to call their freight and some of those other ways can be through creative programs that can benefit leasing companies and car builders as they aggregate demand in the north american network adrian j downes senior vice president chief accounting officer acting chief financial officer bill if i could add just one other point on to that for companies that are innovative that have strong engineering departments like greenbrier we have ph three of introducing new more efficient railcar designs and that is attractive to companies that are implementing psr william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors exactly allison poliniak wells fargo analyst got it and are you starting to see some of that sort of those increase come in at this point william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors we ve been working with several of these customers over the last several quarters and i would be the short answer is yes allison poliniak wells fargo analyst great thanks so much operator our next question comes from bascome majors with susquehanna your line is open bascome majors susquehanna financial group analyst hey thanks for taking my questions here you talked a little about growing the business acquisitively you re adding some verticals domestically can you talk a little bit about what kinds of business you re not in in north america that you d like to get in or what you could use to supplement the existing portfolio adrian j downes senior vice president chief accounting officer acting chief financial officer our management services business has grown from 10 million a year in ebitda to 25 million a year in ebitda over the last several years of last 10 years and that s a significant number we think that that business is crucial for business and we like that business since it s essential to our syndication and leasing and manufacturing strategy so we are internally growing that business we also think that finding core businesses i have those are the areas we re concentrating on for growth i m not sure we said that we where well i obviously leave it at that lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer and i would say i would add on to that right with the technology our management services afford us and we touched over 200 000 of the north of 300 000 adrian j downes senior vice president chief accounting officer acting chief financial officer 300 00 0 yeah lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer cars in the north american fleet so we have access to a lot of information and by using technology to think i think about things like preventative maintenance ways that we can help to service our customers better is how we think about how we might vertically integrate or integrate across our existing lines of business bascome majors susquehanna financial group analyst okay i apologize i took the comments about not looking to grow the footprint about as a signal that there were some capital deployment opportunities domestically to grow the business acquisitively william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors well we re not saying that there we re not denying that we have a very strong balance sheet and if we can employ the capital at a double digit rate of return obviously that would be the best thing for shareholders in addition to dividends we think there are opportunities in the core business to do that all i intended to say is that we want to be sure that our international businesses are on strong footing so we have some work to do in europe for the next couple of quarters to put that ship right on the water bascome majors susquehanna financial group analyst i think it s a good segue to the next question here i mean it sounds like you ve got some challenges that gunderson certainly some challenges in eastern europe but the core mexico manufacturing operation is performing pretty well here and you seem pretty confident in the profit and cash flow outlook for at least the next two or three quarters here looking back you haven t bought your share since 2016 stocks down almost 50 in the last six months trades at a pretty significant discount to some of your peers in the place you ve got 100 million buyback plan in place why wouldn t now be the time to act more aggressively on your own stock is that a good place to allocate capital today william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors our board looks at capital allocation every quarter we on that subject we have robust conversations i think as the balance of this fiscal year plays out you ll see us take some definite steps on capital allocation we always are looking at trade off between dividends and stock buybacks in terms of return and total shareholder return but and i wouldn t comment further beyond that but we are very focused on capital allocation and we definitely discuss this at our board meeting every time we have one bascome majors susquehanna financial group analyst okay fair enough thanks for the time guys william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors thank you bascome lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer thank you bascome operator our next question comes from steve barger with keybanc capital markets your line is open steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst hi good morning everybody lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer good morning steve steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst you talked about getting cash balance back to 500 million by year end as working capital versus but i m curious of the net impact of the international businesses will be positive or negative free cash flow this year william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors that s a good question lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer that is an excellent question i would say that william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors should we talk about hope or should we talk about inaudible lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer i believe what our forecast currently show is that will be modestly positive but they won t be the vast majority of what driving our free cash flow that will be the north american market steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst and do you feel like you have visibility as you go into next year to see a positive reversal there or is that kind of a longer term ramp to seeing those international businesses be free cash flow contributors lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer well bill regularly tells me i m not allowed to have feelings but yes i believe i believe that we will continue to see as the operations improve we expect to see that flow through to operating cash flow as well william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors just a little color on that the thing that happened in europe was and i bear some responsibility here we rely heavily on european management we do have a controlled supervisory board but we made some bad decisions in particular we ve been buffeted by supply problems over there inaudible brakes for example in europe has gone through a recent reorganization and management buyout or private equity buyout things have really gotten bad there they have virtually a monopoly we re going to seek regulatory intervention because they ve been very slow to provide not just to us but to other builders and repair facilities the necessary brake systems and they failed in their responsibility in that regard so these issues are being addressed and i think that s the one that lingers but we are accepting orders we tried to put 10 pounds and 5 pound bag through the enthusiasm of the local group i think that we will have a more disciplined and orderly input of orders there so we will take orders that are profitable and we will also avoid the state owned enterprises that put penalties which can and sometimes be addressed by fortunately europe so i think we have a much better prospect we exactly understand what happened and we know what to do about it and i feel confident that by the fourth quarter we ll see huge risk reversal of headwinds to tailwinds there steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst got it that s good detail thanks and bill just to clarify your earlier comments on demand levels for railcars have inquiry to order conversions remained steady with what you were seeing last year domestically and internationally william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors yes steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst good and justin can you clarify the comment on how new car designs specifically go to benefit psr justin m roberts vice president corporate finance treasurer so if you go into a customer let s call it a class 1 railroad 10 years ago and you would have said we can take six feet out of a railcar and still maintain the heated capacity you may or may not have had much of an audience if you go into a path right now and say the same thing they re very interested in understanding how they can put more railcars into a train and carry more cubic capacities steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst got it ok and last one from me it s probably too early to talk about this but if we do get into an order slowdown and deliveries were to decline next year what are the mitigation plans for the manufacturing footprint to minimize detrimental margins william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors two significant ones that we are implementing in a test case in brazil rightsizing factories to stabilize the workforce and to improve margins by not going after market share only brazil is a very interesting country where there are only two car builders for example we are the have the largest market share but i think we re running we have been running brazil with too many workers for the volume that can be obtained at the current levels when and if in north america we see the next decline and certainly will be when not if this flexible footprint that we have in mexico where we can size the factories quite quickly needs to be expanded extended to gunderson it needs to be extended and used actively in europe because you can end up putting the cart before the horse having a facility is too large and then competing for orders that are not truly profitable because you re simply supporting the workforce i think it s easy for a car builder if you re not paying attention to drift into that and that s a primary thing that we are doing i think the second point just is that half of our facilities or more than half in north america are highly flexible and we can add and deduct employees pretty easily in the united states it s harder because all manufacturers all businesses are coping with the change in demographic in the workforce and i think we have to look at not adding and deducting in united states but rather a stable workforce base and then just going after the business that will support that base steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst understood thanks for the time william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors thank you operator our next question comes from matt brooklier with buckingham research your line is open matt brooklier buckingham research analyst yes thanks and good morning no it s kind of a smaller part of your manufacturing business but can you talk about how much revenue you booked at marine during the fiscal second quarter and maybe a little bit more color on where the backlog currently sits justin m roberts vice president corporate finance treasurer bill now this is justin the marine revenue in the quarter was between 10 million to 15 million probably closer to 10 million and we expect it to ramp up to a more sustainable range of around kind of 15 million in the for the next several quarters with the two large barges we received orders for from osg we ve got visibility extending deep into calendar 2020 at this point william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors the other thing about marine though is it can t be measured by the size of the revenue it absorbs by its nature of its business it absorbs a great deal of overhead at the facility so the economics of that business combined with railcars there creates a different dynamic so marine business is very important part of gunderson we see we had pretty good visibility out into 2021 in that business with two barges we ve got and the other things in the pipeline matt brooklier buckingham research analyst okay so it sounds like part of the gunderson margin improvement story is partially related to work ramping up on the marine side and getting more of the fixed cost absorption william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors exactly got it matt brooklier buckingham research analyst yeah and then if you talk a little bit about it kind of the cadence of earnings in the second half of this year maybe talk to the expectations for deliveries on what s left as i look at what s you ve delivered year to date sales and use the midpoint of your guidance ex brazil right we re talking about 14 300 cars in the past you ve talked about maybe percentages of when we should anticipate kind of the magnitude of deliveries but just a little bit more color on the deliveries i think would be helpful thanks william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors you will see a meaningful step up in q3 and then another meaningful step up in q4 i would say that it s probably maybe a 20 increase roughly in q3 and then another maybe 10 to 15 increase in q4 part of this is that again as we ve been saying this fiscal year q2 was positioning us to increase our production rate in the back half of the year that is already occurring and we will be stabilizing in q3 with our run rate exiting in q4 matt brooklier buckingham research analyst okay lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer the other thing that i would the other thing i would add on to that justin that we ve talked about which has been a consumer cash flow that we do have a number of assets on the balance sheet that we expect to syndicate in the third and fourth quarters so you ll see additional volume there matt brooklier buckingham research analyst got it okay thank you for the color william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors thank you operator our next question comes from ken hoexter with bank of america merrill lynch ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey bill if i could just revisit your prior answer there the flexibility in the us on your cost side and europe versus mexico i mean just simply because of unionization it s going to be much more difficult to flex in i d like to understand your versus mexico is that what you were saying where you have much more flexibility william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors no it s actually the opposite we are not unionized in gunderson and we are unionized in mexico but the unions and nature of unions in mexico are not exactly like they are in united states so that you can add or deduct workers but what i meant to say just in simple terms is we re going to try to size the facilities to the market we re going to try to produce to work on a sustained volume that will fit the size of those facilities what we used to do and what railcar builders used to do is if they had a surge of business they ve gotten higher a lot of new employees and then if the surge as the surge past they would lay off workers i don t think anyone in this environment and probably in the foreseeable future looking at demographics of age and work preference will be able to afford to do that or that it s a sustainable model i think instead we focus on a flexible workforce with some contract workers you will have a core set of highly trained people you will retain and you will put business in different facilities into more flexible facilities where you can add or deduct labor so i think that i ve seen this all around not just us but other builders too where when you are trying to increase the workforce and then decrease it rapidly it creates all kinds of pain and sorrow safety statistics decline safety is one of our most important is our most important priority and you also have a real impact on quality reliability and it s just that things have changed in the workforce we can t do it the way we used to do so what we re doing is getting a core facility with a core fleet of work and trying to make that work more profitable with higher margins that means that like precision railroading we re going to turn away some customers that have been used to buying very cheaply relative to other car types or other customers ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst great great clarification thanks for that then let me keep on the cost side just for one more on sg a you had a big up quarter last quarter down slightly year over year this quarter maybe on a lower if you have any thoughts on spending is that a lever based on kind of market demand and as you flow or maybe kind of just thoughts on the sg a side lorie l tekorius executive vice president chief operating officer sure ken i think we touched a little bit on the fact that we would expect sg a to step up a bit in the second half of the year just from an incentive compensation perspective so because we record those expenses as we generate the earnings now if we can t do everything that we ve been trying to explain to you guys that we plan to do in the second half inaudible occur we don t have any other that jump to mind significant movements and what would be driving sg a to be materially different from kind of taking let s say an average of the first half of 2019 ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and then lastly for me just to follow up on allison s question bill you mentioned the kind of positives on psr can you talk about the other side have you had any orders that got eliminated i mean if not more than half the group that s jumped on it in the past call it six months with inaudible has there been a change of order process through that through your discussions william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors i think justin more or less nailed it specifically on the design service design aspect of a freight car we and at least one other builder have really advanced the art there and it s not it s probably not rocket science but that s been a big plus and on the negative side it hasn t affected us yet we have we are closely watching velocity there is of course an issuing in velocity right now because of the floods as soon as we have more normalized weather i think we ll be able to have a better understanding probably by the next quarter but we haven t really seen our order book or order throughput affected adversely we have to keep in mind further that shippers are a large part of the customer base to sign these railroads railroads are they own fewer cars than shippers and leasing companies combined and if you cannot take gas as a leasing operation i guess in north america ph and the world it that s where the action is so it affects shippers adversely psr does in some cases and positively in other cases so it is a little bit of a complex thing and it varies by railroad railroad by railroad and how it s getting implemented some are doing it very well some of them they are basically just cutting costs and cutting service and that doesn t sit well with a lot of shippers some of the shippers may either go to ph ot5s as derivatives allow them and run their own cars which creates demand or they might go to trucks or they might go to the stb and complain which we believe they will do depending on how harsh this environment is yes ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst and just i guess on that the crude order from alberta do that will stay in in canada or did some of that come to the manufacturing market in the us william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors i think ken that some was in canada and some was in the which are awarded to us stockholders ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay hi thanks for the time and thoughts appreciate it william a furman chief executive officer president chairman of the board of directors thank you

economic data will take a backseat in the coming week as the biggest risk events that are being anticipated are the european central bank s policy meeting and an emergency summit by the european union to discuss the brexit crisis but while uk and eu politics may grab most of the headlines there will also be some key releases to keep an eye on export numbers out of china and germany will be watched to assess global trading conditions as trade tensions ease uk monthly gdp figures and us price indicators will also be important while the minutes of the fed s march policy meeting should attract some attention too chinese exports expected to bounce back shipments from china slumped by 20 7 year on year in february fuelling fears that the trade dispute with the us is starting to significantly damage the country s trade prospects however the poor performance was partially attributed to the timing of the lunar new year holiday compared with last year and exports are expected to post a decent rebound in march exports are forecast to have increased by 7 3 y y in march though imports are predicted to have slipped further for a fourth straight month declining by 1 3 y y the trade numbers are due on friday and ahead of that inflation data will be watched with both the consumer price index cpi and produce price index ppi due on thursday the australian dollar is likely to bear the brunt of any shocks in the trade data though markets would possibly see through any negative surprises given the progress being made in the trade negotiations between the us and china in recent weeks japanese machinery orders eyed machinery orders out of japan will be another important gauge for global trade on wednesday core orders a forward looking indicator for capital spending fell by 5 4 y y in january another big drop in february would further darken the outlook for corporate japan a quarterly survey by the bank of japan published earlier this week showed business sentiment deteriorating in the first three months of the year amid a continued slowdown in japan s main trading partners in addition to machinery orders corporate goods prices for march will also be released on wednesday a weak set of figures from japan could act as an additional drag on the yen which has been under pressure this week on the back of improving risk appetite led by growing expectations that the us and china are closing in on a trade deal spotlight on may corbyn talks ahead of emergency eu summit sterling is headed for another rollercoaster week as the brexit crisis shows no sign of abating and the extended deadline for britain to leave the eu looms on april 12 after two rounds of indicative votes for parliament to set the brexit agenda failed to produce a majority on any of the alternative options the uk prime minister theresa may decided to hold talks with the labour opposition leader jeremy corbyn to try and find a way forward that could win labour support may has until april 10 when eu leaders will gather for an emergency summit to reach some sort of an agreement on a revised brexit deal with corbyn if may accepts labour demands for a customs union and a deal is passed the uk would be in a position to leave on may 22 a day before eu member states elect new members of the european parliament but if the two leaders are unable to come to any agreement a longer extension that could involve the uk taking part in the upcoming election would become likely however another extension is not guaranteed as the eu may decide it s had enough of british lawmakers indecisiveness and accept that a crash uk exit may be the only way out from the crisis hence a disorderly brexit cannot be completely ruled out even after uk mps moved swiftly this week to pass a legislation that blocks the government from leaving without a deal and requires it to seek further extensions to article 50 if there is no consensus on the withdrawal agreement the pound is likely to remain choppy within its current range of 1 2950 1 3350 if next week s events don t provide any clarity for investors as to where brexit is headed however if it starts to become inevitable that the uk would have to stay in a customs union in order to break the impasse an upside break above this range would be an easy feat for the pound there could be a more muted response though to a barrage of uk data out on wednesday february numbers on gdp growth industrial and manufacturing output and trade could prove a temporary distraction for traders but with signs that the all important services sector is taking a significant hit from the ongoing brexit uncertainty any weakness in the monthly gdp readings could weigh on sterling ecb to stand pat in april after catching markets off guard by pushing back the projected timing of a rate hike as early as at the march meeting the ecb s april meeting will probably be a quieter affair with no change in policy or the forward guidance expected nevertheless there will still be plenty to keep investors interested the surprise big upward revision in the eurozone s services pmi in march may positively influence policymakers outlook and analysts will be on alert for the possibility of less cautious views on the economy by mario draghi in his post meeting press conference markets will also want to see whether there was any discussion of introducing a tiered system for the ecb s negative deposit rate which has been having a damaging effect on eurozone banks profitability while excluding some banks cash reserves from being charged negative rates would be good for the health of the banking system markets could perceive it as a dovish move as it would indicate a prolonged period of below zero deposit rate the ecb will announce its decision on wednesday and the euro will be on standby for more dovish tilts by the central bank in addition to the policy meeting euro traders will also be watching german february export figures and the eurozone sentix index for april on monday as well as february industrial production numbers for the region on friday us inflation and fed minutes may struggle to excite the dollar the us economic calendar will be one of the busier ones next week though the data may fail to generate much of a response in the forex market factory orders will start the week on monday after managing only meager growth of 0 1 month on month in december and january factory orders are forecast to have reversed course in february to decrease by 0 6 on wednesday attention will shift to the fomc minutes of the march meeting and on inflation as the cpi report is released headline inflation is expected to have accelerated to 1 8 y y in march from 1 5 before while the core rate is forecast to have held steady at 2 1 y y any rise in the cpi rate from current levels is unlikely to alarm the fed especially as their targeted price measure the core pce price index remains contained around 2 the fed will probably reinforce its neutral stance in its march meeting minutes when fomc members signalled they re not planning to raise rates at all in 2019 the language coming from fed policymakers has been fairly consistent in recent months so no surprises are being anticipated from the minutes as a result the us dollar is more likely to be driven by trade headlines and risk sentiment in other data from the us march producer prices will follow on thursday and the university of michigan s preliminary reading of the consumer sentiment index for april will round up the week on friday

series gutting the irs who wins when a crucial agency is defunded propublica is a nonprofit newsroom based in new york sign up for propublica s big story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published on june 30 2016 an auto parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread the internal revenue service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it georg schaeffler faced a 1 2 billion tax bill after his company restructured a huge debt julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court have you been involved in a global high wealth audit if so we d like to hear about your experiences email or on signal at 718 496 5233 but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider charles rettig commissioner of the internal revenue service said if any group were auditing donald trump it would be the global high wealth team aaron p bernstein getty images that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person former irs commissioner steven miller tried to fix the agency s approach to auditing the ultrawealthy nicholas kamm afp getty images the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception get our top investigations subscribe to the big story newsletter taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes loading the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler and his mother maria elisabeth ran into trouble after their family auto parts company acquired tiremaker continental ag in the middle of the financial crisis julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but

government that s good news for corporations and the wealthy
on june 30 2016 an auto parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread the internal revenue service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent the reviews resulted in no additional taxes loading the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall

two governments over oil prices senior saudi officials have discussed a plan to stop invoicing oil in dollars and switch to other currencies if the no oil producing and exporting cartels act nopec recently introduced in congress becomes law the threat has been communicated to top officials in washington and leaked to signal the strength of the kingdom s opposition saudi arabia threatens to ditch dollar oil trades to stop nopec reuters april 5 invoicing oil sales in euros or yuan would aim to damage the us dollar s status as the petro recycling currency and its reserve status more generally weakening its value and taking aim at us financial dominance in practice the threat is not credible since the kingdom relies almost totally on the united states for its security including purchases of armaments and training intelligence sharing and support in its conflict in yemen the kingdom could not afford to jeopardize its security relationship and close ties with the present u s administration but it does illustrate the strain on relations that has emerged between the kingdom and the united states especially the white house over the desirable level of oil prices those tensions are likely to intensify as the united states gears up for congressional and presidential elections in november 2020 price disagreement on most issues saudi arabia s rulers and the white house are more closely aligned than ever before especially in their shared commitment to confronting iran saudi arabia is central to the regional security system the trump administration has been trying to assemble to contain iran s influence in the middle east in turn saudi arabia has become increasingly dependent on the united states for its internal and external security as its conflict with iran escalates both in the diplomatic arena and in wars being fought by proxy in the region the u s and saudi governments need each other on the issue of oil prices however the two disagree sharply president donald trump has made clear he wants oil prices to remain below 70 per barrel in a series of messages posted on twitter and delivered in television interviews saudi arabia by contrast needs prices well over 70 and probably over 80 to shore up its government finances pay for an expensive economic transformation and stem the deterioration in its own balance of payments campaign politics like most first term presidents trump s over riding priority is to be re elected all other policy considerations will be subordinated to that aim other u s officials may pursue various policy priorities but the president s and vice president s names are the only ones on the ballot which puts re election at the forefront of their calculations since the oil shocks of the 1970s gasoline prices have often been a high profile issue in election campaigns and the run up to november 2020 will be no different the president has calculated correctly his marginal voter next year will be a motorist in the midwest so he needs moderately low gasoline prices at least until after election day trump is not the first president who has tried to exert pressure on saudi arabia to lower oil prices in the run up to a vote in 2000 energy secretary bill richardson mounted a very public campaign to press saudi arabia to increase oil output and lower prices u s urges opec to increase oil production new york times sept 7 2000 richardson pressed publicly for output increases and even called up the kingdom s oil minister in the middle of an opec meeting richardson s intervention which irritated the kingdom coincided with the clinton white house s efforts to help the presidential campaign of vice president al gore counter leverage so far nopec bills introduced into the u s house of representatives and senate have made little progress and the administration has adopted a non committal attitude to them if oil prices rise to 80 or more however the bills may start to make more progress through the legislative process as lawmakers respond to pressure from their constituents the higher the prices rise and the nearer election day comes the greater the prospect the nopec legislation will start to move forward at 85 90 congress will take more notice at 90 95 the bill could make it to the president s desk and at 95 100 the president might direct the attorney general to initiate legal proceedings saudi arabia cannot be sure whether the president would sign or veto a nopec bill if it was approved by both chambers and presented to him in fact the president has every incentive to maintain constructive ambiguity since it provides a useful source of leverage to ensure saudi arabia cooperates with his re election effort in circumstances where oil prices are high and rising the president might demand an output increase and lower oil prices in exchange for vetoing the bill nopec is therefore a useful bargaining chip for the white house and the threat to switch invoicing away from the dollar is the kingdom s response an attempt to develop a form of counter leverage more importantly the threat to the dollar s reserve currency status is intended to give the kingdom s lobbyists in washington a talking point to raise with lawmakers and within the administration while the threat may not be credible it is meant to signal the kingdom s concern and is intended to help create a firewall to keep nopec legislation bottled up in congress and as far from the president s desk as possible

1p conventional natural gas reserves decreased 15 to 261 bcf from 307 bcf in the prior year and total proved plus probable 2p conventional natural gas reserves decreased 23 to 293 bcf from 380 bcf in the prior year the decrease is a consequence of 2018 additional gas production of 14 6 bcf lower anticipated forecasted sales and the reduction in the effective ownership interest in the gross property reserves due to the sale of a 7 9 non controlling interest in a subsidiary pae panafrican energy corporation paem described in note 3 to the tables below the net present value of the estimated future cash flows from the 2p reserves at a 10 discount rate npv10 decreased by 10 0 to us 294 4 million from us 326 1 million in the previous year the decrease is predominately the result of recognizing the non controlling interest in the dividend stream from paem in arriving at the present value and the decline in the forecast sales being offset by the removal of the ssn 1 well from the future development costs in the 2p life of licence valuation additional gas production in 2018 was 14 6 bcf equivalent to 39 9 mmcf day down 4 from 2017 due primarily to the reduced nominations of

act repeals earlier legislation provides a regulatory framework over upstream mid stream and downstream gas activity and as well consolidates and puts in place a single effective and comprehensive legal framework for regulating the oil and gas industry in the country the act also provides for the creation of an upstream regulator the petroleum upstream regulatory authority pura the mid and downstream petroleum as well as gas activities are proposed to be regulated by the current authority the energy and water utilities regulatory authority ewura the act also confers upon on the tanzanian petroleum development corporation tpdc the status of the national oil company mandated with the task of managing the country s commercial interest in the petroleum operations as well as mid and downstream natural gas activities the act vests tpdc with exclusive rights in the entire petroleum upstream value chain and the natural gas mid and downstream value chain however the exclusive rights of tpdc do not extend to mid and downstream petroleum supply operations the company is uncertain regarding the potential impact on its business in tanzania the act does provide grandfathering provisions upholding the rights of the company under the production sharing agreement as it was signed prior to the passing of the act however it is still unclear how the provisions of the act will be interpreted and implemented regarding upstream and downstream activities on october 7 2016 the government of tanzania issued the petroleum natural gas pricing regulation natural gas pricing regulation made under sections 165 and 258 i of the act article 260 3 preserves the company s pre existing right with tpdc to market and sell additional gas together or independently on terms and conditions including prices negotiated with third party natural gas customers the impact of the natural gas pricing regulation cannot be determined at this time on january 16 2018 orca sold the swala transaction

misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead as the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion on a 6 1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value

your inbox as soon as they are published on june 30 2016 an auto parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread the internal revenue service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it georg schaeffler faced a 1 2 billion tax bill after his company restructured a huge debt julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court have you been involved in a global high wealth audit if so we d like to hear about your experiences email or on signal at 718 496 5233 but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider charles rettig commissioner of the internal revenue service said if any group were auditing donald trump it would be the global high wealth team aaron p bernstein getty images that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person former irs commissioner steven miller tried to fix the agency s approach to auditing the ultrawealthy nicholas kamm afp getty images the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception get our top investigations subscribe to the big story newsletter taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes loading the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler and his mother maria elisabeth ran into trouble after their family auto parts company acquired tiremaker continental ag in the middle of the financial crisis julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled in the refinancing the banks and schaeffler had agreed to split the company s debt which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money in short it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction the junior debt was another matter and its provisions would raise the hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know when they d receive it or even if they would ever get anything to the irs these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person the irs efforts to police the superwealthy have been a bust michael brochstein sopa images lightrocket via getty images in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery the schaeffler group s business rebounded despite a recent dip in the car market things have turned out ok for georg schaeffler today forbes estimates his fortune at over 13 billion

business news padraig o huiginn honoured at the business finance fs 50 launch 2013 senior civil servant and businessman had a fifty year career in the civil service before retiring in 1993 and moving into the private sector pádraig ó huiginn entered the civil service in 1941 and served for over fifty years where he was innovative in his endeavours to progress social and economical change and to capture and utilise opportunities for the benefit of all he retired in 1993 after postponing retirement twice and moved into the private sector his name is synonymous with high profile projects such as the ifsc temple bar and the irish museum of modern art imma but he is perhaps best remembered for his role as secretary general of the department of the taoiseach a position he held from 1982 1993 in addition to his secretary general role ó huiginn also served as economic affairs officer un economic commission in geneva was officer in charge of housing planning and building at the un headquarters in new york and was director for regional policy and deputy director general for energy science and technology at the ec council of ministers in brussels after he left the civil service he experienced success in the private sector most notably through his involvement as a director of denis o brien s esat telecom which was taken over by british telecom in 2000 to mark his passing we release this interview between pádraig ó huiginn and business finance publisher ian hyland from ireland inc a history of irish business in 2017 padraig o huiginn in conversation with ian hyland from ireland inc a history of irish business the former secretary general of the department of an taoiseach discusses the ifsc economic recovery and working closely with charles haughey pádraig ó huiginn is among the most prominent civil servants in recent irish history he spent five decades in the public sector before retirement in 1993 rising to serve as secretary general of the department of an taoiseach between 1982 and his retirement he is perhaps best remembered for his close working relationship with the former taoiseach charles haughey and played a prominent role in one of the most successful public private partnerships in the history of the state the international financial services centre ifsc in dublin s docklands in the late 1980s from school to the civil service pádraig ó huiginn went to school at st finbarr s college in cork from school he went straight to the civil service although he subsequently completed a master s in economic and social planning at the university of edinburgh when ó huiginn achieved first place in the administrative officer exam he was assigned to the department of local government when the government of which john costello was taoiseach was elected soon afterwards i was assigned to a special task he remembers the government if elected had committed itself to abolishing the city and county management system the secretary of the department john garvin suggested to the new minister mr o donnell that before deciding what to do he should go around the country and meet all city and county councillors and the chairpersons of urban councils to see what they thought of the proposal to abolish the management system the minister agreed and i was given the task of arranging all those meetings attending them and noting the views of councillors when the meetings which went on over a number of months were over the secretary asked me to report on the views of councillors and make any proposals i thought should be considered i wrote a very short report to the effect that councillors generally did not want the management system removed as they were part time politicians and had businesses and jobs to look after and could not do the work of managers their basic complaint was that managers paid little or no attention to their views i suggested that to correct this situation councillors should be given the power by a two thirds majority to direct a manager to perform a managerial function in the way they wanted i argued that this would make the managers consult councillors more for fear of their two thirds majority power the secretary accepted this proposal as did the minister and the government and the law was amended to give the two thirds majority power to councillors this forced managers to consult more fully with councillors and the dissatisfaction of councillors with the system disappeared local government has functioned now for over 60 years under that revised system which as a young junior civil servant i suggested international adventures ó huiginn worked at the united nations first in geneva and then in new york between 1956 and 1964 when i worked at the un in geneva i published a study on housing he recalls in it i mentioned that rents in social housing should be sufficient to give funds to keep social housing in good repair the russian delegates wanted me to delete this recommendation but i refused two months later khrushchev announced that he was adopting my recommendation by increasing rents so as to provide funds to keep social housing in good repair pádraig ó huiginn recalls the background to tk whitaker s economic development and the first programme for economic expansion considered by many to be the biggest factor in shaping the modern industrial economy the industrial development authority ida had been set up in the preceding decade and an inflow of foreign direct investment was feeding through to economic activity he says before fianna fáil took office in march 1957 whitaker had complained we were spending too much on social investment particularly housing he wasn t correct we were spending proportionately more but it wasn t that we were spending too much it was that we weren t spending enough on economic investment when the fianna fáil government came in he wrote the economic plan which emphasised much the same and money was then found for the investment which had been lacking in the previous time it was one of the reasons the government fell because there was no money yet when the fianna fáil government came in money was found joining the european economic community ó huiginn says that the subsequent decision to join the european economic community was another important milestone in the development of the economy that was huge we were now part of the eec the regional fund was coming in that was an enormous benefit and then the billions we got from the regional funds and subsequently the cohesion fund ó huiginn acknowledges that anti eu sentiment has risen over the past few years particularly in the wake of the 2010 bailout but ireland has been a huge net beneficiary from brussels since accession in 1973 and that should not be forgotten he says he went to brussels that year as a director of regional policy in the council of ministers in this role o huiginn had responsibility for setting up the original framework of the regional fund i published a report on the extent to which the civil service was centralised in dublin he remembers two thirds of civil servants were centralised in dublin whereas the proportion in other ec countries was 30 40 in the light of this study the council of ministers agreed to loan me back to the government for two months to assist in developing a programme for a more decentralised civil service ó huiginn also demurred at the appointment of professor colin buchanan to advise on regional strategy as he came from the most urbanised state in the ec whereas ireland had the highest rural population i published a study that showed how successful industry was in the county towns and that this should be a focus of development strategy the ida backed that view after a few years in brussels he decided to return to dublin and go back to the civil service he joined the newly minted department for economic planning and development where noel whelan was the secretary general i was there only a few months when charlie haughey abolished it he says at the time this was seen as a power grab by the taoiseach as he set up an economic policy group under his control to replace the department haughey abolished the planning department for the simple reason that you can t have two ministers in parity to each other the minister for finance has no special ability to take down the minister for planning there was a basic conflict of two ministers of equal standing trying to run the economy and that was why partly haughey decided he was acting as a managing director when somebody at the centre has to make the decision and he decided to be that person but that was normal at the time even margaret thatcher set up an economic policy group in order to cut through the red tape and the slowness with which policy development goes through the cabinet system the cabinet system works ok in normal times but not when you want speedy decisions a policy originates in a department and it has to circulate a draft memorandum around the place and it has to deal with copious notes being written and replied to and so on and months pass and eventually a memorandum incorporating everything goes to government and they all have to understand this and so on haughey set up his own economic policy unit in the aftermath of the oil crisis which was standard procedure among oecd countries says ó huiginn because prime ministers all said we have to take charge we ve to run this like a business we can t be waiting for memos to go around breaking the marriage bar perhaps one of ó huiginn s earliest and most significant contributions to public life came when he was the head of an foras forbartha the national physical planning institute between 1964 and 1973 during this period he broke the marriage bar on employing women i recruited a girl who was an expert some qualification she had obtained in london on the protection and preservation of sand dunes very important to us we have so many sand dunes we re an island with sand dunes all over which are very dangerous if they are not treated there are historical records of whole villages being consumed the big threat at the time was the sand dunes in brittas bay and this girl was working on this and laying out a plan for it and so on when she came to me one day and said i m leaving you and i said oh why and she said i m getting married i said congratulations but i said you don t have to leave what do you mean she said i have to after the marriage bar i said no are you prepared to come back as a consultant and then she said yes and i said same terms yes she said i d be delighted and my husband will be even more delighted so she came back i went to the board and we had a mixed board of civil servants and they agreed without any thought that it seemed like the natural thing to do i got a call from the head man in finance and he said pádraig i hear you have re employed a girl who got married and he said you can t do that and i said why not and he says you know the marriage bar and i said i know but we re a private company and i have a mixed board and this girl is invaluable i can t let her go he says you re insisting on it and i said yes i am my board has approved it and he said you ll hear from us within six months finance was in a similar case where a girl went to get married she had come in as an administrative officer and was going to retire upon marriage and they said no you can stay on they ended the marriage bar six months after i broke it it was the end of 1964 economic recovery and the ifsc however the two key events for which ó huiginn will be most remembered are his role in the blueprint for economic recovery written in the mid 1980s and the subsequent development of the international financial services centre when charles haughey formed a minority fianna fáil government in 1987 the country was on the precipice unemployment was running at 18 and debt was at 122 of gnp there had been calls for the international monetary fund to take over the running of the economy haughey was implacably opposed to the idea says o huiginn if we bring these guys in we re gone this is a parliamentary democracy and we have to run the country we re elected to do it he says if these guys come in civil servants are going to run the country ó huiginn had been responsible for coming up with the seminal strategy for development document in 1986 through his chairmanship of the national economic and social council it called for much tighter control of public finances in order to rein in the ballooning levels of debt he says that he told garret fitzgerald the then taoiseach that he should adopt the programme because even fianna fáil will have to support you he said no i m going to set up a committee which included professor walsh from ucd and tom hardiman but i said this is urgent i said how long will it take them to produce this report i said that those people will not agree to produce a report in six months and in the end i think it took them a year and a half i think macsharry points out in his book that the delay was fatal of course garret had the problem of the labour party who wouldn t compromise but the reality of garret fitzgerald is that he was not really interested in the economy his interest was northern ireland the fine gael labour coalition government fell because it could not agree spending cuts fianna fáil formed a minority government in march 1987 with haughey as taoiseach and ray macsharry as the minister for finance they quickly set about the strategy for development which stabilised the public finances in the early 1990s and formed the basis for the celtic tiger ó huiginn says that macsharry was wonderful as minister of finance i can remember he was unyielding in refusing extra expenditure and in cutting expenditure i remember once pleading with him on behalf of some poor devils in sligo which was his own constituency involved in something to do with rivers and i said it wouldn t cost much and he said i m not giving way to anybody not even people in my own constituency knock airport one of his more colourful encounters with haughey was when the taoiseach came back from a weekend away in mayo he said do you know monsignor horan and i said well i know who he is but i don t know him well he said he s the parish priest of knock and he wants to build an international airport in knock what do you think ó huiginn said that it would cost roughly 12m which alternatively would only pay for a few miles of motorway and he said maurice doyle will never agree and ó huiginn told him to ignore doyle in no uncertain terms he told haughey that he was in charge supporting the filmmaking industry support for the creative industries was another high profile haughey era policy as ó huiginn recalls i suggested to mr haughey that we should stimulate filmmaking by giving tax relief on investment in filmmaking the industry now employs 6 000 in filmmaking i also suggested to mr haughey the tax incentive for rental housing which was highly successful employing 10 000 at one stage perhaps ó huiginn s most enduring legacy is the role he played in setting up the ifsc it was originally the brainchild of dermot desmond the founder of ncb stockbrokers who approached haughey about the idea the then taoiseach approached o huiginn about setting up and chairing a meeting with a number of vested interests from the public and private sectors i was given the task by mr haughey of establishing the financial services centre and succeeded in doing so it now employs 30 000 people reflects ó huiginn dermot and i knew each other we played golf and so on so we had a meeting and we called in all the experts both public and private all the banks and so on and they were all at a loss the one question they were all asking except the ida who were very positive was what services are you talking about well i said you re bankers you must know and they said what financial services could we be attracting here haughey heard about the lack of progress at the meeting and summoned desmond and ó huiginnto his office he put ó huiginn in charge of the project with the full authority to make decisions he then went about setting up a committee that would be responsible for selling the concept of the ifsc abroad then the problem was that we were very slow at getting any takers although i remember making a speech in london that said if you want to set up in dublin we d give you a decision in two weeks i think it was six months in luxembourg but we weren t getting the applications the ida and the ifsc the ida were the people to promote it so i said to haughey that the ida are very supportive but they are not into banking the special committee set up to promote the ifsc included tomás f ó cofaigh former governor of the central bank séamus paircéir former chairman of the revenue commissioners kieran mcgowan from the ida and mossie horgan from the department of finance i said if anyone can open the doors of the bank it s ó cofaigh and so we sent them all over the world and ó cofaigh was able to get in to central banks all over the world then they started to flow dresdner came in once you got one bank from a country the other banks followed the ifsc is now host to about 500 of some of the biggest financial institutions in the world it directly employs over 35 000 people and contributes about 2 1bn every year to the exchequer and while the ifsc has played a hugely important role in the development of the economy the domestic banking sector has not fared so well banks were a vital cog in the credit fuelled property bubble of the 2000s which resulted in the collapse of the financial system in 2010 ó huiginn says that the problem with the irish banking system over the past few decades is that it was inefficient the banking system was staffed by people who came in at the bottom of the rung a bit like the civil service they had no real capacity they just learned the business they just knew the money came in and came out he believes that the recruitment process across the irish banking system has to be reviewed he is also very critical of the state guarantee of the banking system introduced on the night of september 29th 2008 the government should have gone to the eu commission and european central bank before introducing the wide ranging guarantee that eventually undermined the sovereignty of the state he says they should have gone to europe the next day and said we have a problem and it s your problem by the time they did go to europe the guarantee was already in place so it was too late govermemnt reform in addition ó huiginn would like to see a major reform to the institutions of government we have 15 government departments in a population of 4 4 million and there are 15 sub ministries and sub departments and i am quite sure this is not necessary i said this to leo varadkar before he became minister i said you could run an empire with 15 government departments and he said the british did it with seven upon retirement he joined the board of esat telecom which was owned by businessman denis o brien ó huiginn says that o brien is one of the most able businessmen the country has produced he also says that charles haughey was a complex person with many different facets to his personality and is well aware of his faults he had that ability to make decisions he was a different politician johnny ronan tried to buy his estate and he said to me it was terrible negotiating with haughey i said to him you forget you re negotiating with three people he was a politician a lawyer and an accountant you rarely meet that jesus he said that s what it was but when i would have one argument haughey would come up with another ó huiginn has worked closely with some of ireland s most influential figures in business and in the civil service and become a figure of immense historical impact in the process

german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it georg schaeffler faced a 1 2 billion tax bill after his company restructured a huge debt julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also

high wealth audit if so we d like to hear about your experiences email or on signal at 718 496 5233 but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider charles rettig commissioner of the internal revenue service said if any group were auditing donald trump it would be the global high wealth team aaron p bernstein getty images that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person former irs commissioner steven miller tried to fix the agency s approach to auditing the ultrawealthy nicholas kamm afp getty images the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception get our top investigations subscribe to the big story newsletter taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes loading the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler and his mother maria elisabeth ran into trouble after their family auto parts company acquired tiremaker continental ag in the middle of the financial crisis julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled in the refinancing the banks and schaeffler had agreed to split the company s debt which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money in short it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction the junior debt was another matter and its provisions would raise the hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know when they d receive it or even if they would ever get anything to the irs these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person the irs efforts to police the superwealthy have been a bust michael brochstein sopa images lightrocket via getty images in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery the schaeffler group s business rebounded despite a recent dip in the car market things have turned out ok for georg schaeffler today forbes estimates his fortune at over 13 billion read more how the irs was gutted an eight year campaign to slash the agency s budget has left it understaffed hamstrung and operating with archaic equipment the result billions less to fund the

the purpose of this article is to assess the macro fiscal flows for february 2019 and determine what effect these flows will have on the stock market and the economy macro fiscal flows impact investment markets with a lagged effect of typically one month a flush of funds now from government spending or credit creation by banks will lead to a boost in investment markets one month later due to the recent partial federal government shutdown the financial figures are late it is now the beginning of april 2019 and the budget figures for the federal government just released are for february 2019 usually the budget data is available within one month and provides tradeable information due to the lagged impact effect to understand the fiscal flows one has to look at the balance of sectoral flows within the us economy using stock flow consistent sectoral flow analysis professor wynne godley first comprehended the strategic importance of the accounting identity which says that measured at current prices the government s budget balance less the current account balance by definition is equal to the private sector balance gdp federal spending non federal spending net exports as a percentage of gdp all three sectors sum to zero and balance each other out a table of recent sectoral balance flows is shown below source fred plus author calculations estimate to be updated when the end of year numbers are known forecast based on existing flow rates and plans a recession has never occurred while the private domestic sector balance is in positive territory and has always occurred when it is in negative territory it is the best kept secret national balance of accounts accounting the chart below shows the newly released government budget data it shows a deficit for february 2019 of 234 billion which in reserve accounting terms means money added vertically into the economy by the currency issuer that now appears on measures of money supply such as m1 m2 and m3 this money has been created at a keystroke as a result of the government paying its bills for goods and services from the private sector and also for benefit payments it is all private sector income the chart below shows credit creation over the same period credit creation was flat in february 2019 and added as good as no additional new credit money into the private sector this is a weak result the following chart shows the current account over a similar period the current account gap in the united states widened to usd 134 4 billion in q4 2018 or 2 4 of gdp this result shows that america swapped us dollars that it can create on a keyboard at the central bank at practically no cost for real foreign goods and services the stronger the dollar the more real foreign goods and services one can have virtually for free this is a sovereign privilege few understand impact on fiscal flows this month the balance of account looks like this for the private domestic sector balance is an accounting identity true by definition inserting the numbers estimate the current account deficit is 134 4 billion for that last quarter and this works out to 44 8 billion per month 189 2 billion net add to this number one can add the impact of credit creation for january 2019 to work out the net change in the money supply and aggregate demand p c net money supply change domestic aggregate demand 189 2 billion 2 81 billion 192 billion net add this is a positive addition to aggregate demand overall and is why the market has rallied through february 2019 and into march macro fiscal flows of this sort have a one month flow on effect on the stock market hopefully the federal government will catch up with its budget release routine so that one can get an idea of the market action in march 2019 based on the flow of funds from february 2019 one clue going forward is the flow of funds from the treasury cash balance shown in the chart below from mr robert p balan and his pam service and in this article what the treasury cash balances show is that we can expect a general fall in the markets due to a net extraction of funds from the economy in april 2019 this coincides with the remittance of tax at tax time the subsequent rise after april is the refund of overpaid tax once newly lodged tax returns have been processed plus normal government spending it is likely that over half a trillion dollars will be extracted from the private sector in a short space of time as the treasury table below from last year shows the stock market normally recovers from this net drain in may and june until then it is likely we will see flat to falling markets and a lot of volatility in the stock market spy dia qqq as households and businesses hold spending back in anticipation of the forthcoming tax payment in april and then remit the payment and have less cash to spend on real goods and services on main street until after april 2019 one might want to sit out the volatility in cash uup or bonds tlt other factors that may add to the april stock market low would be failure of the trump trade discussions with china or at the least only a mediocre outcome and more tariffs for china and our other trading partners the trade talks are dragging on and that is not a good sign a federal government shutdown if the federal debt ceiling is not raised in time most likely the mexico wall funding will be used for not signing off on the debt ceiling and our president will once again be proud to shut down the government until it is this will be more serious than the last partial shutdown as it will be a full shutdown one can see from the treasury statement above that the last partial shutdown had little or no effect on government fiscal flows as compared to the same time the year before after april there will be a stock market dip that can be bought with some confidence given the rebound in government spending and the rising level of world central bank treasury balances which have become de facto fiscal policy skewed in the direction of paper assets such as shares and bonds the market should begin to collapse after the middle of april as that is when the large income tax payments are made as the table below shows source irs video portal home page
on june 30 2016 an auto parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread the internal revenue service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent the reviews resulted in no additional taxes the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiestamericans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled in the refinancing the banks and schaeffler had agreed to split the company s debt which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money in short it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction the junior debt was another matter and its provisions would raise the hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know when they d receive it or even if they would ever get anything to the irs these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery the schaeffler group s business rebounded despite a recent dip in the car market things have turned out ok for georg schaeffler today forbes estimates his fortune at over 13 billion

lynch operator hello and welcome to the greenbrier companies second quarter of fiscal year 2019 earnings conference call following today s presentation we will conduct a question and answer session each analyst should limit themselves to only two questions until that time all lines will be on a listen only mode at the request of the greenbrier companies this conference call is being recorded for instant replay purposes at this time i d like to turn over the conference over to mr justin roberts vice president and treasurer mr roberts you may begin justin roberts thank you angela good morning welcome to our second quarter conference call on today s call i m joined by greenbrier s chairman and ceo bill furman lorie tekorius executive vice president and coo and adrian downes senior vice president and acting cfo they will discuss the results for the quarter and provide an outlook for greenbrier s business in fiscal 2019 following our introductory remarks we will open up the call for questions in addition to the press release issued this morning which includes supplemental data additional financial information and key metrics can be found in a slide presentation posted today on the ir section of our website matters discussed on today s conference call include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 throughout our discussion today we will describe some of the important factors that could cause greenbrier s actual results in 2019 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of greenbrier and with that i ll ask bill to take it away bill furman okay thank you very much justin and good morning everyone highlights of greenbrier s second fiscal quarter included a solid railcar order activity and increased railcar deliveries and revenue generation but our financial performance in the quarter was obviously disappointing our 2019 plan identified our second quarter as the least profitable of the year due to in part to expected manufacturing inefficiencies from production line changeovers and building of a fleet of cars for syndication however we also encountered three distinct headwinds mentioned in our press release that impacted profitability in the quarter specifically challenges in manufacturing at our romanian and gunderson facilities and facility closure costs in railcar repair operations these factors caused second quarter earnings per share to fall short of our goals despite these challenges during the quarter our projected deliveries and revenue for the year remain on target ergo we now estimate fiscal 2019 earnings per share in the range of 3 60 to 3 80 excluding the railcar contract loss accruals and facility closure costs incurred during the quarter adrian will discuss our second quarter financial results and full year financial guidance in more detail while lower than our previous outlook we are confident in greenbrier s ability to perform within this range we have identified the core issues creating the negative financial performance in our romanian facilities in particular and our gunderson operations and our railcar repair network by far the romanian operations were the most significant and we believe we have a new handle a handle on that with new management under the leadership of long time greenbrier officer william glenn who used to run our european operations and has recently rejoined the company we are also making rapid progress in addressing other performance issues that impacted the quarter i ll briefly offer observations on the current conditions we see in the market and impact potential impact to our business recent macroeconomic data indicates the u s economy is still growing at a slightly smaller pace in excess of 2 2 of gdp real growth core inflation remains low at approximately 2 and the u s federal reserve is projecting no interest rate hikes in 2019 and continues to signal cautiously into 2020 overall low inflation and less restrictive monetary policy in the united states and north america should allow for gdp expansion throughout the balance of the year into 2020 and possibly into 2021 throughout march north american rail traffic is down year over year this is in part due to harsh winter weather conditions and declines in some commodity areas although car loadings are down intermodal activity remains fairly constant from 2018 levels and train velocity continues to be negative greenbrier continues to and part of that is due of course to weather and flooding greenbrier continues to closely monitor the rollout of precision scheduled railroading also known as psr at various class one railroads while this is not a new initiative and is not being implemented by all railroads it is a trend that merits attention and we re tracking it closely it has both potential negatives and potential positives to car builders and leasing companies although greenbrier is not presently experiencing any direct impact from psr we will be quick to act on any effects it may produce over time in the railroad equipment and services market one of our defining characteristics is the ability to navigate shifting market dynamics with responsive products and services and to address issues when they arise so we hope to get past this quarter and begin a more normalized performance pattern our strategy of reinforcing the core north american market is succeeding with almost all fiscal 2019 production slots filled and moving into 2020 our integrated team is working to fulfill and fill those in europe customer inquiries remain solid greenbrier astra rail is in active negotiations with several railcar fleet owners for multi year orders there s also been considerable activity in the intermodal sector in europe in part driven by the availability of eu funds designed to take container traffic off the roads to help the continent meet its ambitious carbon reduction goals finally in brazil the economy gained momentum in february after a pause during the presidential transition during fiscal 2019 we ve refocused on strategically reorganizing the size of manufacturing facilities there operated as part of our greenbrier maxion joint venture we believe we re well positioned as gradual economic recovery and the grants of rail concessions takes hold in this year our long term view of the opportunity in brazil remains very positive greenbrier expects a stronger finish to the second half of fiscal 2019 as we have indicated before our strategy is to continue to deliver on the four elements we articulated at the beginning of fiscal 2019 reinforcing our core north american markets executing on our international strategy although we believe that footprint will be stabilized and not be expanding we won t be emphasizing additional growth other than those things that we ve announced robust development number three of the talent pipeline and continuing to grow the business on a larger scale with that i ll turn it back to lorie and justin and adrian lorie tekorius thank you bill good morning everyone i ll briefly provide some more detail on our operating performance before adrian addresses the financial detail we delivered 5 100 railcar units and received orders for approximately 3 800 units valued at nearly 450 million orders in the quarter were for a broad range of car types including covered hoppers automotive carrying railcars and tank cars our diversified backlog as of quarter end totaled 26 000 units with an estimated value of 2 7 billion as bill mentioned and as detailed in our press releases of today and march 22 challenges in romania gunderson and our railcar repair operations negatively impacted results in the quarter by 0 29 per share which includes 0 14 related to loss accruals on certain railcar contracts and facility closure costs with about 95 of 2019 production booked manufacturing execution is critical and we believe we ve identified the right solutions to achieve our updated performance targets in the second half of the year i ll now give a bit more color on those solutions first in europe as bill said effective february 1 william glenn rejoined greenbrier as the ceo of greenbrier astra rail our integrated rail european rail operation with facilities in romania poland and turkey william initially joined greenbrier in 2003 and over 13 years with greenbrier he held several executive positions in both north america and europe william s familiarity with greenbrier its european operations which recently doubled in size and his expertise in operational turnaround will expedite the required changes in europe in his new role william directs all european strategic and commercial activity and he ll work closely with martin graham our executive vice president of manufacturing who adds chief operating officer of greenbrier astra rail to his responsibilities together william and martin have a mandate to improve operating profitability in greenbrier europe second at gunderson we expect operational and financial improvement at gunderson as we restart a railcar production line and eliminate the distraction of production automation activities and hit our stride in marine where in january we received an order from overseas shipholding group osg to construct a second 204 000 barrels oil and chemical atb barge and lastly in repair since we regained direct control of our north american railcar repair shops in september we ve been strategically reviewing the network at unprofitable locations we first focus our efforts on improving the volume and mix of work after this if we determined that a location cannot be profitable we explore the sale to another operator before reaching a final determination to cease operations in the second quarter after ensuring fair treatment was given to our employees we announced plans to conclude operations at two repair locations and although the repair site evaluation continues we re optimistic about the progress we have made in rationalizing our network and intend to achieve significantly improved operating performance by the end of 2019 and beyond the challenges presented in the quarter there were several positives to share leasing revenue was particularly strong resulting from a substantial uptick in syndication activity and to meet syndication demand some of these products were sourced from outside of our own manufacturing operations excluding those products gross margin in leasing services exceeded 51 also in the second quarter greenbrier management services our proprietary rail management provider grew its customer base with seven new customers under contract while securing several multi year renewals from existing customers wheels parts were also positive contributors to greenbrierâ s performance as bill mentioned winter weather slowed railcar loading but it was a tailwind to our wheels business one third of our wheels locations operated on a seven day schedule through the winter months to meet high demand our parts group also delivered a strong quarter led by the production of boxcar doors from our ohio facility and continued demand for end of car cushioning units from our iowa operations moving beyond our north american and european operations brazil remains a challenging environment but the economy is improving and with our joint venture partners amsted rail and iochpe maxion we sized our operations to be poised to respond when rail demand improves greenbrier continues to pursue opportunities to achieve growth at scale we endeavor to do this where scale actuates the other elements of our strategy reinforcing the company s position in core north american markets executing in international railcar markets and growing our talent pipeline for the future although we encountered obstacles in the second quarter everything we face is addressable and solutions are underway to achieve the goals for 2019 and beyond our team is dedicated to meeting our objectives and we continue to be excited about what the future holds for greenbrier adrian i ll turn it over to you to talk about the quarterly financials and our full year guidance adrian downes thank you lorie and good morning everyone quarterly financial information and metrics are available in the press release and supplemental slides on our website given the discussion so far i ll focus on a few additional details in the quarter and then provide additional information on our fiscal year 2019 guidance highlights for the second quarter includes net earnings attributable to greenbrier of 2 8 million or 0 08 per share including 4 7 million net of tax or 0 14 per share of railcar contract loss accruals and manufacturing and closure costs in the repair operations adjusted ebitda of 37 4 million included 7 6 million of an impact from the contract loss accruals and closure costs revenue was 658 7 million up 9 sequentially almost 30 of our 5 100 units delivered were outside the north american market internally produced syndication activity accounted for another 1 200 units delivered in the quarter 10 to 15 of the order activity in the quarter was from international markets orders continue to be broad based across a variety of railcar types and customers aggregate gross margin of 8 2 was below our expectations as a result of the factors already mentioned as we move beyond the production disruptions in the second quarter we expect gross margins to move back into the double digits during the second half of the year we continue to be focused on growing the business and remain optimistic about the opportunities supported by our balance sheet strength and flexibility available liquidity of almost 900 million including over 340 million of cash positions us well to support our strategic objective to grow at scale i m going to spend a few extra minutes discussing the working capital growth that has occurred over the last two quarters much of which is driven by increasing business activity levels inventory balances increased reflecting preparation for substantially higher expected production rates in the second half of fiscal 2019 as well as the outsourcing of lining work on several car types this has increased the length of time to produce cars meaning they are staying in inventory longer than is typical and this will reverse in the fourth quarter as additional internal lining capacity is brought online all else being equal we expect cash balances to exceed 500 million by the end of the year we continue to focus on activities that emphasize cash flow generation and return on capital employed we believe this approach will continue to create long term shareholder value supported by our history of steady dividend increases over the last several years we are confident in our dividend policy and the 0 25 per share quarterly dividend announced today is our 20th consecutive quarterly dividend and represents a yield of over 3 based on current business trends we re updating our fiscal 2019 guidance deliveries to be approximately 24 000 to 26 000 units which includes about 2 000 units from greenbrier maxion in brazil revenue will exceed 3 billion diluted eps of 3 60 to 3 80 excluding the 0 14 per share related to railcar contract loss accruals and closure costs in q2 our updated earnings guidance reflects the impact of q2 as well as somewhat lower earnings expectations for the balance of the year in the affected operations the majority of our prior guidance is unchanged operating cash flow will be positive and given the earnings trajectory will be weighted to the back end of the year g a expense of 205 million to 210 million includes continued support for strategic initiatives including investments in our talent base we will continue to rebalance our lease fleet and expect gains on sale of about 40 million on 120 million of proceeds from those sales similar to 2018 we intend to continue adding to our fleet with expected investments of about 100 million we expect capital expenditures of 105 million in manufacturing and wheels repair and parts combined with our fleet activity our net capital expenditure will be about 75 million depreciation and amortization is expected to be 80 million to 85 million and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates are expected to be breakeven to modestly positive in 2019 we expect 2019 earnings attributable to non controlling interest to be about 40 million and our consolidated tax rate for 2019 is expected to be 25 to 26 our rates will fluctuate due to the geographic mix of earnings and other discrete items operator we ll now open it up for questions operator we ll now open it up for questions question and answer session operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session our first question comes from justin long with stephens your line is open justin long thanks and good morning so i wanted to start with a question on the 7 6 million charge that you called out can you share how much of that was allocated to the wheels parts segment and how much of that was allocated to the manufacturing segment and then just thinking about manufacturing margins is there a way to size up the operational headwind that you saw from europe and gunderson just curious if there s a way to quantify what that was in the quarter adrian downes yes so the closure costs in our repair business was 1 1 million so the other items related to manufacturing are 6 5 million so the bulk of it was in manufacturing lorie tekorius and justin could you repeat the rest of your question sorry i got a little bit lost justin long sure no problem second part was just on the operational headwinds in europe and in gunderson and if there is any way to call out what that impact was as we think about a more normalized margin going forward lorie tekorius right so i would say that we did have headwinds beyond what we talked about on the job loss accruals we had some definite inefficiencies in both europe and at gunderson that are part of the larger number that we called out in the earnings release you ve been through our shops so you know that these things don t necessarily turn on a dime but we didn t wait until the quarter finished to start making adjustments so we have activities underway and we expect modest improvement in the third quarter and even better improvement in the fourth justin long okay and then for my second question i wanted to circle back to a comment that you made bill that you won t be emphasizing growth in some of the international markets beyond what you ve already announced can you just comment on your longer term view of the international businesses i m curious if your opinion on the earnings power or margin potential in those international businesses has changed or is this just simply a case where the processes in europe weren t where they need to be and now you changed management and we should see the issues resolved pretty quickly bill furman okay just simply with regard to international strategy we believe that it will ultimately result in diversity of revenue and earnings by having footprints in different locations however given the nature of the hit in europe and the disappointments there we need to regroup and ensure that we have all of that under control we re also working carefully in brazil the gcc and turkey which is a very small footprint right now we think that it s best to consolidate our activities and have a strong profitable base before we do more to expand but those are the regions that where we are currently operating so i think that answers both aspects of your question adrian downes and justin we did call out 0 29 of performance issues at those units that did include the loss contract accruals as well as the closure costs bill furman yes not at all with units i mentioned but just in europe gunderson facility and then the continuing assimilation of the shop network at within our wheels parts group but it s the repair business the actual wheel parts business as lorie mentioned offset some of that in the repair side justin long okay that s helpful and one just last quick modeling question on incentive comp could you comment on how that assumption has changed versus your prior forecast bill furman our incentive comp goes down if our expectations go down and but lorie can probably give a more precise figure justin or answer to that lorie tekorius i think that s spot on it s yes as our results decline our incentive compensation declines we also the incentive compensation is expensed pro rata consistent with when we have quarters of earnings so we would expect higher if the back half is going to have higher earnings it will have higher expense justin long okay but there s not a dollar amount that you can share that in terms of the change from prior guidance to the guidance you gave today lorie tekorius no not at this time justin long okay fair enough iâ ll leave it at that i appreciate the time bill furman thank you justin operator our next question comes from matt elkott with cowen your line is open matt elkott good morning how are you guys first i have just a maintenance question on the guidance i want to make sure i got this right did you guys say that the net gain on disposition of equipment guidance was unchanged at around 40 million bill furman that s correct adrian downes yes matt elkott okay so the second half should be lower because the first half if you annualize it it would be closer to 52 million bill furman exactly yes the q3 and q4 will be at a lower run rate matt elkott okay that s very helpful my next question is based on your expected deliveries for the second half the 95 that s already in the backlog i think you will be left with just over 11 000 units beyond fiscal 2019 so how much of that or what percentage of that is for fiscal 2020 or beyond and based on the current order activity and the delivery schedules do you think 2020 could be an eps growth year lorie tekorius we always seek to have the next year be an eps growth year regarding where we sit right now on backlog and how our production space is filled into 2020 we re feeling good but we re also in the rail freight business so we never feel really good our guys are working hard every day to fill that space we do have some orders that continue into 2021 i don t think any beyond 2021 maybe just a little bit but i would say the bulk of the backlog that goes from out of 2019 is in 2020 with a little bit going into 2021 and 2022 it s hard for me to think about years that big matt elkott okay and lorie how has the order and inquiry activity been since the end of the quarter bill furman since the end of the quarter we continue to see a lot of visibility in various tank car markets plastics and other derivative products we re also seeing strong demand in some commodity types of gondolas for example a little weaker demand in some car types but in general we think we have very good momentum into 2020 and even some visibility as lorie mentioned into 2021 matt elkott okay so on the tank car front bill you mentioned i guess the tank car outlook continues to be pretty positive or have you seen any recent signs that customers are maybe having second thoughts on pulling the trigger on those orders and also what are the manufacturing lead times for tank cars bill furman the lead times are anywhere from six to 12 months depending on the type we haven t seen a lot of hesitation but i would suggest that we don t want to confuse the mix and think it s all crude by rail there s a broad tank car segment that has a lot of activity going on in it mattelkott okay do you have a sense of how much of the tank car activity is for replacement of older tank cars versus new demand bill furman i think that s a significant factor matt elkott okay all right bill furman but i don t have a statistic to share matt elkott great very helpful thank you very much bill furman thank you matt lorie tekorius thanks matt operator our next question comes from allison poliniak with wells fargo your line is open allison poliniak hi guys good morning lorie i wanted to go back i think you were talking about automation and some of the issues that you had in the quarter can you just give us your high level thoughts is automation just not a process that s going to work and rail car manufacturing is it something that you re reworking to go back any thoughts there lorie tekorius right so allison thank you for that question no we are firmly embracing automation in all of our facilities mexico and in north america manufacturing as well as our aftermarkets business where we can look at ways that we can deploy automation to improve the quality improve efficiencies in our shops and then actually give our employees an opportunity to learn how to work the automation so it s not just a focus on trying to eliminate headcount so if i misspoke during my prepared remarks what i intended to say is that it was a distraction at gunderson it s not that it didn t work or that we re stepping away from it but it just caused management to be a bit distracted with their time bill furman i d just add that we have about 20 people in the team that continues to work on automation and that particular project which was a for key sub assembly on the cars we re replacing chinese content with north american content we were intending to replace that sub assembly at gunderson the supplier we chose and the execution on the job didn t work out to our expectations and we had to regroup but we are going to continue with the gunderson facility particularly to automate as appropriate and it s highly appropriate in that setting allison poliniak perfect that s helpful and then so you touched on psr to some extent i think everybody s very familiar with the negative impact to cars but you did say there are positives could you maybe expand on that a little bit bill furman yes the psr is different things to different railroads different things to different people for some shippers it s a very big negative and i think for the railroad industry in particular if they lose touchwood the shipper community it could cause blowback as matt rose has mentioned at bnsf he s not entirely has not been a great subscriber to psr as it relates to the effect on the customer base of potential regulation that it might bring in the future we all operate through customers and if we can t have if we don t have customers and we concentrate only on internal metrics that particularly are short term it can damage the long term franchise value of the business i think that there s a great debate going on among railroad operating people and ceos we re certainly seeing efficiencies arising at union pacific through psr and other railroads but it s leading some of the shippers looking at other ways to haul their freight and some of those other ways can be through creative programs that can benefit leasing companies and car builders as they aggregate demand in the north american network justin roberts bill if i could add just one other point on to that for companies that are innovative that have strong engineering departments like greenbrier we have a history of introducing new more efficient railcar design and that is attractive to companies that are implementing psr bill furman exactly allison poliniak got it and now you starting to see some of that sort of those inquiries come in at this point justin roberts we ve been working with several of these customers for the last several quarters and i would say the short answer is yes allison poliniak great thanks so much operator our next question comes from bascome majors with susquehanna your line is open bascome majors hey thanks for taking my questions here you talked a little about growing the business acquisitively you re adding some verticals domestically could you talk a little bit about what kinds of business you re not in in north america that you d like to get in or what you could use to supplement the existing portfolio bill furman our management services business has grown from 10 million a year in ebitda to 25 million a year in ebitda over the last several years of the last 10 years that s a significant number we think that that business is a crucial core business and we like that business it s essential to our syndication and leasing and manufacturing strategy so we are internally growing that business we also think that defined core businesses i have those are areas we re concentrating on for growth i m not sure we said that we were well i ll just leave it at that lorie tekorius and i would say i would add on to that right with the technology our management services afford us and we touch over 200 000 of the north 200 000 300 000 bill furman 300 000 yes lorie tekorius cars in the north american fleet so we have access to a lot of information and by using technology to think about things like preventative maintenance ways that we can help to service our customers better is how we think about how we might vertically integrate or integrate across our existing lines of business bascome majors okay yes i apologize i took the comments about not looking to grow the footprint borrowed as a signal that there were some capital deployment opportunities domestically to grow the business acquisitively bill furman well we re not saying that they re we re not denying that we have a very strong balance sheet and if we can employ the capital at a double digit rate of return obviously that would be the best thing for shareholders in addition to dividends we think there are opportunities in the core business to do that all i intended to say is that we want to be sure that our international businesses are in strong footing so we have some work to do in europe for the next couple of quarters to put that ship right on the water before we do the inspection go ahead bascome majors i think it s a good segue to the next question here i mean it sounds like you ve got some challenges at gunderson certainly some challenges in eastern europe but the core mexico manufacturing operation is performing pretty well here and you seem pretty confident in the profit and cash flow outlook for at least the next two or three quarters here looking back you haven t bought your shares since 2016 stock s down almost 50 in the last six months trades are at a pretty significant discount to some of your peers in the place you ve got 100 million buyback plan in place why wouldn t now be the time to act more aggressively on your own stock is that a good place to allocate capital today bill furman our board looks at capital allocation every quarter we on that subject have robust conversations i think as the balance of this fiscal year plays out you ll see us take some definite steps on capital allocation we always are looking at tradeoff between dividends and stock buybacks in terms of returns and total shareholder return but and i wouldn t comment further beyond that but we are very focused on capital allocation and we definitely discuss this at our board meeting every time we have one bascome majors okay fair enough thanks for the time guys bill furman thank you bas lorie tekorius thanks bascome operator our next question comes from steve barger with keybanc capital markets your line is open steve barger hey good morning everybody lorie tekorius good morning steve steve barger you talked about getting cash balance back to 500 million by year end as working capital versus but i m curious if the net impact of the international businesses will be positive or negative free cash flow this year bill furman good question lorie tekorius that is an excellent question i would say bill furman should we talk about hope or should we talk about lorie tekorius actuality bill furman yes actuality lorie tekorius i believe what our forecast currently show is they ll be modestly positive but they won t be the vast majority of what s driving our free cash flow that will be the north american market steve barger and do you feel like you have visibility as you go into next year to see a positive reversal there is that kind of a longer term ramp to seeing those international businesses be free cash flow contributors lorie tekorius well bill regularly tells me i m not allowed to have feelings but yes i believe that we will continue to see as the operations improve we expect to see that flow through to operating cash flow as well bill furman yes just a little color on that the thing that happened in europe was and i bear some responsibility here we relied heavily on european management we do have control with the supervisory board but we made some bad decisions in particular we ve been buffeted by supply problems over there knorr brakes for example in europe has gone through a recent reorganization and management or buy out or a private equity buy out things have really gotten bad there they have virtually a monopoly we re going to seek either regulatory intervention because they ve been very slow to provide not just to us but to other builders and repair facilities the necessary brake systems and they failed in their responsibility in that regard so these issues are being addressed and i think that s the one that lingers but we were accepting orders we tried to put 10 pounds on a five pound bag through the enthusiasm of the local group i think we will have a more disciplined and orderly input of orders there so we will take orders that are profitable and we will also avoid the state owned enterprises that put penalties which cannot even and sometimes be addressed by force majeure so i think we have a much better prospect we exactly understand what happened and we know what to do about it and i feel confident that by the fourth quarter we ll see a huge reversal of headwinds to a tailwind there steve barger got it that s good detail thanks and bill just to clarify your earlier comments on demand levels for railcars have inquiry to order conversion remain steady with what you were seeing last year domestically and internationally bill furman yes steve barger good and justin can you clarify the comment on how new car designs specifically go to benefit psr justin roberts so if you go into a customer call it a class i railroad 10 years ago and you would have said we can take six feet of a railcar and still maintain the cubic capacity you may or may not have had much of an audience if you go into a class i now and say the same thing they re very interested in understanding how they can put more railcars into a train and carry more cubic capacity steve barger got it okay and last one for me and it s probably too early to talk about this but if we do get into an order slow down and deliveries were to decline next year what are the mitigation plans for the manufacturing footprint to minimize decremental margins bill furman two significant ones we are implementing and a test case in brazil rightsizing factories to stabilize the workforce and to improve margins by not going after market share only brazil is a very interesting country where there only two car builders for example we are the have the largest market share but i think we re running we have been running brazil with too many workers for the volume that could be obtained at the current levels when and if in north america we see the next decline and certainly it will be when not if this flexible footprint that we have in mexico where we can size the factories quite quickly needs to be expanded or extended to gunderson it needs to be extended and used actively in europe because you can end up putting the cart before the horse having a facility that s too large and then competing for orders that are not truly profitable because you re simply supporting the workforce i think it s easy for a car builder if you re not paying attention to drift into that and that s a primary thing that we re doing i think the second point just is that half of our facilities or more than half in north america are highly flexible and we can add and deduct employees pretty easily in the united states it s harder because all manufacturers all businesses are coping with a changed demographic in the workforce and i think we have to look at not adding and deducting in the united states but rather a stable workforce base and then just going after the business that will support that base steve barger understood thanks for the time bill furman thank you operator our next question comes from matt brooklier with buckingham research your line is open matt brooklier yes thanks and good morning i know it s a kind of a smaller part of your manufacturing business but can you talk about how much revenue you booked at marine during the fiscal second quarter and maybe a little bit more color on where the backlog currently sits justin roberts so matt this is justin the marine revenue in the quarter was between 10 million to 15 million probably closer to 10 million and we expect it to ramp up to a more sustainable range of around kind of 15 million in the for the next several quarters with the two large barges we received orders for from osg we ve got visibility extending deep into calendar 2020 at this point bill furman yeah the other thing about marine though is it cannot be measured by the size of the revenue it absorbs by its nature of its business it absorbs a great deal of overhead at the facility so the economics of that business combined with railroad railcars there creates a different dynamic so the marine business is a very important part of gunderson we see we have pretty good visibility out into 2021 in that business with two barges we ve got and the other things in the pipeline matt brooklier okay so it sounds like part of the gunderson margin improvement story is partially related to work ramping up on the marine side and getting more of the fixed cost absorption bill furman exactly matt brooklier okay bill furman you got it matt brooklier yeah and then if you ve talked a little bit about it but kind of the cadence of earnings in the second half of this year maybe talk to the expectations for deliveries on what s left if i look at what you ve delivered year to date and use the mid point of your guidance ex brazil right we re talking about 14 300 cars in the past you ve talked about maybe percentages of when we should anticipate kind of the magnitude of deliveries but just a little bit more color on the deliveries i think would be helpful thanks justin roberts we ll see a meaningful step up in q3 and then another meaningful step up in q4 i would say that it s probably a maybe a 20 increase roughly in q3 and then another maybe 10 to 15 increase in q4 part of this is that again as we ve been saying this fiscal year q2 was positioning us to increase our production rates in the back half of the year that is already occurring and we will be stabilizing in q3 with our run rate exiting in q4 matt brooklier okay very helpful thank you lorie tekorius and the other thing that i would the other thing i would add onto that justin is that we had talked about which has been a consumer of cash flow is we do have a number of assets on the balance sheet that we expect to syndicate in the third and fourth quarter so you ll see additional volume there matt brooklier got it okay thank you for the color bill furman thank you operator our next question comes from ken hoexter with bank of america merrill lynch ken hoexter hey bill if i could just revisit your prior answer there the flexibility in the u s on your cost side and europe versus mexico i mean just simply because of unionization it s going to be much more difficult to flex in the in at gunderson in europe versus mexico where is that what you were saying where you have much more flexibility bill furman no it s actually the opposite we re not unionized gunderson and we are unionized in mexico but the union unions the nature of unions in mexico are not exactly like they are in the united states so you can add or deduct workers but what i meant to say if just at simple terms is we re going to try to size the facilities to the market we re going to try to produce to work on a sustained volume that will fit the size of those facilities what we used to do and what railcar builders used to do is if they had a surge of business they d go out and hire a lot of new employees and then if the surge as the surge passed they would layoff workers i don t think anyone in this environment and probably in the foreseeable future looking at demographics of age and work preference will be able to afford to do that or that it s a sustainable model i think instead the focus on a flexible workforce with some contract workers you ll have a core set of highly trained people you will retain and you will put business in different facilities in the more flexible facilities where you can add or deduct labor so i think that i ve seen this all around not just us but other builders too where when you are trying to increase the work force and then decrease it rapidly it creates all kinds of pain and sorrow safety statistics decline safety is one of our most important it is our most important priority and you also have a real impact on quality reliability and it just that things have changed in the workforce we you can t do it the way we used to do so what we re doing is getting a core facility with a core fleet of work and trying to make that work more profitable with higher margins that means that like precision railroading we re going to turn away some customers that have been used to buying very cheaply relative to other car types or other customers ken hoexter that s great great clarification thanks for that then let me keep on the cost side just for one more on sg a you had a big up quarter last quarter down slightly year over year this quarter maybe i don t know lorie if you have any thoughts on spending is that a lever based on kind of market demand then as you flow or maybe just kind of thoughts on the sg a side lorie tekorius sure ken i think we touched a little bit on the fact that we would expect sg a to step up a bit in the second half of the year just from an incentive compensation perspective so because we record those expenses as we generate the earnings now if we can t do everything that we ve been trying to explain to you guys that we plan to do in the second half that will occur we don t have any other that jumps to mind significant movements in what will be driving sg a to be materially different from kind of taking let s say an average of the first half of 2019 ken hoexter okay and then lastly for me just to follow up on allison s question bill you mentioned the kind of positives on psr can you talk about the other side have you had any orders that got eliminated i mean you ve now got more than half the group that s jumped on in the past call it six months with up now talking in case has there been a change of order process through that that three year discussions bill furman i think justin more or less nailed it specifically on the design service design aspect of a freight car we and at least one other builder have really advanced the art there and it s not and it s probably not rocket science but that s been a big plus and on the negative side it hasn t affected us yet we have we are closely watching velocity there s a of course an issue with velocity right now because of the floods as soon as we have more normalized weather i think we ll be able to have a better understanding probably by the next quarter but we haven t really seen our order book or order throughput affected adversely you have to keep in mind further that shippers are a large part of the customer base besides just railroads railroads are they own fewer cars than shippers and leasing companies combined and if you count tgx as a leasing operation biggest in north america and in the world it that s where the action is so it affects shippers adversely psr does in some cases and positively in other cases so it is a little bit of a complex thing and it varies by railroad railroad by railroad and how it s getting implemented some are doing it very well some of them are basically just cutting costs and cutting service and that doesn t set well with a lot of shippers so those shippers may either go to ot 5s that s rivers allow them and run their own cars which creates demand or they might go to trucks or they might go to the stb and complain which we believe they will do depending on how harsh this environments gets ken hoexter and just i guess on that the crude order from alberta did that all stay in canada or did some of that come to the manufacturing market in the u s bill furman i think that some was in canada and some was in the were to awarded to u s car builders ken hoexter okay all right thanks for the time and thoughts appreciate it bill furman thank you bill furman thank you very much everyone for your attention today for those still in the queue we can we will follow up later today and set up explicit one to one calls otherwise thank you very much and have a great day operator thank you for your participation in today s conference please disconnect at this time

the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider charles rettig commissioner of the internal revenue service said if any group were auditing donald trump it would be the global high wealth team aaron p bernstein getty images that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person former irs commissioner steven miller tried to fix the agency s approach to auditing the ultrawealthy nicholas kamm afp getty images the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception get our top investigations subscribe to the big story newsletter taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes loading the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler and his mother maria elisabeth ran into trouble after their family auto parts company acquired tiremaker continental ag in the middle of the financial crisis julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled in the refinancing the banks and schaeffler had agreed to split the company s debt which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money in short it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction the junior debt was another matter and its provisions would raise the hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know when they d receive it or even if they would ever get anything to the irs these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person the irs efforts to police the superwealthy have been a bust michael brochstein sopa images lightrocket via getty images in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery the schaeffler group s business rebounded despite a recent dip in the car market things have turned out ok for georg schaeffler today forbes estimates his fortune at over 13 billion

it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled in the refinancing the banks and schaeffler had agreed to split the company s debt which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money in short it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction the junior debt was another matter and its provisions would raise the hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know when they d receive it or even if they would ever get anything to the irs these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery the schaeffler group s business rebounded despite

maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it georg schaeffler faced a 1 2 billion tax bill after his company restructured a huge debt julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court have you been involved in a global high wealth audit if so we d like to hear about your experiences email or on signal at 718 496 5233 but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact

almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled in the refinancing the banks and schaeffler had agreed to split the company s debt which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money in short it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction the junior debt was another matter and its provisions would raise the hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know when they d receive it or even if they would ever get anything to the irs these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person the irs efforts to police the superwealthy have been a bust michael brochstein sopa images lightrocket via getty images in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery the schaeffler group s business rebounded despite a recent dip in the car market things have turned out ok for georg schaeffler today forbes estimates his fortune at over 13 billion read more how the irs was gutted an eight year campaign to slash the agency s budget has left it understaffed hamstrung and operating with archaic equipment the result billions less to fund the

series gutting the irs who wins when a crucial agency is defunded propublica is a nonprofit newsroom based in new york sign up for propublica s big story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published on june 30 2016 an auto parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread the internal revenue service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it georg schaeffler faced a 1 2 billion tax bill after his company restructured a huge debt julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court have you been involved in a global high wealth audit if so we d like to hear about your experiences email or on signal at 718 496 5233 but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider charles rettig commissioner of the internal revenue service said if any group were auditing donald trump it would be the global high wealth team aaron p bernstein getty images that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person former irs commissioner steven miller tried to fix the agency s approach to auditing the ultrawealthy nicholas kamm afp getty images the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception get our top investigations subscribe to the big story newsletter taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes loading the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler and his mother maria elisabeth ran into trouble after their family auto parts company acquired tiremaker continental ag in the middle of the financial crisis julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled in the refinancing the banks and schaeffler had agreed to split the company s debt which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money in short it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction the junior debt was another matter and its provisions would raise the hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know when they d receive it or even if they would ever get anything to the irs these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person the irs efforts to police the superwealthy have been a bust michael brochstein sopa images lightrocket via getty images in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery the schaeffler group s business rebounded despite a recent dip in the car market things have turned out ok for georg schaeffler today forbes estimates his fortune at over 13 billion read more how the irs was gutted an eight year campaign to slash the agency s budget has left it understaffed hamstrung and operating with archaic equipment the result billions less to fund the

whatever one thinks of donald trump s proposal to build a beautiful wall it is unlikely to resolve the crisis sending ever more people largely from central america to america s borders the problems that drive large numbers to leave their homes and trust their families to criminal gangs will not be solved by bigger fences but better thinking fundamentally the united states should regard mexico and central america not as adversaries but as economic partners in a world increasingly defined by competition between the u s and an ever more aggressive china determined to establish global hegemony even in our hemisphere in this context a strong policy of investment and aid to our southern neighbors makes both economic and political sense the american relationship with mexico and central america is implicitly complementary the u s and mexico not only exchange products and services they also produce them jointly american manufacturing or value added inputs represent 40 percent of every dollar mexico exports to the united states chinese exports to the u s represent only one tenth as much mexico complements the u s in ways that promote regional competitiveness capital abundance and high skilled labor in the u s are complemented by low skilled labor abundance and capital scarcity in mexico factors that are if anything even more evident in central america the region s weak human capital accumulation has hobbled its integration with advanced trading partners like the united states in central america more than half of youths between 15 and 24 are out of the educational system and most work at poorly paid jobs only 38 percent of central american youths aged 27 to 29 hold a high school degree compared with 61 percent in the rest of latin america the 1994 passage of nafta led to a period of unprecedented growth and optimism mexico enjoyed macroeconomic stability during which inflation exchange rate volatility and short term interest rates converged with those of the u s economic cycles in industrial production also converged in both countries this emergence was derailed first by china s 2001 entry into the world trade organization and then by the great recession the recession is now a bad memory but china s influence has only grown by 2003 china had surpassed mexico as the second leading importer to the united states behind canada by granting wto membership and most favored nation status to china the u s opened the door for an expansion of chinese manufactured exports to the detriment of traditional sources such as mexico which lost around 650 000 manufacturing jobs from 1995 to 2016 a big overlap exists in the kinds of products clothing automotive and consumer electronics in which both mexico and china excelled the two countries export mixes to the u s became similar just when china increased its manufacturing export capacity mexico specialized in industries and activities in which in some cases china would eventually develop a comparative advantage in 2006 mexico s maquiladoras mostly lower tech factories requiring semi skilled labor to do assembly and finishing work generated more than 25 billion in foreign exchange and accounted for 44 percent of total mexican manufacturing exports 94 percent of maquiladora exports went to the u s as china s access to u s markets grew the maquiladora industry lost jobs largely to china s benefit the increase in chinese exports to the u s hurt mexican labor markets which faced a negative demand shock after 2001 these shocks may have been disproportionately large in the case of manufacturing establishments that use unskilled labor especially for maquiladoras in the border region these factories production structures resembled those of chinese firms and they were thus more vulnerable to china s enhanced presence in the u s import market the displacement of mexican manufacturing products in the u s market led to a decrease in mexican wages and the negative effects spilled over to wages paid in nonmanufacturing industries the decline of manufacturing in mexico has had a devastating impact on the country as china s dominance as a u s trading partner has grown mexico has seen a rapid rise of crime and corruption the once bright hope seen for the country largely as a result of close cooperation with the united states has faded and led most recently to the election of its most aggressively left wing president in 50 years andrés manuel lópez obrador the results south of mexico were even worse in the pre china era mexican manufacturers would move some their more labor intensive operations to central america where costs were lower but as the mexican economy has failed to expand such movement has decreased instead of new production many of these countries simply import manufactured goods from china rather than building industries for liftoff while they export commodities to beijing chinese merchandise imports by central american countries costa rica dominican republic el salvador guatemala and honduras rose from 4 7 billion in 2011 to 8 5 billion in 2017 according to united nations statistics what we now see at the border the desperate movement of families reflects this sad reality as in mexico the nations of central america are afflicted by high unemployment slowing growth and rising criminality if prosperity never fully arrived in mexico it was only scarcely glimpsed farther south this situation and mass migration can be addressed only through a strategic repositioning by the region s dominant economic power this would include more incentives for american businesses that have already decided to move operations out of the country and shift them to mexico where they would at least benefit both countries instead of to china for president trump whose comments about latin america are often both ill conceived and poorly received this initiative would deprive china of markets and allow our closest neighbors to share in a new north american prosperity it s an idea that has gained some support within the administration and from both republicans such as marco rubio and democrats like prospective presidential candidates julian castro and joe biden a bold program that steers american investment and that of allies to mexico and central america could be critical to bolstering our trade position and creating newly receptive customers and it could reshape the immigration debate by slowing migration a win both for america and those countries desperately in need of creating opportunity for their citizens it also would serve to address the historic gap between our neighbors and ourselves there s an old saying in mexico ascribed to the nineteenth century dictator porfirio díaz pobre me xico tan lejos de dios y

your inbox as soon as they are published on june 30 2016 an auto parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread the internal revenue service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it georg schaeffler faced a 1 2 billion tax bill after his company restructured a huge debt julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court have you been involved in a global high wealth audit if so we d like to hear about your experiences email or on signal at 718 496 5233 but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider charles rettig commissioner of the internal revenue service said if any group were auditing donald trump it would be the global high wealth team aaron p bernstein getty images that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person former irs commissioner steven miller tried to fix the agency s approach to auditing the ultrawealthy nicholas kamm afp getty images the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception get our top investigations subscribe to the big story newsletter taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes loading the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler and his mother maria elisabeth ran into trouble after their family auto parts company acquired tiremaker continental ag in the middle of the financial crisis julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled in the refinancing the banks and schaeffler had agreed to split the company s debt which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money in short it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction the junior debt was another matter and its provisions would raise the hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know when they d receive it or even if they would ever get anything to the irs these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person the irs efforts to police the superwealthy have been a bust michael brochstein sopa images lightrocket via getty images in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery the schaeffler group s business rebounded despite a recent dip in the car market things have turned out ok for georg schaeffler today forbes estimates his fortune at over 13 billion

given the idiosyncratic financial risks and weaknesses of the post 2008 era the question arises as to what extent developing countries are equipped to deal with the many hazards in their paths in this context six emerging countries have recently come under the spotlight argentina brazil india indonesia south africa and turkey their domestic economies which together account for 15 6 per cent of world gdp based on purchasing power parity have been critically affected by imbalances and instabilities in the international financial realm that became particularly problematic as soon as monetary conditions in the usa were expected to tighten sparking several episodes of drastic capital outflows alongside severe currency depreciations this makes fears of contagion and concerns of whether any one of these economies could turn out to be patient zero of a new global economic crisis all the more pertinent anxiety over these emerging economies is further heightened by the fact that they were thought to be adequately shielded against exogenous financial shocks since the end of the 1990s and following almost 20 years of intermittent financial crises they have been urged to embrace floating exchange rates and improve their balance sheets mostly through strenuous efforts to build up foreign exchange reserves while these measures have strengthened their resilience to external shocks they obviously fail to deliver on the promise of financial stability especially in the current era of hyperglobalization the growing difficulties faced by this group of upper middle income developing countries may also turn out to be a case study for lower income countries which does not bode well for the continuation of their financial integration the objective of this paper is to measure and track financial stress in these six fragile emerging economies in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008 using unctad financial conditions indicators the paper argues that there is a need for better tools to measure financial stress in the context of growing instabilities and complexities in international and domestic financial markets it then briefly presents the indicators and compares these with relevant existing indices of financial instability unctad financial conditions indicators have performed well in signalling and capturing the effects of external shocks over and above the latest shock arising from appreciations of the dollar and global trade tensions the indicators picked up the fed taper tantrum 2013 commodity price shocks 2014 the renminbi shock 2015 and volatility relating to political uncertainty in the united states and the united kingdom in 2016 with considerable precision given substantial data limitations the publication proceeds with an overview of the occurrence of financial stress episodes in the six selected economies since the onset of the global financial crisis it then further discusses the likelihood of a synchronization of such stress episodes across countries the role played by external drivers of financial instability and countries capacity for resilience to exogenous shocks

economic policy experts rolled their eyes at president trump s last reported nominee for the federal reserve board stephen moore a right wing ideologue with an almost unblemished record of getting his facts and economics wrong but news of trump s choice for a second vacancy on the seven member board has them distinctly nervous it s herman cain a former pizza chain executive best known for staging a clownish campaign for the 2012 republican nomination for president he dropped out after accusations of sexual harassment surfaced what makes economists so wary about cain is his advocacy of one of the dumbest ideas on the monetary landscape a return to the gold standard cain spoke up for the gold standard in a notorious may 2012 op ed in the wall street journal and in a book published around the same time more on this in a moment advertisement on the surface cain s qualifications to serve on the fed board aren t all that unorthodox he was a business leader after all and his supporters note that he served on the board of the federal reserve bank of kansas city where he was deputy chairman from 1992 through 1994 and then chairman until august 1996 the gold standard itself was the principal threat to financial stability and economic prosperity between the wars barry eichengreen uc berkeley that sounds fancy but economist justin wolfers of the university of michigan has put paid to the notion that it was even remotely meaningful the boards of the regional banks have almost no authority and no role in setting economic policy they re essentially sops to local business types and largely ceremonial the regional fed boards really are just there to provide the veneer of democratic legitimacy to an institution that s not really that democratic wolfers tweeted thursday after cain s name surfaced the board enjoy a free briefing from the regional bank staff and the staff pretend to listen to the local bigwigs about the economy the one concrete job entrusted to these boards is the appointment of the regional bank s president who actually does set policy but that s subject to the approval of the federal reserve board in washington in any event the appointment didn t come up during cain s service on the kansas city board so he didn t even do that but now let s examine cain s advocacy of a return to the gold standard this idea periodically percolates to the surface of republican politics especially in presidential election years in the early phase of the 2016 election cycle it was talked up by ted cruz rand paul ben carson mike huckabee and chris christie advertisement their underlying goal was to rein in the federal reserve by depriving it of any freedom in monetary policy the central bank would be unable to pump money into the economy during downturns or tighten the spigots to moderate booms that role would be ceded to the magic of the international gold market economists from one end of the economic spectrum to the other are virtually unanimous in thinking this a flawed idea for example here s milton friedman the closest thing to a deity in conservative economic policymaking in his 1962 book capitalism and freedom he wrote that an automatic commodity standard such as the gold standard was not feasible because the mythology and beliefs required to make it effective do not exist conservative economic commentator james pethokoukis cited friedman s warning in 2015 writing of the gop candidates dalliance with the idea i sure hope they re not serious and this is just campaign season silliness the regional fed boards really are just there to provide the veneer of democratic legitimacy to an institution that s not really that democratic the board enjoy a free briefing from the regional bank staff and the staff pretend to listen to the local bigwigs about the economy pic twitter com heff7vsiwl justin wolfers justinwolfers april 4 2019 when the university of chicago asked a panel of 39 expert economists in 2015 whether a gold standard would be better for the average american they were unanimous no love of the implies macroeconomic illiteracy chicago economist anil kashyap added in a side comment cain s devotion to the gold standard derives from a sheaf of misconceptions about both economic history and its applicability to the modern world under the gold standard he wrote in his op ed economic growth was stronger unemployment rates lower the price level more stable and recessions less frequent and less severe than under the present system tell that to americans in 1929 during the gold standard era and keep in mind that one key to the recovery in the 1930s was franklin roosevelt s decision to take america off the gold standard so it could manage its own economic policy advertisement cain added gold is kryptonite to big spending politicians it is to the moochers and looters in government what sunlight and garlic are to vampires that should give you a clue about what s really at work here it s the old story of running an economy strictly for the benefit of the wealthy who don t have to suffer from the waves of unemployment that were imposed on the working class in order to keep the macroeconomic world of the gold standard humming along the most complete demolition of gold standard mythology comes from barry eichengreen of uc berkeley whose 1996 book golden fetters is the bible of the field eichengreen observes that the gold standard proved utterly unable to manage international monetary crises in the aftermath of world war i and the onset of the depression before then economic policy makers thought of the gold standard as a pillar of stability because they were paying attention only to the welfare of one economic class creditors who desired the returns on their assets to be protected from inflation and to take primacy over the interests of every other group if the economy of one country ebbed relative to another preserving the gold standard meant that something else would have to give laborers thrown out of work or wages brought down if one sector lagged another say falling crop prices endowed city dwellers with cheap food but failed to produce enough income to keep farmers solvent there was no mechanism to bring farm prices into parity with industrial returns via inflation this was accepted because economic policy makers failed to understand unemployment as a reflection of the entire economy in the united states eichengreen writes the unemployed were referred to as out of work idle or loafing but rarely as unemployed in other words there was a tendency to ascribe unemployment to individual failings that viewpoint has reappeared in recent years especially in such republican policies as cuts to social security or medicare benefits or the imposition of work requirements on recipients of food stamps or medicaid the notion of the undeserving poor morally suspect individuals who need to be goaded to get off their lazy butts is common in right wing circles advertisement once the notion took root that workers as well as plutocrats were part of the macroeconomy it became clear eichengreen writes that the gold standard itself was the principal threat to financial stability and economic prosperity between the wars the constraints the gold standard placed on economic planners was recognized with the advent of the new deal upholding the standard in the teeth of the depression observed fdr s treasury secretary henry morgenthau would have meant a ruinous deflation of our prices trade and economic activity the hoover administration he said pointedly had stuck to the gold standard even after it was abandoned by britain and france evidently under the impression that that was a proud achievement when it was obviously economic suicide even if one could make the case for the gold standard in principle it s clear from eichengreen s analysis that now would be the worst time to implement it that s because its success is dependent on credibility and cooperation the first he defines as the confidence invested by the public in the government s commitment to a policy the second is the commitment of all states to take whatever steps are necessary to maintain the international regime how would that work in the era of trump no one can have confidence in his commitment to policy because he has no discernible policy except blowing up some of the oldest and most effective arrangements for international cooperation reached in the postwar years trump s nomination of herman cain if it happens would amount to its own contradiction in terms keep up to date with michael hiltzik follow hiltzikm on twitter see his facebook page or email michael hiltzik latimes com return to michael hiltzik s blog

emphasis on securities issued by master limited partnerships mlps which may increase price fluctuation the value of commodity linked investments such as the mlps and energy infrastructure companies including midstream mlps and energy infrastructure companies in which the fund invests are subject to risks specific to the industry they serve such as fluctuations in commodity prices reduced volumes of available natural gas or other energy commodities slowdowns in new construction and acquisitions a sustained reduced demand for crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products depletion of the natural gas reserves or other commodities changes in the macroeconomic or regulatory environment environmental hazards rising interest rates and threats of attack by terrorists on energy assets each of which could affect the fund s profitability mlps are subject to significant regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment including the risk that an mlp could lose its tax status as a partnership if an mlp was obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at the corporate tax rate the amount of cash available for distribution would be reduced and such distributions received by the fund would be taxed under federal income tax laws applicable to corporate dividends received as dividend income return of capital or capital gain in addition investing in mlps involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock including risks related to cash flow dilution and voting rights such companies may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling the fund is a non diversified closed end management investment

trade at a discount to their net asset value which may increase investors risk of loss the fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the fund because of the fund s concentration in mlp investments the fund is not eligible to be treated as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended instead the fund will be treated as a regular corporation or c corporation for u s federal income tax purposes and as a result unlike most investment companies will be subject to corporate income tax to the extent the fund recognizes taxable income an investment in mlp units involves risks that differ from a similar investment in equity securities such as common stock of a corporation holders of mlp units have the rights typically afforded to limited partners in a limited partnership as compared to common shareholders of a corporation holders of mlp units have more limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting the partnership there are certain tax risks associated with an investment in mlp units additionally conflicts of interest may exist between common unit holders subordinated unit holders and the general partner of an mlp the fund currently seeks to enhance the level of its current distributions by utilizing financial leverage through borrowing including loans from financial institutions or the issuance of commercial paper or other forms of debt through the issuance of senior securities such as preferred shares through reverse repurchase agreements dollar rolls or similar transactions or through a combination of the foregoing financial leverage is a speculative technique and investors should note that there are special risks and costs associated with financial leverage past

hurricane michael devastated timber in florida s panhandle in october 2018 more than 2 8 million acres of florida timberland were believed to be damaged with the timber value damage estimated at 1 3 billion the report states that it is logical to assume the storm damage will cause timberland investors to reevaluate how they account for hurricane risks before investing anywhere in florida interest in florida timberland is not expected to be impacted in the long term and timberland values should remain relatively strong four timberland sales of more than 1 000 acres were verified in 2018 the sales ranged in size from 1 045 acres to 13 220 acres gross sales prices ranged from 1 000 to 2 259 per acre with an average sales price of 1 673 per acre that is significantly higher than the 2017 average of 1 298 per acre we do not believe this is indicative of a jump in timberland prices year over year the report states rather it is believed to be more reflective of the limited number of sales from which to draw data overall we believe florida timberland prices to have been relatively stable through 2018 a real estate investment trust was the buyer of the two largest timberland tracts sold in 2018 those sales were of 13 220 acres in flagler and st johns counties and 6 680 acres in columbia county at the smaller end of the timberland size spectrum 500 to 1 000 acres we have observed
