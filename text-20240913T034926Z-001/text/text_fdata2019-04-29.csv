modern monetary theory and 2x leveraged mreit based etns modern monetary theory is a topic currently being bandied about by some at both ends of the political spectrum stephanie kelton who advised bernie sanders 2016 presidential campaign and was chief economist for the democrats on the u s senate budget committee is a prominent proponent of modern monetary theory her most well known quote is federal deficits are private sector surpluses celebrity member of congress alexandria ocasio cortez d ny and others advocating vast increases in federal government spending in health and education make favorable mention of modern monetary theory ocasio cortez has said that modern monetary theory absolutely needed to be a larger part of our conversation after president trump asserted that he could renegotiate down the treasury debt owned by foreigners his aides informed him that the united states effectively can print its own money trump seemed pleasantly surprised by that fact and since then he has apparently abandoned his campaign promises about balancing the budget and eliminating the national debt during his first term the modern monetary theory version of the fact that sovereign governments can print their own money is that the national government is the monopoly supplier of currency the implications of any sort of adoption by policymakers of modern monetary theory for 2x leveraged high yield etns and especially for those based on an index of mreits could be enormous interest rates are the key determinant of both the dividends paid and the share prices of mreits for credit suisse x links monthly pay 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn reml ubs etracs monthly pay 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn morl and a twin which is essentially identical in all economic respects the ubs etracs monthly pay 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn series b mrrl interest rates are even more important because of the 2x leverage the spread between the longer term interest rates paid by the mortgage backed securities held by the mreits and the shorter term rates they pay on the borrowing they do to finance their mortgage backed securities generates the income that s used to pay their dividends morl mrrl and reml add another level of leverage and effectively borrow at an interest rate based on three month libor in order to increase their monthly distributions most significant for the financial markets modern monetary theory implies that risk free interest rates would be zero possibly even long term government bond rates twelve years ago most market participants would have scoffed at the possibility that interest rates could be zero for any extended period of time they considered the possibility of years of negative interest rates persisting for years as absurd many of those who now scoff at modern monetary theory would not have believed that many developed countries would have negative interest rates for any extended period of time before it actually happened japan and many european countries still have negative or close to zero interest rates this alone gives some support to modern monetary theory in the usa after 2009 as unemployment declined while budget deficits remained large and grew many demanded that the federal reserve raise interest rates some forecast dire outlooks for both inflation and long term interest rates as they perceived the federal reserve as being behind the curve by not raising rates fast enough those critics of the federal reserve whose interest rate forecasts now seem to have been wrong mostly were relying on conventional economics in terms of what were likely to be the impacts of the monetary and fiscal policies that were and are still in effect that leads to the question of why the dire inflation and bond market consequences did not occur keynesian analysis monetarism and the phillips curve would suggest that the large deficits increases in the money supply aggregates and declines in unemployment would have resulted in higher inflation and consequently higher long term bond rates in each case we can identify possible changes in circumstances and or technology that may have prevented these from working furthermore these changes in circumstances and or technology might give some support to modern monetary theory the relative reductions in taxes on the rich may have created a situation where modern monetary theory or at least aspects of modern monetary theory are applicable to the current situation the enormous shift in tax policy favoring the rich has been a worldwide phenomenon going on for many years during the period that the socialist party candidate franã ois hollande was president from 2012 2017 france enacted tax laws that gave france the most progressive tax system among the 20 largest industrial nations however the world wide the tax systems have become so much less progressive in the past decades that if the tax code that france has today were applied to france in 1969 france would have had the most regressive tax system among the 20 countries in 1969 in a world awash in savings and loanable funds some of the aspects of modern monetary theory might have merit modern monetary theory asserts that government debt is money conventional economics agrees that when central banks monetize the government debt money is in a way created in free market capitalism capital generates income for the owners of the capital which in turn is used to create additional capital this is very good sometimes it can be actually too good as capital continues to accumulate its owners find it more and more difficult to deploy it efficiently the business sector generally must interact with the household sector by selling goods and services or lending to them when capital accumulates too rapidly the productive capacity of the business sector can outpace the ability of the household sector to absorb the increasing production a premise of modern monetary theory is that unemployment is evidence that government as monopoly supplier of the currency is not supplying a sufficient amount of money to the economy modern monetary theory describes money as the difference between the amount supplied to the economy through government spending minus the amount taken back by the government via taxation and fines that could also be called the budget deficit that governments should run deficits to reduce unemployment is not an original idea in 1936 keynes refuted the tenet of classical economics which said that market mechanisms would always restore depressed economies to levels where the supply and demand for labor was in equilibrium in that anyone who was willing to work at the prevailing wage rate could find employment keynes demonstrated that the economy could stay in a new equilibrium where the diminished desired investment equaled the diminished desired savings and unemployment remained high indefinitely keynes argued that economic activity could remain in a depressed equilibrium level and called for government deficit spending to replace and compensate for the reduced autonomous private sector investment there has always been push back against the use of deficit spending advocated by keynes when keynes was asked whether government debt would eventually be harmful in the long run his famous response was in the long run we are all dead in the 1970s when deficits and inflation became major issues critics of keynes said that it is now the long run keynes is dead but we have stagflation which was inflation and relatively high unemployment simultaneously keynes introduced macroeconomic aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves these curves represent relationships between price levels and the quantities of real gdp where the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves intersect is the equilibrium level of prices and real output once in equilibrium the economy tends to stay in equilibrium if not at the equilibrium point it tends to move toward equilibrium when the equilibrium point is at a level of low real output and thus high unemployment output can be stimulated by government policies that shift the aggregate demand curve to the right thus increasing government spending and or reducing taxes have been used as policy tools to move the economy from an equilibrium that is at an undesired level of output and unemployment to an equilibrium with higher output by shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right since unemployment and real gdp are negatively related the relationship shown in the upward sloping aggregate supply curve can be represented by a downward sloping curve where unemployment replaces real gdp on the horizontal axis this is the phillips curve that relates price levels to unemployment for the phillips curve to work changes in unemployment and price levels have to be the result of shifts in aggregate demand while the aggregate supply curve remains relatively stable as was the case in the 1960s when the demand curve is relatively stable but the aggregate supply curve shifts the phillips curve does not work the events such as the failure of the anchovy harvest attributed to el nino weather conditions and spikes in oil prices in the 1970s and after due to events in the middle east and iran caused the aggregate supply curve to shift to the left this caused the phillips curve relationship between unemployment to break down this was called stagflation as the levels of inflation that the phillips curve normally indicated to accompany low unemployment were present while there was relatively high unemployment milton freidman said that the supply of money was the major determinant of economic activity and inflation during the period of very high inflation in the beginning of the 1980s friedman advocated laws that would require the federal reserve to keep the money supply growing at exactly 3 or even replacing the federal reserve with a computer that could keep the money supply growing at exactly 3 during the period covered by the book a monetary history of the united states by milton friedman and anna j schwartz published in 1963 monetarism was more relevant than it is now friedman posited that velocity was relatively stable and thus the equation of exchange tied economic activity to the money supply prior to 1960 that was much more the case than today as i said in federal reserve actually propping up interest rates what this means for mreits money is what can be used to buy things historically money has first been specie gold and silver coins then fiat money which is paper currency and checking accounts m1 and more recently credit money the credit money supply is what in aggregate can be bought on credit two hundred years ago your ability to take your friends out to dinner depended on whether or not you had enough coins specie in your pocket one hundred years ago it depended on the quantity of coins or currency in your pocket and possibly the balance in your checking account if the restaurant would take checks today it is mostly your credit card that allows you to spend you could have nothing in your checking account and no cash in your wallet but that would not stop you from buying things with your credit card we no longer have a fiat money system today we have a credit money system just because there is still some fiat money does not negate the fact that we are on a credit money system when we were on a basically fiat money system there was still a small amount of specie in circulation even today a five cent piece contains about 5 cents worth of metal but no one would claim we are still on a specie money system fiat money is easy to measure m1 was 1 376 trillion in 2007 and is above 3 trillion now nominal gdp has not moved in line with m1 as velocity simply adjusted credit cards and recently other payment mechanisms that do not necessarily require m1 type balances greatly diminished the usefulness of monetarism as promoted by friedman the effective money supply is the sum of fiat money and credit money credit money cannot be precisely measured however when the person in hollister california whose occupation was strawberry picker and who had made 14 000 in his best year was able to get a mortgage of 740 000 with no money down and private equity could buy a company like clear channel in a 20 billion leveraged buyout also with essentially no money down the credit money supply was clearly much higher than today it is fair to say that modern monetary theory has come under more disparagement than the macroeconomics of keynes the monetarism of friedman and the trade offs between unemployment and inflation described by phillips ever has federal reserve chair jerome powell said that modern monetary theory is just wrong larry summers and paul krugman also disparaged modern monetary theory anyone who still could still be remotely characterized as a deficit hawk considers the aspect of modern monetary theory which asserts deficits are not a problem anytime you are not at full employment considers modern monetary theory as heresy obviously there are plenty of places and times where modern monetary theory is or was clearly wrong venezuela today is an example however for the developed capitalist democracies that comprise most of the oecd it is not so obvious that modern monetary theory is without merit at all times many of those who now scoff at modern monetary theory would not have believed that many developed countries would have negative interest rates for any extended period of time before it occurred keynes based his multiplier model that said an increase in deficit spending or a reduction in taxes would induce a greater increase in what we now call gdp on the marginal propensity to consume concept that is that an increase in government spending or a reduction in taxes of 100 would cause consumer spending to initially increase by an amount based on what consumers do with the extra 100 if consumers were to spend 90 of the additional income and save 10 of the extra 100 their marginal propensity to consume would be 0 9 thus the initial extra 100 would induce an extra 90 in consumer spending that 90 provides income to others who in turn spend an extra 81 assuming their marginal propensity to consume is also 0 9 and so on the simple keynesian model assumes a single marginal propensity to consume however that is not the case relevant to the last few decades an increase in the federal deficit that provides tax cuts for the wealthy who have relatively low marginal propensities to consume has a different impact than deficits that result from spending or tax cuts for the non rich the lower marginal propensity to consume means that the rich have a higher marginal propensity to save and invest some have criticized modern monetary theory as a solution in search of a problem there is one problem that modern monetary theory might be able to address many have pointed out the problem posed by the increasing amount that the federal government is projected to spend on interest on the growing national debt the congressional budget office baseline projects that the net interest payments as a percent of gdp will about double by 2029 as compared to 2018 net interest outlays were 325 billion in 2018 and the cbo projects they will be 928 billion in 2029 in comparison defense spending was 622 billion in 2018 and the cbo projects they will be 771 billion in 2029 the cbo baseline also has debt held by the public as a percent of gdp growing from 77 8 in 2018 to 92 7 the seeking alpha article the federal budget update published february 11 2019 pointed out that in the cbo baseline projections understate the deficits and debt because they must use current law assumptions that are unrealistic such unrealistic assumptions include that the sequester rules will constrain both defense and non defense discretionary spending these caps have been abused but they have not been repealed and they are scheduled to be re imposed after 2019 cbo projects that real discretionary spending will decline over the forecast period but if discretionary spending were to increase with inflation more than 2 trillion would be added to the cumulative deficit there is also the issue of mandatory programs where spending very likely will continue beyond their expiration dates these include supplemental nutrition assistance and veterans compensation cost of living adjustments among others there are also the cbo assumptions that many tax breaks that were temporarily extended periodically will expire as scheduled in current law and that the personal tax cuts contained in the 2017 tax bill will expire after 2025 in the above mentioned article we estimated that using realistic assumptions debt held by the public as a percent of gdp would be 108 of gdp many observers consider the growing federal net interest expenses a serious problem one thing we can be sure of is the net interest expenses are not growing in japan and counties in europe where government debt carries negative or near zero interest rates as long as new government issued debt has negative or near zero interest rates total interest expenses must decline as the new debt replaces maturing old debt with non zero interest rates this is true no matter how large the deficits are and how much new debt the governments issue a basic premise of modern monetary theory is that governments need not incur any interest expenses to finance their deficits some modern monetary theory advocates say that money is like a zero interest perpetual government bond they essentially advocate doing what lincoln did by issuing greenbacks to finance the civil war unlike other paper issued prior to that the greenbacks had no explicit or implied promise to ever redeem them in gold or silver the greenbacks were legal tender that could be used to pay all public debts later the legal tender status was extended for all debts public and private the 2015 seeking alpha article thoughts on negative interest rates discussed some of the problems that negative interest might eventually cause these included the likelihood of a crime spree as burglars raided the homes of cash hoarders for the most part none of these problems seemed to have occurred in those countries with negative interest rates most of the criticism of modern monetary theory seems to focus on almost silly issues they point to the problem of how to price private sector debt securities which they say have always been priced in relation to treasuries even assuming that all private sector debt securities are always priced in relation to treasuries that would not preclude credit and liquidity spreads still being used to price private debt relative to treasuries negative interest rates in japan and europe do not seem to have interfered with the pricing and trading of all types of bonds traded in those countries negative interest rates did cause some issues with some adjustable rate loans in countries like spain portugal and italy the base interest rate applied to many loans especially mortgages is the euro interbank offered rate or euribor portugal s central bank ruled that banks would be required to pay interest on existing loans if euribor plus any additional spread falls below zero the central bank however said lenders are free to take precautionary measures in future contracts more than 90 of the 2 3 million mortgages outstanding in portugal had variable rates that are linked to euribor any new mortgage or loan contracts being written anywhere in the world will now very likely contain a clause stating that the interest rate on the loan cannot be negative regardless of the level of the benchmark rate much of the criticism of modern monetary theory is aimed at refuting the claims made by some advocates that government deficits increase gdp and productivity comparing gdp growth and productivity of different countries with different deficits seems like a fairly useless exercise either way the key question is what would the gdp growth and productivity of a country have been if alternative fiscal policies had been pursued that is very difficult to assess using data from different countries as the required all else equal condition is very far from being met modern monetary theory specifically states that if an economy is overheating inflation can be controlled by having the government run a surplus this would be a conventional keynesian remedy it would also be consistent with monetarism to the extent that a premise of modern monetary theory is that when the government spends more than it takes in from taxes it is creating money thus a government surplus destroys money a criticism of modern monetary theory is that it implies that government should run fiscal deficits until reaching full employment if anyone knew for sure when the point full employment is reached running deficits until that point is reached could actually seem a logical policy some modern monetary theory critics focus on some of the other policies that some advocates of modern monetary theory are associated with these include free college job guarantees for all and medicare for all one could argue that modern monetary theory adoption could facilitate additional borrowing and spending however modern monetary theory itself should be considered separately from issues of how much the government spends in any particular area the fact that stephanie kelton and alexandria ocasio cortez have favorable attitudes towards modern monetary theory does not imply that they would be happy to see the government spend borrowed money on a wall at the mexican border likewise proponents of the wall at the mexican border could use modern monetary theory as a positive reason for building the wall the question is to what extent the experience of protracted negative or close to zero interest rates in numerous developed counties could suggest that modern monetary theory is a theory that may be applicable to a subset of major free market countries at the present time that modern monetary theory would clearly be not applicable to many other countries and at many other times should not be the only relevant criteria modern monetary theory or even perception that modern monetary theory is being considered could boost mreits and leveraged etns stranger things have happened in the last three years than adoption of modern monetary theory either explicitly or implicitly by the united states in the usa adopting a modern monetary theory approach would not even require new legislation if the federal reserve agreed to cut the federal funds target rate to zero and the treasury only issued short term treasury bills to finance the deficits that would effectively implement much of modern monetary theory some prominent modern monetary theory advocates say that all that would be necessary would be for the federal funds rate be permanently set to zero to fully implement modern monetary theory the current experience of japan and some european countries suggests that the treasury would not even have to limit issuance to short term treasury bills but could issue longer term bonds with negative or near zero interest rates when a government issues bonds with negative interest rates those debt securities become a revenue generator rather than an expense if indeed bonds could be issued at with negative or near zero interest rates it might make sense to lengthen the maturity of the debt held by the public where significant amounts of treasury debt is held by foreigners this would have the advantage of reducing the claims of foreigners on future government revenue conventional wisdom suggests that governments can only control short term interest rates but not long term rates furthermore most think that artificially depressing short term rates by a central bank eventually increases long term rates the extended existence of negative 10 year government bond rates in europe could put that conventional wisdom in doubt if long and short term government interest rates in america were at the close to zero or negative levels of those in germany and other european countries the prices of existing securities issued by the federal government and us government agencies and instrumentalities would soar the agency mortgage backed securities held by many mreits would soar in value while initially agency mreits would benefit from zero interest rates on government securities eventually their business model might have to change existing agency mortgage backed securities would likely experience massive prepayments it would be likely that the federal government might curtain or end federally guaranteed mortgages if the interest rate on long term federally guaranteed mortgages that remained was close to zero there might not be any way for mreits to get any income for owning them this could force all mreits to take some credit risk by owning non agency mortgage backed securities in order to achieve any net income a partial adoption of modern monetary theory where only short term risk free rates were set at or close to zero would benefit all leveraged securities especially 2x leveraged high yield etns as both the components in the indexes upon which they are based would soar in price and their borrowing costs would decline analysis of the may 2019 reml dividend projection my projected may 2019 reml monthly dividend of 0 2474 is a function of the calendar most of the reml components pay dividends quarterly typically with ex dates in the last month of the quarter and payment dates in the first month of the next quarter the january april october and july big month reml dividends are much larger than the small month dividends paid in the other months thus the 0 2474 reml dividend paid in may 2019 will be a small month dividend as can be seen in the table below only five of the reml components agnc investment corp agnc colony credit real estate clnc armour residential reit arr orchid island nyse orc and dynex capital inc dx now pay dividends monthly there are some of the quarterly payers that will however contribute to the may 2019 dividend new residential investment corp nrz has an ex date of 4 3 2019 pennymac mortgage investment pmt has an ex date of 4 12 2019 hannon armstrong sustainable infrastructure capital inc hasi has an ex date of 4 2 2019 thus those quarterly payers will also contribute to the may 2019 dividend that for quarterly payers will contribute to the may 2019 reml dividend will make the may 2019 dividend the highest small month dividend ever the previous highest small month dividend was the 0 1587 august 2018 reml dividend the table below shows the ticker name weight dividend and ex date for all of the components additionally the table includes the price and contribution to the dividend for the reml components that will contribute to the may 2019 dividend my projection for the april 2019 reml monthly dividend of 0 99 is calculated using the contribution by component method the table below shows the ticker name weight dividend and ex date for all of the components additionally it includes the price and contribution to the dividend for the reml components that will contribute to the may 2019 reml monthly dividend the ishares mortgage real estate capped etf rem is a fund based on the same index as reml rather than a note and does not employ the 2x leverage that reml does rem also pays dividends quarterly rather than monthly as a fund the dividend is discretionary by the fund management as long as it distributes the required percentage of taxable income to maintain its investment company status thus it does not lend itself to contribution by component dividend projections as an etn like reml which must pay dividends pursuant to an indenture conclusions and recommendations i cannot say that i had modern monetary theory in mind or had even heard of it when formed my opinion on mreits and 2x leveraged high yield etns my view regarding the federal reserve has been a significant aspect of my decision to buy mreits and then 2x leveraged mreit etns when morl appeared in 2013 in 2013 the recovery from the financial crisis that began in 2007 was well underway many were forecasting that much higher interest rates were imminent my contrarian view was based in part on my opinion that the federal reserve was not artificially depressing short term risk free interest rates but rather was preventing them from declining even more in 2013 i said in my article federal reserve actually propping up interest rates what this means for mreits most investors now believe three things about the federal reserve money and interest rates they think that the federal reserve is artificially depressing rates below what would be a normal level they believe that in the process of doing so the federal reserve has enormously increased the supply of money and they believe that the usa is on a fiat money system all three of those beliefs are incorrect i updated that article on august 23 2018 with federal reserve actually propping up interest rates what this means for mreits an update which presented new evidence supporting my original conclusions that the federal reserve has been and still is keeping interest rates higher than what a free market in risk free short term fixed income securities would be recently some seem to be adopting in part my view on the federal reserve regarding short term interest rates chairman powell has indicated that the federal reserve is no longer anticipating any increases in short term interest rates newly nominated federal reserve governor stephen moore has called for the federal reserve to cut interest rates by half a percentage point when i wrote my original article in 2013 moore was adamant that the federal reserve needed to raise interest rates much faster and more than they actually did interest rates are the key determinant of both the dividends paid and the share prices of mreits and thus are the major source of risk for morl mrrl and reml interest rates are even more important because of the 2x leverage the spread between the longer term interest rates paid by the mortgage backed securities held by the mreits and the shorter term rates they pay on the borrowing they do to finance their mortgage backed securities generates the income that s used to pay their dividends morl mrrl and reml add another level of leverage and effectively borrow at an interest rate based on three month libor in order to increase their monthly distributions i doubt that the federal reserve or any other american government entity will explicitly adopt modern monetary theory anytime soon however in europe there has not been much explicit support for adoption of modern monetary theory while the prolonged period of near zero and negative interest rates suggests that some of the policy prescriptions of modern monetary theory can be implemented without any official recognition of modern monetary theory as long as the central bank asserts such policies are only temporary this should be taken into account by investors i am still willing to collect the very high yields that reml mrrl and morl pay while waiting to see if my views of the future course of interest rates and economic conditions prevail the emergence of modern monetary theory as something possibly on the radar screens of investors makes me somewhat more willing own the 2x leveraged high yield mreit etns those views include that despite all of the risks posed by the exploding federal budget deficit the massive shift in the tax burden away from the rich and onto the middle class will eventually bring interest rates down this argument is based on the fact that the wealthy clearly have a lower marginal propensity to consume than do the non rich my rationale was explained in the seeking alpha article a depression with benefits the macro case for mreits there are a number of risks to the financial markets that were not much on anyone s radar a few years ago these include protectionism all trade restrictions result in dead weight loss which occurs when the benefits to the favored entities are always less than the costs to the many losers who pay higher prices on balance this makes the entire population poorer protectionism would result in higher input costs and shift the aggregate supply curve to the left the resulting higher inflation would inevitably increase interest rates and depress economic activity see trump s trade policies america s brexit a discussion of the risks of protectionism a new set of risks that i had not previously considered particularly relevant has arisen since the 2018 election there are some newly elected democrats and others that appear to be favoring far left policies that have previously been tried and subsequently been rejected and reversed to a major extent in countries such as france sweden and the netherlands it is unlikely that these could ever be enacted in the united states however many things have taken place in the last few years that may have previously been considered unlikely these far left policies such as increasing the minimum wage to a level where a large portion of the workforce is covered by it as is the case in france are distinct from adopting modern social welfare policies that are in place in every developed country except for america such as controlling health care prices see single payer medicare for all and the investment implications addressing the acceleration in inequality caused by the tax code is not just a concern of those on the left there is a growing view that the 2017 tax bill went too far in what warren buffett ceo of berkshire hathaway brk a brk b was describing when he said that through the tax code there has been class warfare waged and my class has won it s been a rout whatever one thinks of the advisability of enacting legislation that reverses the massive shift in the tax burden onto the middle class and away from the rich it could have negative implications for the financial markets since shifting the tax burden from the rich and onto the middle class results in there being more funds being available for investment reversing that results in less funds being available for investment my focus in this article is not to examine the merits or feasibility of these proposals or if the amounts that advocates claim would be raised from such taxes on the rich are accurate i do think there is a reasonable likelihood that the 2020 democratic nominee for president will be someone who favors to a greater or less extent something along the lines of the tax the rich plans being recently proposed by sanders warren and ocasio cortez among others the probability of the 2020 election resulting in a change in the tax code that significantly reverses the massive shift in the in the tax burden away from the rich and onto the middle class is still very probably low as long as the democrats continue to combine such tax proposals with plans to spend the proceeds on various social programs like free college tuition however a plan to raise taxes on those with assets above 50 million and or incomes above 10 million and use all of the proceeds to reduce the taxes on everyone else might have a much higher probability of being enacted it is hard to envision the democrats being politically savvy or ideologically flexible enough to embrace a policy of directly shifting the tax burden away from the middle class and onto the rich rather than using the proceeds of taxes on the rich for spending programs the democrats have generally been deluded in their belief that the current level of taxes on the middle class is politically sustainable in hilary clinton s speech announcing her candidacy she said that the middle class pays too much taxes she never mentioned a middle class tax cut again presumably due to pressure from sanders who pushed her to the left which severely hurt her chances in the general election most democrat politicians are not aware that by far the best thing government could do for most middle class households would be to lower their taxes thus in many cases middle class voters have been willing to grasp at any chance they think could lower their tax burden and thus support candidates who promise them a tax cut no matter how odious the candidates might be otherwise regarding reml one item that should be addressed relates to the possibility of early redemption or the lack thereof some comments in seeking alpha articles have asserted that while morl and mrrl can be called reml cannot i do not consider that among the valid reason to switch from morl to reml fidelity does not allow new purchases of any of the ubs 2x leveraged etns such as morl and mrrl but does allow new purchases reml for now conversations with people at fidelity seem to have led some to believe that reml cannot be called this is not correct as can be seen from the reml prospectus our call right on any business day through and including the maturity date we may at our option call all but not less than all of the issued and outstanding etns to exercise our call right we must provide notice to the holders of the etns the call notice not less than sixteen 16 calendar days prior to the call settlement date specified in the

report of march personal income and consumption data will not tell us anything new and were contained in the pre weekend report however the monthly pce deflator and core deflator are important data points although there is some confusion over it the fed s 2 target applies to the headline pce deflator not the core rate as recently as january the fomc affirmed that it judged that an inflation rate

in an analysis note joachim fels from pimco said the three key cycles that drive the direction of asset markets the business liquidity and political cycles have begun to diverge in 2019 markets have priced in a federal reserve rate cut for global liquidity and deteriorations in the political cycle while clear signs of a rebound are still lacking the global business cycle has likely stopped deteriorating china s purchasing manager indices ticked up in march the european pmis have been bumping along the bottom in recent months and advance estimates of first quarter us gdp came in higher year over year fels wrote with china s credit and fiscal stimulus likely to find more traction in the coming months and global financial conditions having eased substantially since the start of 2019 a moderate recovery in global growth in the second half of the year appears to be in the cards however global risk assets will most likely lack a clear direction this year and could become more volatile

canadian prime minister justin trudeau said beef exports to japan nearly tripled trudeau added the pact has benefited tremendously canadian citizens japanese citizens and businesses and indeed people throughout the region and that stands in stark contrast with the united states withdrawal continuing to move forward on freer more open trade according to the rules we can all agree on is something we

abe last friday the us and japan are still working on a trade deal trump said the deal can go fairly quickly and negotiations are moving along very nicely and we ll see what happens he also said we ll

overview it promises to be an eventful week with the fomc and boe meeting us jobs report and emu april cpi and q1 gdp on tap however the week is marked by the may day holiday in the middle of the week japan s markets are closed all week while china s markets are closed from mid week on for an extended holiday the week has begun on a decidedly consolidative tone equity markets in asia pacific were mixed the shanghai composite fell for the third consecutive day and has moved lower five of the past six sessions european equities are slightly firmer to start the week and us shares are little changed benchmark 10 year yields are mostly one two basis points firmer but the yields in the european periphery of lower one two basis points lower including italy bbb rating affirmed by s p with a negative outlook and spain election will likely produce a center left government that depends on support from a moderate party from catalonia the dollar appeared to be the victim of buy the rumor sell the fact after the stronger than expected q1 gdp estimate and it continues to consolidate its recent gains with a mostly heavier bias in emerging markets the turkish lira is weaker with the dollar nearing try6 0 the korean won which was sold every day last week has steadied today though the tone remains vulnerable after the surprise contraction in q1 gdp asia pacific japanese markets are closed through may 6 for an extended golden week holiday and the ascension of a new emperor emperor akihito is the first abdication in japan in 202 years the crown prince naruhito will be the new emperor the absence of local liquidity may be reinforcing and encourage others to be sidelined if they can separately it appears that japan pushed back gently against us hopes for an early harvest by granting us farmers the same access that has been granted europe and tpp members reports indicate that that the us offered no concessions like phasing out levies on light trucks auto and parts as agreed under the tpp trump reportedly would like an agreement on some low hanging fruit in time for his visit to japan at the end of the next month this does not seem particularly likely japan wants a comprehensive deal that will exempt them from auto tariffs that have been threatened japan will host the g20 meeting in june and the upper house election is in july for the first time in a week the dollar did not trade above jpy112 00 an option for about 645 mln struck there will roll off today without tokyo markets the range has been about a quarter of a yen above jpy111 55 the australian dollar is trying to extend its recovery recall that last thursday it was sold below 0 7000 but rebounded ahead of the close and rose further ahead of the weekend to about 0 7060 it seemed to signal this consolidative phase for the us dollar the more important technical hurdle is seen from 0 7075 0 7100 with a few exceptions the dollar continues to be confined to a cny6 70 cny6 75 range against china s yuan europe spain went to the polls for the third time in four years the socialists will likely lead a center left government that includes support from some regionalist parties though it may take a little while to sort things out the socialists 123 seats and the populist left podemos 43 seats leaves them about 10 seats shy of a majority there are two catalan parties and one from basque country since 2015 span has enjoyed among the strongest emu economies it is expected to have grown by 0 6 in q1 matching the pace of each quarter in 2018 it will be reported on tuesday s p maintained its bbb rating on italy it is not surprising but the risks remain the negative outlook was maintained many talk and write as if italy s suffers fiscal excesses but that is an old story and has not been true for many years its debt was accumulated before and what it suffers from mostly now is the lack of growth as long as growth is below the average interest rate it pays italy s debt increases growth is very much in the news this week after contracting in the last two quarters of last year most are looking for a 0 1 gain in q1 gdp which will be reported on april 30 disappointment will translate into larger deficit projections italy s 10 year premium over germany widened to two month highs last week near 2 70 and remember germany s 10 year yield is a little below zero finally there is something that can challenge brexit for mindshare before the weekend uk chancellor hammond was in china a few days after the british government announced that it would allow huawei to participate in non core parts for the 5g infrastructure and he was enthusiastically endorsing the belt road initiative as a truly epic vision as opposed to a vehicle to project a competing governance and value system even though this runs against us wishes and the recent eu statement it is consistent with uk policy osborne hammond s predecessor sought to make the uk china s best friend in the west the euro is holding in the upper half of the pre weekend range it has been mostly confined to 1 1140 1 1170 there are 650 mln euros in an option at 1 1150 and another 870 mln euros at 1 1200 both expire today chart resistance is seen in the 1 1180 1 1200 area and a move above there would likely confirm a low is in place just ahead of 1 1100 sterling has risen marginally through the pre weekend high of a little more than 1 2940 resistance is seen in the 1 2960 1 2980 in front of the psychologically important 1 30 we suspect that north american participants may look to sell into the modest upticks america the optics of q1 us gdp 3 2 annualized pace was better than the details consumption was halved to 1 2 from 2 5 in q4 18 and the gdp deflator was also halved to 0 9 from 1 7 inventories and net exports mostly because of a decline in imports accounted for half of the growth nevertheless the fed s assessment in march that the economy slowed from its solid rate looks somewhat out of place today s report of march personal income and consumption data will not tell us anything new and were contained in the pre weekend report however the monthly pce deflator and core deflator are important data points although there is some confusion over it the fed s 2 target applies to the headline pce deflator not the core rate as recently as january the fomc affirmed that it judged that an inflation rate of 2 as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures is most consistent over the longer run with the federal reserve statutory mandate canada reports its february monthly gdp estimate tomorrow it is likely to be flat after a 0 3 expansion in january the year over year rate is expected to slow to 1 4 from 1 6 the contrast with the us is stark the us dollar rallied cad1 3520 in the middle of last week in response to the somewhat more neutral central bank comments it pulled back toward cad1 3450 before the weekend but it is testing the cad1 3470 area ahead of the north american open in a move that began last week oil prices continue to pare their recent gains and the mixed equities may not be helping disclaimer
at a time when the appeal of and demands for a new democratic socialism seem to have caught the imagination of many among the young and are reflected in the promises of a good number of political candidates running for high office there is one already existing socialist institution in america with few opponents the federal reserve system the fact is central banking is a form of central planning the federal reserve has a legal monopoly over the monetary system of the united states it plans the quantity of money in circulation and its availability for lending purposes and it sets a target for the annual rate of price inflation currently around 2 percent while also intentionally influencing interest rates affecting investment spending and supporting full employment almost all discussions and debates concerning the federal reserve revolve around how it should undertake its monetary central planning which policy tools should be used what target goals should be aimed for and who should be in charge of directing america s central bank federal reserve independence in the trump era a complementary issue that has received renewed attention concerns the question of how much independence the federal reserve and other central banks should have to determine and implement monetary and interest rate policy this has recently come to the fore due to comments made by president donald trump concerning federal reserve interest rate policy and the individuals he has recently proposed for positions on the federal reserve board of governors several times over the last year president trump has expressed irritation and frustration with increases in market rates of interest under the federal reserve board leadership of jerome powell who trump nominated for fed chairman and who has held that position since february 2018 trump has publicly pouted and whined that while barack obama was president he had a central bank that gave him rock bottom low interest rates fed chairman powell on the other hand has raised interest rates several times over the last year preventing america from being as great as trump thinks it can be because of the higher costs of borrowing for both the private sector and the federal government being informed that he really cannot just fire chairman powell because he doesn t like federal reserve policies trump wants to get around the powell problem by nominating for open positions on the fed board those he thinks will more likely direct federal reserve policies in the way he wants thus he has put up as names for senate approval those of stephen moore a policy analyst at the heritage foundation and a former trump campaign advisor and herman cain the former ceo of godfather s pizza a previous chairman of the kansas city branch of the federal reserve and a past republican presidential hopeful himself trump critics on the left on the right and at the economist trump has been attacked from both the left and the right for seeming to want to pack the federal reserve board of governors with political types reflecting trump s desire for looser monetary policy and lower interest rates some on the political left oppose his nominees simply because well they are trump s choices along with the additional criticisms that neither are ph d economists nor known and respected experts on monetary policy others more to the political right don t want them on the board because they would prefer a more hawkish fed policy desmond lachman a resident scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute thinks the federal reserve should raise interest rates so the central bank will have the room for future successful monetary stimulus policies when the next economy wide downturn comes along in other words he just wants monetary central planning in a different direction than president trump the economist magazine had as its cover topic for the april 13 2019 issue the threat to central bank independence from trump and others like him in charge of governments around the world what is needed and has to be preserved the economist argues are professional monetary planning technocrats who rise above and are free from interference by politicians so those at the central banking helm can focus on long run price level stability and non ideological banking and interest rate policies the magazine admits that central bankers have not always gotten it right even the most well intentioned central planner is only human let s not forget but in their wise hands the world has been saved from destabilizing price inflations and short run policy manipulations that might have been harmful to full employment and steady growth the austrian critique of central planning vs markets rarely heard or suggested in all these commentaries on the federal reserve is whether the united states needs or should have a central bank i would like to suggest that the answer is no and for many of the same reasons that can be made against socialist central planning in general it will be 100 years in 2020 since the austrian economist ludwig von mises first published his famous critique of socialist central planning in his article economic calculation in the socialist commonwealth 1920 and then extended the challenge to all facets of collectivism in his 1922 book socialism an economic and sociological analysis the gist of his argument was that a centrally planned economy did away with the essential institutions necessary for rational economic calculation private property in the means of production market competition and a functioning price system in a complex and ever changing social system of division of labor all the multitudes of participants are interdependent for all the things needed for everyday life it is necessary to have some means of knowing what it is that people want to buy in their role as consumers and the value they place on those things and it is also essential to know what resources are available out of which desired consumer goods might be produced and what their values might be in the alternative uses for which they could be applied in other words do consumers desire hats or shoes or bananas or breakfast cereal or classical music or serious books on economics or anything else and what are the relative values they may place on possibly purchasing them at the same time what are the available types and quantities of labor land resources and raw materials and capital goods machinery tools equipment that may be used in various combinations to produce those consumer items and what might be their appraised values in being employed in different and competing lines of production market prices and economic calculation the market solves that problem mises explained through the emergence of a competitive price system for both finished goods and the factors of production with exchangeable private property there are opportunities to buy and sell with the ability to buy and sell people have motives and incentives to make bids and offers to each other out of those bids and offers may arise agreed upon terms of trade and those agreed upon terms of trade create the complex structure of relative prices for both those finished goods and the factors of production in a complex market system there also historically emerged a medium of exchange to overcome the hurdles of direct barter transactions to better facilitate the buying and selling of virtually everything as the most widely used and generally accepted medium of exchange the commodity that becomes the money good comes to be on one side of every exchange people trade their goods for money and then trade away that money for other goods they desire to buy almost every good and service on the market therefore comes to have a money price that then enables an ease of economic calculation through which all the physically heterogeneous goods offered on the market may be expressed in a single valuational common denominator the money prices for everything thus all traders on the market can readily do their comparison shopping what would this bundle of consumer items cost me to buy and what are the relative costs if i substitute one good for another to buy instead if i buy one hat for 10 then i have to forgo the equivalent of two pairs of gloves that cost 5 a piece the same applies on the supply side of market production decisions the entrepreneur can try to make an informed judgment concerning what a consumer good sells for in the present and might possibly sell for in the future if he were to bring some quantity of it to market likewise he can determine what it would cost to rent hire or purchase alternative combinations of inputs labor land capital to manufacture some such consumer item on the basis of which he can decide whether he thinks that doing so would be a profit making or a loss making endeavor and if seeming to be profitable which combination of those inputs would minimize his costs of production to potentially maximize the anticipated and hoped for profits central planning leads to planned chaos a system of socialist central planning does away with all of this with government nationalization of the means of production there is nothing to legally buy and sell on the production side of the economy with nothing to buy and sell there are obviously no bids or offers for the factors of production with no bids and offers for labor land resources and capital there are no market based prices for appraising profitable from unprofitable lines of production and deciding which alternative ways of making finished goods would minimize the costs of production it is not surprising that a bit more than a quarter of a century after mises first offered his criticisms of socialist central planning he titled a short monograph on the same theme planned chaos 1947 without market based and competitively generated prices to assist the ongoing process of rational economic calculation in a changing world the central planners would be flying blind in trying to decide what to produce and how to produce it to get the most out of the scarce factors of production in value terms in supplying the goods and services consumers actually might want to buy and what they would have been willing to pay for them see my article why socialism is impossible most economists around today would find the gist of this argument fairly obvious if asked to agree with it or not even if many mainstream economists would no doubt insist that there were problems of monopoly and undersupplied public goods and assert the need for various redistributive welfare programs outside of the arena of market exchange due to income inequalities but the notion that market based competitive prices enable effective and cost efficient economic calculation for much that goes on in a complex society would be accepted in this general formulation without too much disagreement central banking denies freedom of choice in money on this basis i would argue that monetary central planning in the form of central banking creates many of the same problems for economic calculation and effective and efficient use of resources as traditional socialist economic planning first of all what commodity or commodities should be used as a medium or media of exchange under our current monetary system anyone who attempts to offer and market alternative monies for use in domestic transactions is subject to legal penalty including arrest and imprisonment for instance back in the late 1990s bernard von nothaus decided to mint and market an alternative private voluntary currency for business and related transactions in 2009 mr nothous was arrested for circulating millions of his gold coins called liberty dollars in over 80 cities on counterfeiting charges and for undertaking a conspiracy against the u s government s monetary monopoly he was found guilty in 2011 and in 2014 he was given six months house arrest and three years probation in 2018 mr nothous was back this time saying that he was starting up a cryptocurrency that was to be 100 percent backed by silver how the government responds this time to his attempt to undermine america s socialist monetary system remains to be seen but the fact is how can any government and even the wisest and most ph d ed of their federal reserve experts know what people in the marketplace would find attractive advantageous and profitable to use as a medium of exchange in market transactions or whether there might not be a demand for different types of money for different forms of market activities the answer is that there is no way of fully knowing this other than allowing private enterprisers and entrepreneurs in the financial and other everyday markets to competitively discover and offer what we the buying and selling public might want for this purpose it is now more than 40 years since austrian economist f a hayek published his choice in currency 1976 in which he called for the simple monetary reform of ending legal tender laws and allowing people to choose and use in domestic and foreign transactions any medium of exchange they desire he considered this a necessary freedom to break the history of abuse under government monopoly money and to allow people to use whatever money they want only markets can discover the optimal amount of money second how can the monetary central planners know how much money should be in circulation and in the banking system this is no more possible than the old soviet central planners knowing how much toilet paper to produce or the quantities and varieties of any other everyday household necessity what the soviet planners produced invariably turned out to be in the wrong amounts and of the wrong types a visit to a people s lingerie store and i use this term very loosely in moscow before the collapse of the soviet union found one size fits all in women s underpants any needed adjustment of the waistband well comrade that is what safety pins are for no unnecessary quantities or wasteful duplication under bright and beautiful socialist planning the central planners were no doubt soviet socialism s best and brightest and with ph d s under a commodity money such as gold in a fully free enterprise system the amount of money in the market is a reflection of supply and demand people have uses for gold for either commercial or monetary purposes gold has its price in the marketplace based on this those on the supply side could estimate the profitability of prospecting mining minting and marketing greater quantities of produced gold for sale for monetary and other commercial uses an increased demand for gold as money sees a shift of the commodity from commercial uses to monetary ones and with the resulting rise in the value of gold in general a greater profitability from gold prospecting mining and minting as the supply increases the rise in the market value of gold is tempered with the increasing supply tending to satisfy the greater demand yes there have been noticeable gold based fluctuations due to newly discovered gold sources in various parts of the world but in general these incidents have been few and far between with gold annually being extracted from known pockets based on current and trend demand the crucial element in this is that the optimal quantity of money is the interactive outcome of the market participants themselves the gold market provides the price system that reflects the demand for gold in its various uses of which money is one and the related markets for the needed means of production to mine mint and supply gold provide the cost prices that facilitate the rational economic calculations for an ever adapting and ever adjusting optimal market guided quantity of money see my article government gold and separating money from the state the central bankers determine how much money today we are dependent on the decisions of a handful of central planning executives on the board of governors of the federal reserve what is their guide the personal judgments of what they think the economy needs based upon the prevailing macroeconomic theories used in the central bank about how the economy works and therefore how much money should be pumped into the banking system our monetary fate is dependent upon whether the central bank experts this year are old style keynesians new keynesians monetarists new classical economists taylor rule followers supply siders new modern monetary theorists or any number of other possibilities in the old soviet union it all depended upon whether stalinists or trotskyites were to be in charge for the central planning of scientific research genetics was or was not considered compatible with marxism leninism as interpreted by the leadership of the party just as it is said that central banking needs to be independent so the objective and scientific monetary experts can guide the economy based on the latest and correct macroeconomic models it was insisted under soviet and all other socialisms in practice that it was all objective and scientific being based on marxian dialectical materialism given what that meant in any particular situation it s all a politics and ideology of planning a few say they know what is right for the many and will use government to give it to them the false target of 2 percent price inflation also important to keep in mind is that there is no optimal rate of price inflation to begin with any benchmark meant to determine whether prices in general are rising or falling is based upon some statistical averaging of selected and weighted individual prices tracked through time to determine whether or not a constructed and imaginary basket of goods has become more expensive or less expensive and if so by what percentage amount from an earlier point in time changes in the cost of living affect each of us differently based on the reality of what we as individuals and separate households choose to buy and in what relative amounts also our individual baskets are not invariant points of comparison even for ourselves since changes in our tastes and preferences in the relative prices among the goods we buy and in the market s offering of new and better quality goods on a frequent basis all bring about changes in what goods are in our respective baskets and their relative quantities such statistical creations as the consumer price index are at most very rough and ready general pieces of information for the consumer or citizen concerning what the central bank may be doing to the overall value of the money we use the fact is its importance is not for you or me but as one of the signals used by the central bankers to decide the rate of monetary expansion and for influencing interest rates see my articles the consumer price index a false indicator of our individual costs of living and the false promises of controlled 2 percent inflation it s all based on a macroeconomic conception that in general a falling price level is bad and that growth and employment are stimulated by modestly rising prices it has fallen mostly though not exclusively to the austrian school over the last 100 years to demonstrate that falling prices due to greater outputs and supply side cost efficiencies are not only not harmful to the wealth and health of modern society but are an indication of increasing prosperity and rising real standards of living see my article don t fear deflation unless caused by government likewise whether it is the attempt to maintain a relatively stable general level of prices as partly guided federal reserve policy in the 1920s or the contemporary central bank target of 2 percent price inflation the primary institutional tool at the federal reserve s disposal is to buy u s government securities and now a variety of other market assets including mortgaged backed securities during the financial crisis of 2008 9 and after and to increase loanable reserves in the banking system see my article austrian monetary theory vs federal reserve inflation targeting this becomes the means for influencing interest rates for investment and all other types of borrowing to try to stimulate spending and employment in the economy as a whole even the fed s latest policy trick since the financial crisis to pay banks not to lend the very trillions of dollars of excess reserves the central bank pumped into the banking system is a way for the federal reserve to try to influence interest rates and aggregate spending in the economy the fact is interest rates should be left free and competitive to do their job as the network of intertemporal prices connecting and coordinating the savings decisions of lenders with the investment choices of borrowers in other words interest rates are the prices that are supposed to bring markets and the use of the factors of production into balance with each other across time instead by viewing and using interest rates as a policy tool to be manipulated the federal reserve s monetary central planners only succeed in distorting and preventing interest rates from telling the truth how much savings is in the economy to sustain and maintain a structure of gross and net investments with varying time horizons see my article interest rates need to tell the truth just as soviet central planners may have believed that they could coordinate it all for better and more successful outcomes than market economies our central bankers never fail in their enthusiasm and arrogant confidence that this time they will get it right that they now have the right macroeconomic model of how it all works they finally have bigger and better statistical data and computer capacity to successfully read and measure the entrails of the economic goose see my articles macro aggregates hide the real market processes at work and the myth of aggregate demand and supply what they in fact bring about are the inflations and recessions the booms and busts that they insist they are in the central banking business to moderate if not to prevent by their fruits you will know them the post world war i inflation and depression the 1920s false promise of prosperity and stability followed by the great depression the booms and busts of inflations and recessions in the 1950s the monetary inflation of the 1960s and especially the high price inflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s then a relative calm in the 1990s but followed by the monetary expansion between 2003 and 2008 that set the stage for the great financial and housing crisis of 2008 10 and now the great experiment with quantitative easing and the ballooning federal reserve asset portfolio filled with private sector mortgages see my article ten years on recession recovery and the regulatory state the long history of central banking and especially over the last 100 years of paper monies and out of control government deficit spending partly funded by monetization of the debt has more than clearly demonstrated that the epoch of modern central banking needs to come to an end and in its place we need the opening and freeing of financial markets to private competitive free banking with markets meaning all of us deciding what we want to use as money see my ebook monetary central planning and the state
published monday 29 april 2019 print disqus monetary hockey stick killer debt dominoes dropping washington dc dallas and puerto rico the us europe and most of the developed world on are the road to japanification like i wrote last week we will see financial repression ever increasing deficits slower growth etc essentially the rest of us will begin to look like japan with its astronomical deficits and ultra dovish monetary policy i tried to emphasize this is not the end of the world it s not the best world either but we ve gone too far to come back now there is no significant constituency for any of the things it would take for the us government to balance its budget neither party wants to reduce the deficit and the mmt fans want to make it even bigger that means the rules of investing we have come to know over the last 50 years are likely as in very very likely to change but we should generally do fine as long as we change our own investment strategies accordingly ben hunt over at epsilon theory recently riffed on stanley kubrick s 1964 masterpiece dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb he did a great parody with it called modern monetary theory how i learned to stop worrying and love the national debt source wikimedia could we actually see modern monetary theory in the us lacy hunt in his latest quarterly explains how it is theoretically possible for the treasury department to issue zero maturity zero interest bonds to the fed which would then deposit dollars into the treasury bank account this would at a minimum create inflation and possibly hyperinflation to say it would be destructive is like comparing an ocean breeze to a category five hurricane it would in fact be a financial disaster of biblical proportions i don t believe it will happen that way though we will instead run up debt the old fashioned way japanification and massive amounts of quantitative easing let s look at how that might play out the financial times has a very helpful graph using congressional budget office data showing the deficit as a percentage of gdp both in the past and forecast for the next 10 years you can see the underlying cbo report here when you realize that the gdp is well over 20 trillion now and the cbo projects the gdp to grow this chart visually understates the reality of growing deficits let s look at another helpful chart which actually shows the dollar amount of the projected deficits source cbo basically the projection is an average annual deficit of 1 2 trillion per year for the next 10 years but there are a few caveats first let s assume away the real world to give the cbo their due they only assume 2 3 gdp growth very mild unemployment growth and roughly 2 inflation but here s the kicker well actually there s two they assume no recession and they make no allowance for the roughly 400 billion per year in off budget expenditures that i described last week the off budget expenditures mean that even without a recession the debt will rise 1 6 trillion per year for the next decade that means the national debt will be 40 trillion by 2029 if as i expect there is a recession we will reach that 40 trillion number sooner sometime in 2026 through 2028 the deficit in a recession will be a minimum of 2 trillion per year and maybe much higher than those suggested above there will be some token movement to reduce spending but it won t make much difference because mandatory spending a euphemism for medicare social security and other entitlement programs plus interest on the debt plus defense spending overwhelms so called discretionary spending here s the cbo chart again in terms of gdp because the absolute numbers would scare you source cbo even if we could cut some discretionary spending the deficits would still be huge as there is no constituency for cutting entitlement programs we will talk about why growth will actually slow under such a scenario in a later letter today s question is where will we get the money to pay for this spending answer the treasury department will sell bonds and run up the debt that s a given then there will be a recession as there always is and then the federal reserve will take interest rates down to the zero boundary otherwise known as financial repression and the devastation of savers followed by unprecedented amounts of quantitative easing just like japan has done again this isn t the end of the world at least if we pursue it that way full on mmt would be much much worse and if i seriously expected it i would be preparing to ride out a hyperinflation scenario but i do not think that will happen is it possible sure the most dangerous thing for investors is to not imagine what could go wrong with their basic thesis hat tip ben hunt right now my base case is for a more or less deflationary world we will explore that and some alternatives at the conference this year which is sold out but you can still get a virtual pass here monetary hockey stick now let s think how we got here the response to the last crisis setup the next one a lot happened in 2007 2009 during which we endured a recession that left little chance for reflection now we have that chance those in authority back then faced enormous pressure to do something letting nature take its course may well have been the best strategy but it couldn t happen that way in our political system they had to act sidebar historical note there was a crash depression in 1920 1921 you never read about it president warren harding simply did nothing and let prices and markets clear it was all over by mid 1921 and we got the roaring 20s no fed or government intervention except the fed did raise interest rates to 7 after inflation world war i so they get a share of the blame and there was the gold standard so no qe was available back to our world in 2008 2009 we got things like tarp the troubled asset relief program that used 431 billion of your money to buy loans that banks no longer wanted on their books the government eventually sold most of them as well as equity warrants received from participating banks so the net cost came out much lower but that wasn t a sure thing what we now forget is that tarp helped banks that weren t even banks before that point goldman sachs morgan stanley and numerous other broker dealers and insurers hurriedly got bank charters specifically so they could be part of tarp the government welcomed it too that s the kind of unpredictable change i described last week but these fiscal and regulatory surprises pale in comparison to the federal reserve s unprecedented monetary actions rate cuts were only part of it and not the most important but they were huge in august 2007 they cut fed funds a quarter point from 5 25 where it had stayed for some time a year later it was down to 2 and soon was effectively zero compare that to the current cycle which spent four years raising the rate from that effectively zero level to the present 2 5 chart st louis fed the fed is perfectly capable of moving rates far more aggressively than we have seen recently and in either direction but the bigger and even more aggressive policy move was in asset purchases which included but weren t limited to quantitative easing when the crisis hit the fed by law could only buy certain kinds of assets treasury securities bank debt federally backed mortgage securities and the like they didn t change the rules but instead stretched them far beyond what anyone envisioned could ever happen chart st louis fed that hockey stick jump in the fed s balance sheet assets wasn t on anyone s radar but it happened the fed then added several more rounds before finally topping out and recently beginning to exit was any of this the end of the world no the markets absorbed it all and even performed well in fact markets performed well because they absorbed all this craziness in that lies the seed of our next cycle killer debt recently i sent over my shoulder members a swiss newspaper interview with my friend william white bill is former chief economist with the bank for international settlements and my favorite central banker he speaks with unusual candor he ll be at the sic by the way and you can hear him by getting a virtual pass in discussing the current move to loosen policy the reporter asked how did we end up in the debt trap bill s answer we were encouraged to do this just think what we have been doing since 2007 monetary easing is an invitation to take on more private sector debt and fiscal expansion is by definition an increase of government debt both instruments carry the risk of higher debt levels that eventually will kill you in the great recession we had both fiscal easing tarp expanded safety net programs etc and monetary easing lower rates asset purchases qe the result exactly as bill said was sharply more government debt and private sector debt that may seem counterintuitive since recessions supposedly bring deleveraging that happened but not uniformly some deleveraged while others added more and the latter group was much larger and the fed s vast liquidity injections enabled it bill went on to explain that debt problems are about solvency but central banks provide liquidity a fractional reserve banking system has a lender of last resort in order to avoid collapse in a bank run bailing out borrowers who can t repay is not its mission or its talent nonetheless under pressure to act the fed and its peers did what they could throw money in all directions hoping some of it would stick some of it did too the new liquidity found its way into assets whose prices then rose enabling more borrowing driving asset prices higher again and here we are according to the institute for international finance global debt was 244 trillion as of q3 2018 more than half of it was financial and non financial corporate debt about 27 65 trillion was government debt not counting unfunded liabilities which are huge source bloomberg household debt was the small category and hasn t grown that much in the us here s a closer look via the new york fed s quarterly survey you can see in the chart how us households retrenched in the recession then began slowly adding more debt in 2013 and after mortgage debt is still slightly below its pre crisis peak corporations did not limit themselves like families did here s nonfinancial corporate debt growth for that same period 2003 2018 source st louis fed the recession shaded area had almost no effect on corporate debt growth which continued merrily higher note that this is only securitized debt much more exists on private books you could argue that the added debt is not so dramatic as a percentage of gdp which also grew in this period that s true but it s also riskier debt the proportion of bonds at junk or near junk status has grown significantly i ve quoted several times now my friend peter boockvar s statement we no longer have business cycles we have credit cycles his point falling asset prices won t be a result of the next recession they will cause the next recession and asset prices will fall when the free flowing credit that pushed them so high recedes which it is doing right now thanks to the fed s two factor experiment of simultaneously hiking interest rates and reversing qe peter will speak at the sic too by the way get your virtual pass the fed is now at least pausing that experiment and appears set to reverse it later this year i fear they are acting too late the latest corporate earnings news and lots of other data suggests the cyclical weakening has begun the next marker will be some high profile debt defaults probably among lower rated issuers i don t know who wework tesla name your favorite but somebody is going to run out of cash and find themselves unable to refinance for the 97th time and then the real fun will begin dominoes dropping years ago i started calling japan a bug in search of a windshield i was certain their economy would go splat as they ran huge government deficits cratered their own currency and had the bank of japan buy every financial asset that wasn t nailed down well the japanese have enthusiastically implemented all those policies i m not going to say it worked but the bug hasn t yet hit the windshield other governments and central banks have noticed too here s what they observe japan has spent decades with zero or negative rates engaged in massive qe and boondoggle spending gone in and out of recession and somehow stayed on its feet an economic boom it is not but the country avoided the worst nightmares that s a win in the way central bankers think meanwhile mario draghi s european central bank tried a similar strategy to the extent it could given that the eurozone lacks a unified fiscal authority it seemed to be working well enough that the ecb decided last year to end some of the extraordinary measures but simply talking about it appears to have put the eurozone economy into a mild flu so now they are back on a japan like course italy alone has so much debt it could easily become another greece but far larger and more difficult for the rest of europe to rescue italy is already in recession albeit a mild one so far but its debt load is still rising at some point it becomes a systemic risk to the eurozone and eu and the us as i ve said the fed waited too long to start exiting from crisis era measures they gave the economy time to go from dependence on easy money to outright addiction and as we all know addictions are very very hard to break so now the fed has cold feet too further tightening appears unlikely they will try to cut rates as the weakness grows more obvious but it won t help and they will start digging through the toolbox for something else to try whatever they do will probably surprise and alarm us it will not have the desired effects at least not as fast as they want but it also won t kill us if we prepare for it the dominoes are starting to drop as expected to review the entire world is up to its ears in debt thanks to a decade of central bank action we are late in a growth cycle that is going to end possibly soon whenever it does us government borrowing needs will skyrocket higher from already astronomical levels the federal reserve will end up monetizing this new debt working off that debt will take years possibly decades hence the long slow japanization i ve described i don t think we will endure it for 30 years like japan has we will instead force a worldwide default which i ve dubbed the great reset beyond that lie better times but we ll go through hell first washington dc dallas and puerto rico next week i fly up to washington dc to record a video with my good friend neil howe i m sure i will find a few other friends to meet with before i turn around and come back to puerto rico towards the middle of may i will head to dallas for the strategic investment conference almost every day i have a session with some of the conference speakers and panelists coordinating what they will say and making sure that we stay on theme i am really pumped and almost can t wait while the conference is sold out a few spots may open up on the waiting list if you want to be there if not the virtual pass is the next best thing on wednesday i met with a group of very sharp investment advisors hosted by brian lockhart of peak capital management we talked portfolio construction and strategy the conversation reminded me that i need to do a letter or two on that topic plus a new indexing methodology that i suspect is going to take the world by storm there are so many things happening in the investment world as opposed to the macroeconomic world that really should be explored finally i had dinner with lyric hughes hale and some of our friends she invited a young man in from silicon valley who literally watches over 5 000 ethereum developers working to use that blockchain technology to change the world i am a big intellectual fan of ethereum lyric who is writing a book on china and one of the smartest economists i know made the boldest prediction of the night she thinks trump will outlast xi jinping in office she regaled us with stories of what s happening on the ground in china and if true there really is trouble in river city it made for a fun evening have yourself a good day and get together with some friends shane and i get to go meet some neighbors this evening here in dorado who have as their guest liz ann sonders chief investment strategist for schwab who will kick off my conference on monday may 13 i see more interesting conversations ahead you have a great week your thinking about

financial markets tend to undergo manic depressive cycles and this has been especially true in recent years during risk ons investors driven by animal spirits produce bull markets frothiness and sometimes outright bubbles eventually however they overreact to some negative shock by becoming too pessimistic shedding risk and forcing a correction or bear market whereas prices of us and global equities rose sharply throughout 2017 markets began to wobble in 2018 and became fully depressed in the last quarter of the year this risk off reflected concerns about a global recession sino american trade tensions and the federal reserve s signals that it would continue to raise interest rates and pursue quantitative tightening but since january 2019 markets have rallied so much so that some senior asset managers now foresee a market melt up the opposite of a meltdown with equities continuing to rise sharply above their current elevated levels one could argue that this latest risk on cycle will continue for the rest of 2019 for starters growth is stabilising in china owing to another round of macroeconomic stimulus there easing fears of a hard landing and the us and china may soon reach a deal to prevent the ongoing trade war from escalating further at the same time us and global growth are expected to strengthen somewhat in the second half of 2019 and the disruption of a hard brexit has been averted with the european union extending the deadline for the united kingdom s departure to october 31 2019 as for the eurozone s prospects much will depend on germany where growth could rebound as global headwinds fade moreover central banks particularly the fed have become super dovish again and this appears to have reversed the tightening of financial conditions that produced the risk off in late 2018 and on the political front the chances of impeachment proceedings in the us have fallen sharply with the release of the mueller report which clears us president donald trump of criminal conspiracy charges though it is not conclusive on the question of obstruction of justice now that the russia investigation is over trump may avoid issuing destabilising statements or tweets that could rattle the stock market given that it is a key benchmark by which he judges his own success finally in a positive feedback loop stronger markets boost economic growth which in turn can lead to even higher market values these developments may or may not ensure clear sailing for the rest of 2019 while markets have already priced in the aforementioned positive potentialities other factors could trigger another risk off episode first the price to earnings ratio is high in many markets particularly for us equities which means that even a modest negative shock could trigger a correction in fact us corporate profit margins are so high that there could be an earnings recession in 2019 if growth remains around 2 while production costs may increase with a tight labour market second there are heightened risks associated with the scale and composition of us corporate sector debt owing to the prevalence of leveraged loans high yield junk bonds and fallen angel firms whose bonds have been downgraded from investment grade to near junk status moreover the commercial real estate sector is burdened with overcapacity as developers overbuilt and e commerce sales have undercut demand for brick and mortar retail space against this backdrop any sign of a growth slowdown could lead to a sudden increase in the cost of capital for highly leveraged firms not just in the us but also in emerging markets where a significant share of debt is denominated in dollars third assuming that us economic growth holds up market expectations of more fed dovishness will likely prove unfounded thus a fed decision not to cut rates could come as a surprise triggering an equity correction fourth hopes of a resolution to the sino american trade war may also be misplaced even with a deal the conflict could escalate again if either side suspects the other of not holding up its end and other simmering trade tensions could boil over if for example the us congress fails to ratify the trump administration s revised north american free trade agreement or if trump follows through with import tariffs on cars from europe fifth european growth is very fragile and could be hindered by any of a number of developments from a strong showing by populist parties in the upcoming european parliament elections to a political or economic crisis in italy this would come at a time when monetary and fiscal stimulus in the eurozone is constrained and eurozone integration is stalled sixth many emerging market economies are also heavily exposed to political and policy risks these include from least to most fragile mexico brazil argentina turkey iran and venezuela and china s latest round of stimulus has saddled its already indebted corporate sector with even more financial risk and may not even suffice in lifting its growth rate seventh trump may react to the mueller report with bluster not prudence with an eye to the 2020 presidential election he could double down on his fights with the democrats launch new salvos in the trade war stack the fed board with unqualified cronies bully the fed to cut rates or precipitate another government shutdown over the debt ceiling or immigration policy at the same time the trump administration s approach to iran and venezuela could put further upward pressure on oil prices which have rallied since september 2018 to the detriment of growth finally we are still in a world of low potential growth a new mediocre sustained by high private and public debt rising inequality and heightened geopolitical risk the widespread populist backlash against globalisation trade migration and technology will all but certainly have an eventual negative impact on growth and markets so while investors latest love affair with equity markets may continue in 2019 it will remain a fickle and volatile relationship any number of disappointments could trigger another risk off and possibly a sharp market correction the question is not whether it will happen but when dm
imf program pakistan deserves to be cut some slack journalismpakistan com april 29 2019 asif ali qureshi cfa as a financial analyst by profession associated with pakistan s financial sector for the past 23 years and engaged in the study and analysis of the country s economy capital markets and key sectors i feel compelled to share my views albeit unsolicited on the ongoing talks between pakistan and imf for another bailout package as the second imf mission in six months arrives in pakistan under my professional and personal interests i have closely tracked the past four imf programs to pakistan 2000 2001 2008 and 2013 and over the past two decades i have had occasional interactions with the imf s resident representatives in pakistan except for the current one pakistan has been one of the prolonged users of imf resources for the past 30 years however unlike the 1990s when almost all of the imf programs to pakistan stalled in early stages three out of the four imf programs to pakistan since 2000 were fully completed 2008 sba being the only exception the 2001 prgf program did not achieve 100 disbursement as pakistan voluntarily chose to forgo the final two tranches due to a marked improvement in the country s balance of payments position with a relatively high rate of completion of the imf programs since 2000 75 of all programs and 82 4 in terms of loan value and less than three years since the successful completion of the last imf program in 2016 one wonders why pakistan seems left with no choice but to seek another bailout package from the imf if a patient suffers a relapse soon after remission then it would be reasonable to question the authenticity of a clean bill of health given in the first place likewise prolonged treatment for a curable disease casts doubts about the efficacy of the medication although the patient s transgressions may also be a contributing factor in pakistan s case all of the above seem to have been at play arguably politics plays a definitive role in the imf programs both at the lender and borrower levels the program s approval design and implementation are ostensibly influenced by the borrower country s relationship with the major shareholders of the imf on the other hand the success of the program implementation is dependent on the political objectives of the ruling regime in the borrower country the imf lending programs are structured solutions based on the policy prescriptions of the washington consensus however with globalization and technological changes many of the well established economic theories and ideas are being globally challenged especially since the post 2008 global financial crisis moreover economics itself is a peculiar discipline in the words of paul samuelson economics is not an exact science it s a combination of an art and elements of science and that s almost the first and last lesson to be learned about economics that in my judgment we are not converging toward exactitude but we re improving our data bases and our ways of reasoning about them imf programs in pakistan have had their share of pitfalls i vividly remember the havoc brought about by the nda targets set by the imf under the 2000 sba the overnight interest rate shot past 100 on 31 december 2000 as sbp tried to meet the near impossible quarterly nda target it met the goal through what the imf described as unorthodox steps the imf later relaxed the nda targets for the subsequent quarters but without publically acknowledging the targets it earlier set were unrealistic if not impossible economic forecasts are rarely accurate as a case in point the following table provides a comparison of imf s forecasts for pakistan s current account balance in its various country reports during the 2008 sba and the actual numbers pakistan current account balance imf projections vs actual usd million 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 imf projections dec 08 10 622 9 738 8 520 7 952 7 853

country reports sbp perhaps it is time for some introspection by the imf about the limitations of its econometric models and the program frameworks to align them with the changing global macroeconomic dynamics and thinking and to make them more customized to the specific circumstances of each recipient country based on the media reports that followed the last imf mission six months ago it seemed that the imf wanted to use the egyptian template for pakistan the three year eff program granted to egypt in november 2016 saw the egp usd nearly double overnight consequently the headline inflation surged to 33 in july 2017 prompting the egyptian central bank to raise the policy rate to 19 25 egypt quarterly current account balance usd million sep 16 dec 16 mar 17 jun 17 sep 17 dec 17 mar 18 jun

driven by travel tourism and workers remittances while the trade deficit has remained largely unchanged moreover foreign portfolio inflows primarily into the high yielding t bills were the major contributor behind the increase in the country s fx reserves in the case of pakistan the current pti led government inherited an economic mess of monumental proportions with massive twin deficits and high public sector indebtedness this had resulted from a combination of an overvalued exchange rate profligate fiscal spending massive energy subsidies and enormous pse losses moreover the country s institutional capacity bureaucracy agencies regulators pses etc has deteriorated sharply over the past ten years which itself has become a major structural impediment to its credit the government has taken some politically tricky decisions including an increase in gas and electricity prices higher petroleum taxes and massive cuts in the development expenditure concurrently the sbp has let the pkr usd slide to 141 at present from 105 in december 2017 while hiking the interest rates by 500bp since january 2018 to 11 25 at present these policy actions have started to yield results as reflected in the significant reduction in the monthly run rate of the current account deficit from an average of over usd1 5 billion in fy2018 to around usd0 6 billion in the past two months moreover the economy is undergoing a sharp slowdown as manifested in lsm contraction and declining sales for cement automobiles petroleum products and electricity likewise the property markets have cooled off sharply and the retail sales are struggling to hold up just as starvation is not a way to reduce obesity the hefty upfront macroeconomic adjustments should not be the approach for addressing the deep rooted structural issues pakistan s current gdp capita is about 1 3rd of what egypt s gdp capita was in 2016 when it entered the imf program the social cost of a sharp further macroeconomic adjustment would be much higher for pakistan than it was for egypt also the latter has benefited from a sharp pickup in inbound foreign tourism and a rise in gas production pakistan on the other hand could be trapped in a low growth cycle for much longer the two significant structural challenges confronting pakistan are a large fiscal imbalance and a weak institutional capacity and none of the two has any quick fixes the fiscal predicament is a multidimensional problem involving a narrow resource base a dysfunctional federal revenue authority vertical asymmetry of resource expenditure distribution between the federal government and provinces huge subsidies and massive pse losses the energy sector is the biggest drag on the federal budget despite eating up hundreds of billions in tariff subsidies the aggregate loss of the power sector distribution companies discos exceeded pkr 250 billion in 2018 likewise the annual losses of other ailing pses like pia and steel mills are running into tens of billions for its size a profitable power sector would be making substantial contributions to the government s revenues in shape of taxes and dividends similarly the government would be receiving much higher revenues from the profitable energy companies ogdc ppl ghpl etc if their cash flow constraints due to the inter corporate circular debt were removed the real fiscal cost of loss making pses is not limited to the subsidies but also includes the lost revenues that these pses should be providing to the government reforms of the energy sector and other pses alone can have a positive net fiscal benefit of 2 3 of gdp the next imf program should provide a medium term glide path to a sustainable macroeconomic recovery rather than calling for drastic frontloaded adjustments the broad contours of the program should include realistic quantitative targets both for the sbp nda nfa govt borrowing from sbp and for the government fbr revenues fiscal deficit it should be noted that the levy of banking transaction tax on non filers in 2015 and the recent crackdown against fake benami bank accounts have led to a sharp increase in the currency in circulation cic the cic m2 ratio that averaged around 22 before 2015 has risen to over 28 at present this has led to a decline in the money multiplier m2 m0 ratio due to rapid m0 expansion and should be appropriately accounted for while setting the sbp s nda and the government borrowing targets fiscal adjustment should be the main thrust of the program with a focus on reforming the revenue collection machinery preferably a new unified agency for collection of all federal and provincial taxes and a more balanced revenue expenditure distribution between the federal government and the provinces realistic tax collection targets should be set with a focus on broadening the tax base rather than increasing the tax incidence on the existing taxpayers energy sector reforms should focus on the removal of the price anomalies in natural gas and electricity tariffs to achieve full cost recovery within 12 months stringent energy efficiency standards should be introduced and all old and inefficient power generating units both in the public and private sectors should be shut down an aggressive privatization program should be launched for divestments of 26 shareholding with management control in pses including pia steel mills discos and other power generation companies monetary policy has been tightened quite aggressively since mid 2018 it had to pick up the slack as the fiscal policy remained highly expansionary however the burden of further macroeconomic adjustment should fall predominantly on the fiscal policy in the shape of revenue measures and cut in subsidies with high domestic public debt gdp and a sharp increase in debt servicing costs further increases in interest rates would run counter to the objectives of fiscal consolidation a managed float regime anchored around a target reer range should be adopted as the exchange rate policy instead of a freely floating exchange rate regime the debt policy coordination office should be strengthened with greater autonomy and increased capacity there seems to be a misplaced focus on extending the maturity profile of the domestic public debt the following factors should be taken into account in this regard o the rollover risk of the domestic public debt is minimal as pakistan s capital account is non convertible which keeps the domestic banking liquidity trapped in the system o repricing risk is presently on the downside as the current interest rate levels are closer to the historical peaks o about 38 of the total domestic public debt as of february 2019 was held by sbp which can only be short term in nature o there is an urgent need for reforms in the national savings schemes nss so that all major long term investments flow through the pib market the rollover risk is more pertinent to external debt an active program for external fiscal financing should be put in place to target a more balanced domestic external public debt mix as the current domestic public debt gdp of 49 feb 19 is about 2x of the external public debt gdp

the move comes on the back of a freeze in the prices of basic goods and public services announced by president mauricio macri two weeks ago however macri s popularity has been falling in opinion polls as his austerity measures backed by the international monetary fund imf have proved highly unpopular previously argentina had set maximum and minimum exchange rate levels for the peso against the us dollar in which the currency could fluctuate freely advertisement the central bank would only intervene by buying or selling dollars if the peso dropped below 51 54 or rose above 39 75 to the dollar coming at the end of a week in which the peso lost 8 16 percent against the dollar the markets reacted well to the news with the peso opening at 46 50 compared to its closing price on friday of 46 80 and had reached 45 81 by lunchtime we support these measures which are sufficiently calibrated to the challenges facing argentina said the imf which last year agreed to lend argentina 56 billion to help the south american country battle its currency crisis and inflation issues to combat last week s currency volatility the central bank rose its reference interest rate to 72 percent macri s government says currency instability is the main factor in the country s spiraling inflation which reached 11 8 percent for the first quarter of 2019 with the figure for the last 12 month just under 55 percent advertisement economist matias carugati told afp that the new measure could work but that there are no guarantees the central bank will allow the exchange rate to move as freely as possible but while trying to reduce volatility he added argentina s economic crisis and rising prices are two of the major concerns for citizens ahead of october s elections
this article is more than 4 years old associated press remember when nobel laureate economist paul krugman made the call two and a half years ago now that global stock markets would collapse because of newly elected president trump the political novice and general societal delinquent would trigger a recession krugman wrote in the new york times the only thing triggered was krugman himself and countless others who have been predicting the apocolypse since november 2016 about that 2020 recession people it s not happening here s why the earnings season is coming in healthier than people expected three weeks ago most companies earnings are coming in better than we thought says scott clemons chief investment strategist for brown brothers harriman in new york we see no earnings recession coming at us the highs in the s p are similar to where we were in october the economy is a bit better interest rates are lower and the likelihood of a very aggressive fed is remote all of that is supportive of growth no recession next year associated press as everyone now knows the u s economy grew 3 2 in the first quarter beating the consensus forecast when the economy was growing at similar numbers in trump s first quarters in office guys like krugman explained it all away as merely a by product of the obama administration the obama presidency must still be serving us leftovers growth came thanks to tax cuts followed by regulatory rollback which helped some industries another factor economists are considering is all the deleveraging of household balance sheets that began in earnest in the obama years americans were paying off debt instead of spending much of that delveraging was due to the housing bubble popping in 2008 household debt of equivalent income was over 144 10 years ago and is now at 99 according to federal reserve data that s about 6 trillion that has gone towards deleveraging rather than spending and driving the economy clemons says in other words it s not just the fed we need to help the economy growth we are paying back bills and that s led to lower growth in the past it restores health to the american household balance sheet but you get little in the way of spending so a penny saved is not a penny going to corporate earnings let s say deleveraging has led to a relatively stable if not unimpressive 1 2 annualized consumer growth rate even without americans shopping with reckless abandon the stock market made a new high for the year last week and while the s p 500 is a poor indicator of the true economic sentiment on main street wall street s confidence is telling it tells us that big investors believe the fed s dovish tilt means no rate hikes this year three to four hikes were expected back in january the cme fedwatch tool is giving a 50 probability of a rate cut at the october 2019 fed meeting prudent investors won t count on that especially if china is still in stimulus mode and u s wages hold steady or push higher the imf increased its forecast for china s gdp two weeks ago to 6 3 from 6 2 2019 bloomberg finance lp march industrial profits in china increased 13 9 year over year to around 87 billion according to the national bureau of statistics in beijing too much good news could lead to less stimulus still none of this looks like a recession of course it can be argued that the u s and china are in a late stage economic cycle and need help this summer will mark the tenth year of expansion for the u s economy if this continues next year trump and the fed would have helped the u s beat an economic record without the fed s pause it would have been impossible for markets to rally on from a weakened fourth quarter says vlad signorelli head of macroeconomic research firm bretton woods research in long valley new jersey gdp would have weakened the fed s decision to put rake hikes on hold allowed the republican tax cuts to work into an economy no longer threatened by a more contractionary rate policy today rate hike probabilities going into january 2020 are at zero investors expect gdp to remain around 2 5 on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year that s good for wages which the fed is no longer hell bent on reducing labor markets that showed signs of weakening in the fourth quarter have recovered the economy ended the first quarter at a 3 8 unemployment rate in february annual wage growth for hourly workers increased by 3 4 the fastest rate since early 2009 unemployment under 4 is good for trump s rhetoric of putting women minorities and job thirsty working class americans to work all of that improves his odds of reelection in 2020 despite generally weak approval numbers the global economy an economy that was supposed to fall off a cliff following the imposition of tariffs on china seems to be in good working order not only is there no recession in sight here at home but there is no recession on the horizon in china either monthly chinese pmi data gets updated on tuesday investors will be looking for confirmation of the stabilization thesis in china which will have ramifications for asia the world s largest consumer market the recession call is dead for 2020 however last week s gdp data did have something for everyone it was sort of like the mueller report on trump s beloved economy you see what you want to see the bears can feast on the fact that net exports contributed 103 basis points to the headline gdp number of 3 2 inventories contributed 67 basis points and government spending another 41 basis points so about half of the growth came from trade and washington d c 2015 bloomberg finance lp these contributions in various ways are one offs reflecting inventory building to beat u s china tariffs distortions to trade data from the impact of the u s china trade dispute and government spending reflected the distortions from the federal government shutdown says neil mackinnon an economist with vtb capital in london strip out these factors and u s real gdp growth was about 1 he says discounting for quarterly inflation global investors should pay careful attention to what central banks are doing in other countries if they follow the fed s lead in acknowledging that there is no need to rush out ahead of inflation by raising interest rates then capital costs will fall in emerging markets that s generally growth inducive and throws yet another monkey wrench into that clunky old recession machine

national economic council chairman larry kudlow appears on fox business to discuss the latest strong economic numbers including gdp growth rising wages low inflation and strong capital investment additionally kudlow discusses current status of u s trade negotiations with china and a looming battle against the decpeticons for usmca chuck grassley the constitution assigns congress the task of regulating foreign commerce the house and senate must pass legislation implementing usmca as chairman of the finance committee i m leading the senate effort i ve been involved in the passage of every u s free trade agreement and it s never easy reorganizing a massive economic relationship affects many constituencies and that s inevitably complicated i ve met with congressional colleagues as well as u s canadian and mexican trade officials to discuss how our nations will secure legislative approval of usmca a significant roadblock is the administration s tariffs on steel and aluminum and retaliatory canadian and mexican tariffs on u s products these levies are a tax on americans and they jeopardize usmca s prospects of passage in the mexican congress canadian parliament and u s congress canadian and mexican trade officials may be more delicate in their language but they re diplomats i m not if these tariffs aren t lifted usmca is dead there is no appetite in congress to debate usmca with these tariffs in place many americans have been harmed by retaliatory tariffs mexican tariffs on u s pork to take one example have lowered the value of live hogs by 12 an animal iowa is the top pork producing state in the country that means jobs wages and communities are hurt every day these tariffs continue as i hear directly from iowans it s time for the tariffs to go more on the latest op ed by iowa decepticon senator chuck grassley as i mentioned last week the grassley johnson letter to ag bill barr is exhibit a in how dc attempts to leverage their own financial interests against the outsider that is donald trump senate finance chairman grassley s move last week was a shot across the bow but generally only noticed by those who travel the deep weeds of corrupt dc leverage strategy essentially grassley saying he won t allow trump to expose the deep state corruption unless trump concedes to wall street s demands on trade deals it only took a few days for the evidence of this leverage move to surface as grassley acting on behalf of his k street donors writes an op ed stating if trump doesn t drop the steel and aluminum tariffs then he can consider the usmca dead an absolutely typical decepticon move the op ed itself is a clear example of pure globalist trade bs for many reasons forgive me if my language turns curt but cth has been battling this exact issue for a long time hogwash the 1 contract owner of pork is smithfield now a chinese company the price of pork is more related to the ongoing u s china trade negotiation than any mexican reciprocal tariff additionally the usmca terms were negotiated with mexico agreeing to them as constructed grassley is being intentionally obtuse it s not mexico taking exception to the steel and aluminum tariffs it is the u s specifically the u s chamber of commerce ie wall street sure mexico and canada would love to keep their access to the u s market as open as possible and water down any position that increases the u s economy however it is congress who are currently positioning themselves to eliminate the u s benefit not mexico and canada these decepticons are doing the bidding of the multinationals that control wall street and attempting to keep their place at the k street donor trough iowa senator grassley is 100 owned by bigag and president trump has already given grassley a big win with the continuance of a ridiculous ethanol subsidy now grassley wants more on behalf of his benefactors this is what we are up against purchased politicians doing the bidding of multinational corporate interests and simultaneously trying to hide their motives these are the worst of the decepticons this is why they can never be trusted it must be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to plan more doubtful of success nor more dangerous to manage than a new system for the initiator has the enmity of all who would profit by the preservation of the old institution and merely lukewarm defenders in those who gain by the new ones niccolò machiavelli potus trump is disrupting the global order of things in order to protect and preserve the shrinking interests of the u s he is fighting almost single handed at the threshold of the abyss our interests our position is zero sum our opposition seeks to repel and retain the status quo they were on the cusp of full economic victory over the u s reuters article link summary of action president trump structuring a plan to break up multinational big ag and their controlled markets stop in the interim to return to supply side principles potus trump proposes a bridge subsidy approach to wean farmers off exploitative globalist multinational contract farming stop in this endeavor president trump and mexican president lopez obrador will be brothers in arms fullstop president trump is disrupting decades of multinational financial interests who use the u s as a host for their ideological endeavors president trump is confronting multinational corporations and the global constructs of economic systems that were put in place to the detriment of the host usa ie you or in this example the u s farmer there are trillions at stake it is all about the economics all else is chaff and countermeasures familiar faces perhaps faces you previously thought were decent are now revealing their alignment with larger entities that are our abusers in an effort to awaken the victim to the cycle of self destructive codependent behavior allow me to cue a recent audio visual example from u s senator john thune watch start with the so called big six monsanto syngenta dow agrosciences dupont bayer and basf produce roughly three quarters of the pesticides used in the world the first five also sell more than half the name brand seeds that farmers plant including varieties modified for resistance to the very pesticides they also sell meanwhile if farmers want fertilizer a list of 10 other companies starting with potashcorp account for about two thirds of the world market once the plowing planting nurturing and harvesting are done around 80 percent of major crops pass through the hands of four traders adm bunge cargill and louis dreyfus these companies aren t just financiers of course cargill for example produces animal feed and many other products and it supplies more than a fifth of all meat sold in the united states and if you ever had any ideas about going vegetarian to avoid the conglomerates forget about it adm processes about a third of all soybeans in the united states and a sixth of those grown around the globe it also brews more than 5 6 billion liters of ethanol for gasoline and pours more than 2 million metric tons of high fructose corn syrup every year and it produces a sixth of the world s chocolate continue and go deep what south dakota senator john thune is showcasing here is his full alignment with big multinational corporate agriculture big ag big ag is not supporting local farmers big ag does not support free and fair markets big ag supports the interests of multinational corporations and multinational financial interests for those interests the u s is the host from our perspective they are the parasite it is critical to think of big ag in the same way we already are familiar with multinational manufacturing of durable goods we are already familiar how china mexico and asean nations export our raw materials ore coking coal rare earth minerals etc the raw materials are used to manufacture goods overseas the cheap durable goods are then shipped back into the u s for purchase it is within this decades long process where we lost the manufacturing base and the multinational economic planners world trade organization put us on a path to being a service driven economy the road to a service driven economy is paved with a great disparity between financial classes the wealth gap is directly related to the inability of the middle class to thrive elite financial interests including those within washington dc gain wealth and power the u s workforce is reduced to servitude service of their affluent needs the destruction of the u s industrial and manufacturing base is exactly why the wealth gap has exploded in the past 30 years with that familiarity did you think the multinationals would stop with only durable goods they don t they didn t the exact same exfiltration and exploitation has been happening with increased speed over the past 15 20 years with consumable goods ie food raw material foodstuff is exported to china asean nations and mexico processed and shipped back into the u s as a finished product recent example salmonella ritz bits whey nabisco shuts new jersey manufacturing plant moves food production to mexico the result this is the same design flow with food as previously exploited by other economic sectors including auto manufacturing archer daniels midland adm monsanto nestlé pepsico bunge potash corp cargill or wilmar stay out of the public eye by design most megafood conglomerates have roots going back a century or more but ever increasing consolidation means that their current corporate owners may have been established only a few years ago welcome to the complex world of big ag multinational corporations big ag are now invested in controlling the outputs of u s agricultural industry and farmers this process is why food prices have risen exponentially in the past decade the free market is not determining price there is no supply and demand influence within this modern agricultural dynamic food commodities are now a controlled market just like durable goods the raw material harvests writ large are exploited by the financial interests of massive multinational corporations this is contract farming again if we were to pull out of nafta our food bill would drop 25 or more within the first year further if u s supply and demand were part of the domestic market price for food we would see the prices of aggregate food products drop by half almost immediately some perishable food products would predictably drop so dramatically in price it is unfathomable how far the prices would fall behind this dynamic we find the international corporate and financial interests who are inherently at risk from president trump s america first economic and trade platform believe it or not president trump is up against an entire world economic establishment when we understand how trade works in the modern era we understand why the agents within the system are so adamantly opposed to u s president trump the biggest lie in modern economics willingly spread and maintained by corporate media is that a system of global markets still exists it doesn t every element of global economic trade is controlled and exploited by massive institutions multinational banks and multinational corporations institutions like the world trade organization wto and world bank control trillions of dollars in economic activity underneath that economic activity there are people who hold the reigns of power over the outcomes these individuals and groups are the stakeholders in direct opposition to principles of america first national economics the modern financial constructs of these entities have been established over the course of the past three decades when you understand how they manipulate the economic system of individual nations you begin to understand understand why they are so fundamentally opposed to president trump in the western world separate from communist control perspectives ie china global markets are a modern myth nothing more than a talking point meant to keep people satiated with sound bites they might find familiar global markets have been destroyed over the past three decades by multinational corporations who control the products formerly contained within global markets the same is true for commodities markets the multinational trade and economic system run by corporations and multinational banks now controls the product outputs of independent nations the free market economic system has been usurped by entities who create what is best described as controlled markets u s president trump smartly understands what has taken place additionally he uses economic leverage as part of a broader national security policy and to understand who opposes president trump specifically because of the economic leverage he creates it becomes important to understand the objectives of the global and financial elite who run and operate the institutions the big club understanding how trillions of trade dollars influence geopolitical policy we begin to understand the three decade global financial construct they seek to protect that is global financial exploitation of national markets four basic elements multinational corporations purchase controlling interests in various national outputs harvests an raw materials and ancillary industries of developed industrial western nations example the multinational corporations making the purchases are underwritten by massive global financial institutions multinational banks note in china it is the communist government underwriting the purchase the multinational banks and the multinational corporations then utilize lobbying interests to manipulate the internal political policy of the targeted nation state s with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint against the backdrop of president trump confronting china and against the backdrop of nafta being renegotiated likely to exit and against the necessary need to support the key u s steel industry revisiting the economic influences within the modern import export dynamic will help conceptualize the issues at the heart of the matter there are a myriad of interests within each trade sector that make specific explanation very challenging however here s the basic outline for three decades economic globalism has advanced quickly everyone accepts this statement yet few actually stop to ask who and what are behind this and why influential people with vested financial interests in the process have sold a narrative that global manufacturing global sourcing and global production was the inherent way of the future the same voices claimed the american economy was consigned to become a service driven economy what was always missed in these discussions is that advocates selling this global economy message have a vested financial and ideological interest in convincing the information consumer it is all just a natural outcome of economic progress it s not it s not natural at all it is a process that is entirely controlled promoted and utilized by large conglomerates lobbyists purchased politicians and massive financial corporations again i ll try to retain the larger altitude perspective without falling into the traps of the esoteric weeds i freely admit this is tough to explain and i may not be successful bulletpoint 1 multinational corporations purchase controlling interests in various national elements of developed industrial western nations this is perhaps the most challenging to understand in essence thanks specifically to the way the world trade organization wto was established in 1995 national companies expanded their influence into multiple nations across a myriad of industries and economic sectors energy agriculture raw earth minerals etc this is the basic underpinning of national companies becoming multinational corporations think of these multinational corporations as global entities now powerful enough to reach into multiple nations simultaneously and purchase controlling interests in a single economic commodity a historic reference point might be the original multinational enterprise energy via oil production exxon mobil bp etc however in the modern global world it s not just oil the resource and product procurement extends to virtually every possible commodity and industry from the very visible wheat corn to the obscure small minerals and even flowers bulletpoint 2 the multinational corporations making the purchases are underwritten by massive global financial institutions multinational banks during the past several decades national companies merged the largest lemon producer company in brazil merges with the largest lemon company in mexico merges with the largest lemon company in argentina merges with the largest lemon company in the u s etc etc national companies formerly of one nation become continental companies with control over an entire continent of nations or it could be over several continents or even the entire world market of lemon widget production these are now multinational corporations they hold interests in specific segments this example lemons across a broad variety of individual nations national laws on monopoly building are not the same in all nations most are not as structured as the u s a or other more developed nations with more laws during the acquisition phase when encountering a highly developed nation with monopoly laws the process of an umbrella corporation might be needed to purchase the targeted interests within a specific nation the example of monsanto applies here bulletpoint 3 the multinational banks and the multinational corporations then utilize lobbying interests to manipulate the internal political policy of the targeted nation state s with control of the majority of actual lemons the multinational corporation now holds a different set of financial values than a local farmer or national market this is why commodities exchanges are essentially dead in the aggregate the mercantile exchange is no longer a free or supply based market it is now a controlled market exploited by mega sized multinational corporations instead of the traditional supply demand equation determining prices the corporations look to see what nations can afford what prices the supply of the controlled product is then distributed to the country according to their ability to afford the price this is essentially the bastardized and politicized function of the world trade organization wto this is also how the corporations controlling wto policy maximize profits back to the lemons a corporation might hold the rights to the majority of the lemon production in brazil argentina and california florida the price the u s consumer pays for the lemons is directed by the amount of inventory distribution the controlling corporation allows in the u s if the u s lemon harvest is abundant the controlling interests will export the product to keep the u s consumer spending at peak or optimal price a u s customer might pay 2 for a lemon a mexican customer might pay 50 and a canadian 1 25 the bottom line issue is the national supply in this example harvest yield is not driving the national price because the supply is now controlled by massive multinational corporations the mistake people often make is calling this a global commodity process in the modern era this global commodity phrase is particularly nonsense a true global commodity is a process of individual nations harvesting creating a similar product and bringing that product to a global market individual nations each independently engaged in creating a similar product under modern globalism this process no longer takes place it s a complete fraud massive multinational corporations control the majority of production inside each nation and therefore control the global product market and price it is a controlled system example part of the lobbying in the food industry is to advocate for the expansion of u s taxpayer benefits to underwrite the costs of the domestic food products they control by lobbying dc these multinational corporations get congress and policy makers to expand the basis of who can use ebt and snap benefits state reimbursement rates expanding the federal subsidy for food purchases is part of the corporate profit dynamic with increased taxpayer subsidies the food price controllers can charge more domestically and export more of the product internationally taxes via subsidies go into their profit margins the corporations then use a portion of those enhanced profits in contributions to the politicians it s a circle of money in highly developed nations this multinational corporate process requires the corporation to purchase the domestic political process as above with individual nations allowing the exploitation in varying degrees as such the corporate lobbyists pay hundreds of millions to politicians for changes in policies and regulations one sector one product or one industry at a time these are specialized lobbyists example the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius cfius is an inter agency committee authorized to review transactions that could result in control of a u s business by a foreign person covered transactions in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the united states cfius operates pursuant to section 721 of the defense production act of 1950 as amended by the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 finsa section 721 and as implemented by executive order 11858 as amended and regulations at 31 c f r part 800 the cfius process has been the subject of significant reforms over the past several years these include numerous improvements in internal cfius procedures enactment of finsa in july 2007 amendment of executive order 11858 in january 2008 revision of the cfius regulations in november 2008 and publication of guidance on cfius s national security considerations in december 2008 more bulletpoint 4 with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint the process of charging the u s consumer more for a product that under normal national market conditions would cost less is a process called exfiltration of wealth this is the basic premise the cornerstone behind the catch phrase globalism it is never discussed to control the market price some contracted product may even be secured and shipped with the intent to allow it to sit idle or rot it s all about controlling the price and maximizing the profit equation to gain the same 1 profit a widget multinational might have to sell 20 widgets in el salvador 25 each or two widgets in the u s 2 50 each think of the process like the historic reference of opec oil producing economic countries only in the modern era massive corporations are playing the role of opec and it s not oil being controlled thanks to the wto it s almost everything again this is highlighted in the example of taxpayers subsidizing the food sector ebt snap etc the corporations can charge u s consumers more ex more beef is exported red meat prices remain high at the grocery store but subsidized u s consumers can better afford the high prices of course if you are not receiving food payment assistance middle class you can t eat the steaks because you can t afford them not accidentally it s the same scheme in the obamacare healthcare system agriculturally multinational corporate monsanto says all your harvests are belong to us contract with us or you lose because we can control the market price of your end product downside is that once you sign that contract you agree to terms that are entirely created by the financial interests of the larger corporation not your farm the multinational agriculture lobby is massive we willingly feed the world as part of the system but you as a grocery customer pay more per unit at the grocery store because domestic supply no longer determines domestic price within the agriculture community the feed the world production export factor also drives the need for labor labor is a cost the multinational corps have a vested interest in low labor costs ergo open border policies ie willingly purchased republicans not supporting border wall etc this corrupt economic manipulation exploitation applies over multiple sectors and even in the sub sector of an industry like steel china india purchases the raw material coking coal then sells the finished good rolled steel back to the global market at a discount or it could be rubber or concrete or plastic or frozen chicken parts etc the america first trump trade doctrine upsets the entire construct of this multinational export control dynamic team trump focus exclusively on bilateral trade deals with specific trade agreements targeted toward individual nations not national corporations america first is also specific policy at a granular product level looking out for the national interests of the united states u s workers u s companies and u s consumers under president trump s trade positions balanced and fair trade with strong regulatory control over national assets exfiltration of u s national wealth is essentially stopped this puts many current multinational corporations globalists who previously took a stake hold in the u s economy with intention to export the wealth in a position of holding contracted interest of an asset they can no longer exploit perhaps now we understand better how massive multi billion multinational corporations and institutions are aligned against president trump countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate this should have taken place many years ago but as the saying goes better late than never donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 24 2018 tariffs are the greatest either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with

significant moves ahead of the announcement of the federal reserve s latest monetary policy decision on wednesday the fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged although the accompanying statement and fed chairman jerome powell s subsequent press conference are still likely to attract attention traders are also likely to keep a close eye on the labor department s monthly jobs report

product jumped by 3 2 percent in the first quarter after climbing by 2 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 the acceleration in the pace of growth came as a surprise to economists who had expected gdp to increase by 2 1 percent paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics said the much stronger than expected gdp growth would seem to make a mockery of claims that the u s economy is slowing as the fiscal stimulus fades after all 3 2 is well above the economy s 2 potential pace and the 2 2 gain in the final quarter of last year ashworth said looking beyond the headline number however there are plenty of causes for concern ashworth predicted positive contributions from net trade inventories and highways investment will all be reversed in the coming quarters and continues to

have been extracted without material adjustment from the annual report the basis of presentation of the financial information set out below is detailed in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements below highlights overview second year of operational recovery with record crop production in 2018 and further increase expected in 2019 improved operational performance not reflected in financial results due to material decline in the cpo price during 2018 sale of 95 per cent interest in pbj to klk group completed financial revenue up 5 3 per cent to 105 5 million 2017 100 2 million as reduced cpo and cpko prices largely offset the production gains cost of sales increased to 99 6 million 2017 86 3 million reflecting greater purchases of external ffb and increased estate ope rating costs due to higher volumes costs of remedial upkeep and an unusually high requirement for downstream loading nevertheless estate operating costs increased at a lower rate than ffb volumes pre tax loss of 5 5 million 2017 loss 21 9 million after reflecting a gain on the disposal of pbj of 10 4 million net indebtedness at 189 5 million 2017 211 7 million with existing bank facilities repaid and replaced in 2018 with new longer dated facilities to align better with projected future cash flows further discussions with indonesian bankers to refinance bank loan repayments falling due in 2019 and reduce interest costs through partial conversion of rupiah loans to dollars provision for deferred tax increased by 9 5 million resulting in tax charge of 12 7 million 2017 3 0 million agricultural operations 51 per cent increase in ffb production to 800 050 tonnes 2017 530 565 tonnes reflecting the benefit of close focus on field disciplines and supervision increase in third party ffb purchased to 191 228 tonnes 2017 114 005 tonnes extraction rates generally stable despite some logistical challenges associated with sudden crop increase cpo averaging 22 5 per cent 2017 22 8 per cent yields grew by 48 per cent to 23 1 tonnes per mature hectare 2017 15 6 tonnes per mature hectare 2018 extension planting largely concentrated on pbj to maximise proceeds from pbj disposal coal operations access to and licensing of the loading point on the mahakam river secured in preparation for mining at the kota bangun concession existing coal stockpile of 16 000 tonnes from previous mining operations sold dewatering recently completed giving access to the kota bangun northern pit outlook record production in 2018 expected to be followed by a further increase in 2019 to some 900 000 tonnes of ffb with 166 000 tonnes in first quarter 2017 135 000 indications that the cpo price recovery will continue through 2019 and beyond as global consumption of palm oil increases production reduces and restocking continues undeveloped land bank of 6 000 hectares immediately available for extension planting but programme on hold pending further recovery in cpo price capacity of the third oil mill to be increased to 80 tonnes per hour to meet rising crop levels with work expected to be completed in second half of 2019 in time for peak cropping period discussions advanced with potential partners and third party contractors for the resumption of coal mining at kota bangun chairman s statement while 2018 saw continued improvement in crop production and yields the financial results were dominated by the marked fall in crude palm oil cpo prices particularly during the second half of the year and the consequent impact on profitability foreign exchange gains which positively impacted results in the first half of the year principally as a result of the decline in the value of the indonesian rupiah against the us dollar were partly reversed during the second half of the year as a consequence the group s overall financial performance for the year was less than might have been expected total revenue for 2018 amounted to 105 5 million compared with 100 2 million in 2017 reflecting the impact of weak cpo prices on production that increased by more than 50 per cent on the previous year while cpo prices have recovered significantly since the year end they have not yet rallied to the levels seen at the beginning of 2018 the loss before tax for 2018 was 5 5 million this included a profit on disposal of pt putra bongan jaya pbj of 10 4 million the latter figure differs from the loss of 8 0 million estimated by the group in its announcement of 11 february 2019 because of two technical adjustments involving the release of deferred tax liabilities and prior year translation gains relating to pbj fresh fruit bunches ffb harvested amounted to some 800 000 tonnes compared with 530 000 tonnes in 2017 surpassing the group s previous highest production and producing a yield per mature hectare of 23 tonnes compared with 16 tonnes in 2017 these yields take account of the pbj sale which led to slight decrease in mature hectarage from 34 076 hectares to 33 292 hectares in 2018 ffb purchases from smallholders and other third parties also increased significantly to some 191 000 tonnes compared with 114 000 tonnes in 2017 cpo production totalled 218 000 tonnes in 2018 compared with the 144 000 tonnes in 2017 notwithstanding a more rigorous maintenance programme the rapid escalation of throughput in the second half of the year with consequent pressure on evacuation and increased equipment wear and tear restricted overall cpo extraction rates which decreased to 22 5 per cent compared with 22 8 per cent in 2017 crude palm kernel oil cpko extraction rates however improved to 40 2 per cent compared with 38 0 per cent in 2017 overall yields for cpo and cpko were respectively 5 4 and 0 4 tonnes per mature hectare compared with respectively 3 6 and 0 3 tonnes per hectare in 2017 changes to work programmes and new incentive targets for harvesters contributed to steady improvements in efficiencies in the field through the year and contributed to effective management of the sudden upsurge in crop with crop levels continuing to increase the group is pushing ahead with the expansion of the group s newest mill to almost double its capacity to 80 tonnes per hour to ensure adequate processing capacity going forward these works are expected to be completed in time for the peak cropping period in the second half of the year the cpo price cif rotterdam fell sharply over 2018 from 677 per tonne to a low in mid november of 439 per tonne on the back of considerably higher levels of cpo production in indonesia and malaysia and increasing stocks of cpo and other vegetable oils worldwide prices started to recover towards the end of the year closing the year at 506 per tonne and this trend has continued albeit with some intermittent volatility into 2019 as the supply surplus has started to reduce the cpo price currently stands at 536 per tonne indications are that prices will recover further during 2019 and beyond as consumption increases fuelled by restocking and the expansion of biodiesel usage and stock levels at origin gradually reduce with the seasonal slowdown in production in the first half of the year cpko prices were similarly affected by a supply surplus opening at 1260 per tonne cif rotterdam in 2018 declining to 651 per tonne in november and closing the year at 783 per tonne the cpko price cif rotterdam is currently at 594 per tonne the group has an undeveloped land bank with some 6 000 hectares immediately available for extension planting while nursery areas have been established to ensure availability of seedlings for later development the directors have decided to wait for further recovery in the cpo price before recommencing any expansion preparations to reopen the mine at the group s principal coal concession interest at kota bangun are progressing with dewatering of the site recently completed having secured access to a loading point on the mahakam river and a licence to export coal the group disposed of the existing stockpile of some 16 000 tonnes during 2018 refurbishment of the port loading point and conveyor acquired during 2018 should be completed in the next few months discussions with potential third party contractors are reaching an advanced stage the group continues to be financed by a combination of debt and equity total equity including preference share capital amounted to 261 3 million as at 31 december 2018 compared to 276 7 million as at 31 december 2017 net indebtedness at 31 december 2018 amounted to 189 5 million compared with 211 7 million as at 31 december 2017 in august 2018 two new rupiah bank facilities equivalent in total to some 32 2 million were arranged and drawn and certain existing facilities amounting to 10 3 million were repaid subsequently to align better the repayment profile of the group s bank loans with projected future cash flows two further new rupiah loans equivalent to some 82 2 million were arranged and drawn and existing shorter dated facilities of some 59 4 million were repaid in view of the financial performance of the group in 2018 the directors have not declared or recommended the payment of any ordinary dividend in respect of the year production in the first months of 2019 was well ahead of the levels achieved in the same period in 2018 with group ffb to the end of march of 166 000 tonnes 2018 135 000 tonnes some slowdown in production can be expected through to the middle of the year in line with the normal monthly phasing of crops but indications are that production for the year overall will be comfortably ahead of 2018 with a budgeted ffb crop of some 900 000 tonnes while the directors remain optimistic about the operations and the prospects for the group there remains much to be done this year to ensure that the group realises its full potential it will be particularly important to maximise ffb collection and optimise evacuation and processing to this end capital expenditure will be focused on works that will ensure resilience and availability of sufficient capacity in the group s mills with current cpo prices still at depressed levels albeit that prices are significantly ahead of those of the last quarter of 2018 measures are also in hand to reduce costs particularly in administrative and support departments it should also be possible to reduce the employment of temporary workers for remedial upkeep as the work being undertaken is progressively completed to ensure the availability of sufficient funding to meet the costs of the third mill extension and planned enhancements to the group s other mills the group is in discussion with its indonesian bankers regarding a further facility of some 11 million there are also continuing discussions aimed at reducing interest costs by conversion of a proportion of the group s rupiah loans to dollar loans looking ahead cpo prices are expected to increase further with continued growth in consumption and a general slowdown in cpo production with fewer new plantings in both indonesia and malaysia subject to this proving the case further improvements in operating performance are expected to translate into an improvement in underlying profitability and cash flows through 2019 and thereafter finally i would like to welcome rizal satar who joined the board in december 2018 as an independent non executive director rizal was educated in the united states and belgium where he majored in computer science accounting and finance and worked for 20 years for pricewaterhousecoopers indonesia as a senior partner in their advisory services business david j blackett chairman dividends the ﬁxed semi annual dividends on the 9 per cent cumulative preference shares that fell due on 30 june and 31 december were duly paid in view of the results reported for 2018 the directors have concluded that they should not declare or recommend the payment of any dividend on the ordinary shares in respect of 2018 annual general meeting the fifty ninth annual general meeting of r e a holdings plc will be held at the london office of ashurst llp at 1 duval square london fruit and wool exchange london e1 6pw on 20 june 2019 at 10 00 am risks and uncertainties the group s business involves risks and uncertainties identification assessment management and mitigation of the risks associated with environmental social and governance matters forms part of the group s system of internal control for which the board of the company has ultimate responsibility the board discharges that responsibility as described in corporate governance in the annual report those risks and uncertainties that the directors currently consider to be material are described below there are or may be other risks and uncertainties faced by the group that the directors currently deem immaterial or of which they are unaware that may have a material adverse impact on the group the risks detailed below as relating to agricultural operations expansion and coal and stone operations are prospective rather than immediate material risks because the group is currently not expanding its agricultural operations and not mining its coal and stone concessions however such risks will apply when as is contemplated expansion and mining are resumed the effect of an adverse incident relating to the coal and stone operations as referred to below could impact the ability of the coal and stone companies to repay their loans material risks related policies and the group s successes and failures with respect to environmental social and governance matters and the measures taken in response to any failures are described in more detail under sustainability in the annual report where risks are reasonably capable of mitigation the group seeks to mitigate them beyond that the directors endeavour to manage the group s finances on a basis that leaves the group with some capacity to withstand adverse impacts from identified areas of risk but such management cannot provide insurance against every possible eventuality the directors have carefully reviewed the potential impact on its operations of the various possible outcomes to the current discussions on the termination of uk membership of the european union brexit the directors expect that certain outcomes may result in a movement in sterling against the us dollar and indonesian rupiah with consequential impact on the group dollar translation of its sterling costs and sterling liabilities the directors do not believe that such impact which could be positive or negative would be material in the overall context of the group were there to be an outcome that resulted in a reduction in uk interest rates this may negatively impact the level of the technical provisions of the rea pension scheme but given the scheme s estimated funding position the directors do not expect that this impact would be material in the overall context of the group beyond this and considering that the group s entire operations are in indonesia the directors do not see brexit as posing a significant risk to the group the directors have considered the potential impact on the group of global climate change between 5 and 10 per cent of the group s existing plantings are in areas that are low lying and prone to flooding if not protected by bunding were climate change to cause an increase in water levels in the rivers running though the estates this could be expected to increase the requirement for bunding or if the increase was so extreme that bunding became impossible could lead to the loss of low lying plantings the percentage of which could be expected to increase changes to levels and regularity of rainfall and sunlight hours could also adversely affect production however it seems likely that any climate change impact negatively affecting group production would similarly affect many other oil palm growers in south east asia leading to a reduction in cpo and cpko supply this would be likely to result in higher prices for cpo and cpko which should provide at least some offset against reduced production risks assessed by the directors as being of particular significance are those detailed below under agricultural operations produce prices general funding agricultural operations climatic factors agricultural operations other operational factors the directors assessment as respects produce prices and funding reflects the key importance of those risks in relation to the matters considered in the viability statement in the directors report below and as respects climatic and other factors the negative impact that could result from adverse incidence of such risks risk potential impact mitigating or other relevant considerations agricultural operations climatic factors material variations from the norm in climatic conditions a loss of crop or reduction in the quality of harvest resulting in loss of potential revenue over a long period crop levels should be reasonably predictable unusually low levels of rainfall that lead to a water availability below the minimum required for the normal development of the oil palm a reduction in subsequent crop levels resulting in loss of potential revenue the reduction is likely to be broadly proportional to the cumulative size of the water deficit operations are located in an area of high rainfall notwithstanding some seasonal variations annual rainfall is usually adequate for normal development overcast conditions delayed crop formation resulting in loss of potential revenue normal sunshine hours in the location of the operations are well suited to the cultivation of oil palm low levels of rainfall disrupting river transport or in an extreme situation bringing it to a standstill inability to obtain delivery of estate supplies or to evacuate cpo and cpko possibly leading to suspension of harvesting the group has established a permanent downstream loading facility where the river is tidal in addition road access between the ports of samarinda and balikpapan and the estates offers a viable alternative route for transport with any associated additional cost more than outweighed by the potential negative impact of disruption to the business cycle by any delay in evacuating cpo cultivation risks failure to achieve optimal upkeep standards a reduction in harvested crop resulting in loss of potential revenue the group has adopted standard operating practices designed to achieve required upkeep standards pest and disease damage to oil palms and growing crops a loss of crop or reduction in the quality of harvest resulting in loss of potential revenue the group adopts best agricultural practice to limit pests and diseases other operational factors shortages of necessary inputs to the operations such as fuel and fertiliser disruption of operations or increased input costs leading to reduced profit margins the group maintains stocks of necessary inputs to provide resilience and has established biogas plants to improve its self reliance in relation to fuel a hiatus in harvesting collection or processing of ffb crops ffb crops becoming rotten or over ripe leading either to a loss of cpo production and hence revenue or to the production of cpo that has an above average free fatty acid content and is saleable only at a discount to normal market prices the group endeavours to maintain a sufficient complement of harvesters within its workforce to harvest expected crops and to maintain resilience in its palm oil mills with each of the mills operating separately and some ability within each mill to switch from steam based to biogas or diesel based electricity generation disruptions to river transport between the main area of operations and the port of samarinda or delays in collection of cpo and cpko from the transhipment terminal the requirement for cpo and cpko storage exceeding available capacity and forcing a temporary cessation in ffb harvesting or processing with a resultant loss of crop resulting in a loss of potential revenue the group s bulk storage facilities have substantial capacity and further storage facilities are afforded by the fleet of barges together these have hitherto always proved adequate to meet the group s requirements for cpo and cpko storage and may be expanded to accommodate anticipated increases in production occurrence of an uninsured or inadequately insured adverse event certain risks such as crop loss through fire or other perils for which insurance cover is either not available or is considered disproportionately expensive are not insured material loss of potential revenues or claims against the group the group maintains insurance at levels that it considers reasonable against those risks that can be economically insured and mitigates uninsured risks to the extent reasonably feasible by management practices produce prices volatility of cpo and cpko prices which as primary commodities may be affected by levels of world economic activity and factors affecting the world economy including levels of inflation and interest rates reduced revenue from the sale of cpo and cpko production and a consequent reduction in cash flow price swings should be moderated by the fact that the annual oilseed crops account for the major proportion of world vegetable oil production and producers of such crops can reduce or increase their production within a relatively short time frame restriction on sale of the group s cpo and cpko at world market prices including restrictions on indonesian exports of palm products and imposition of high export duties as has occurred in the past for short periods reduced revenue from the sale of cpo and cpko production and a consequent reduction in cash flow the indonesian government allows the free export of cpo and cpko but applies a sliding scale of duties on exports which is varied from time to time in response to prevailing prices to allow producers economic margins the extension of this sliding scale to incorporate an export levy to fund biodiesel subsidies is designed to support the local price of cpo and cpko distortion of world markets for cpo and cpko by the imposition of import controls or taxes in consuming countries for example by imposition of reciprocal trade barriers or tariffs between major economies depression of selling prices for cpo and cpko if arbitrage between markets for competing vegetable oils proves insufficient to compensate for the market distortion created the imposition of controls or taxes on cpo or cpko in one area can be expected to result in greater consumption of alternative vegetable oils within that area and the substitution outside that area of cpo and cpko for other vegetable oils expansion failure to secure in full or delays in securing the land or funding required for the group s planned extension planting programme inability to complete or delays in completing the planned extension planting programme with a consequential reduction in the group s prospective growth the group holds significant fully titled or allocated land areas suitable for planting it works continuously to maintain up to date permits for the planting of these areas and aims to manage its finances to ensure in so far as practicable that it will be able to fund any planned extension planting programme a shortfall in achieving the group s planned extension planting programme impacting negatively the continued growth of the group a possible adverse effect on market perceptions as to the value of the company s securities the group maintains flexibility in its planting programme to be able to respond to changes in circumstances environmental social and governance practices failure by the agricultural operations to meet the standards expected of them as a large employer of significant economic importance to local communities reputational and financial damage the group has established standard practices designed to ensure that it meets its obligations monitors performance against those practices and investigates thoroughly and takes action to prevent recurrence in respect of any failures identified criticism of the group s environmental practices by conservation organisations scrutinising land areas that fall within a region that in places includes substantial areas of unspoilt primary rain forest inhabited by diverse flora and fauna reputational and financial damage the group is committed to sustainable development of oil palm and has obtained rspo certification for most of its current operations all group oil palm plantings are on land areas that have been previously logged and zoned by the indonesian authorities as appropriate for agricultural development the group maintains substantial conservation reserves that safeguard landscape level biodiversity community relations a material breakdown in relations between the group and the host population in the area of the agricultural operations disruption of operations including blockages restricting access to oil palm plantings and mills resulting in reduced and poorer quality cpo and cpko production the group seeks to foster mutually beneficial economic and social interaction between the local villages and the agricultural operations in particular the group gives priority to applications for employment from members of the local population encourages local farmers and tradesmen to act as suppliers to the group its employees and their dependents and promotes smallholder development of oil palm plantings disputes over compensation payable for land areas allocated to the group that were previously used by local communities for the cultivation of crops or as respects which local communities otherwise have rights disruption of operations including blockages restricting access to the area the subject of the disputed compensation the group has established standard procedures to ensure fair and transparent compensation negotiations and encourages the local authorities with whom the group has developed good relations and who are therefore generally supportive of the group to assist in mediating settlements individuals party to a compensation agreement subsequently denying or disputing aspects of the agreement disruption of operations including blockages restricting access to the areas the subject of the compensation disputed by the affected individuals where claims from individuals in relation to compensation agreements are found to have a valid basis the group seeks to agree a new compensation arrangement where such claims are found to be falsely based the group encourages appropriate action by the local authorities coal and stone operations operational factors failure by external contractors to achieve agreed production volumes with optimal stripping values or extraction rates loss of prospective revenue the group endeavours to use experienced contractors to supervise them closely and to take care to ensure that they have equipment of capacity appropriate for the planned production volumes external factors in particular weather delaying or preventing delivery of extracted coal and stone delays to receipt or loss of revenue deliveries are not normally time critical and adverse external factors would not normally have a continuing impact for more than a limited period geological assessments which are extrapolations based on statistical sampling proving inaccurate unforeseen extraction complications causing cost overruns and production delays or failure to achieve projected production the group seeks to ensure the accuracy of geological assessments of any extraction programme prices volatility of international coal prices and local competition reducing stone prices reduced revenue and a consequent reduction in cash flow and profit the high quality of the coal in the group s main coal concession may limit volatility there are currently no other stone quarries in the vicinity of the group s deposits and the cost of transporting stone should restrict competition imposition of additional royalties or duties on the extraction of stone or coal reduced revenue and a consequent reduction in cash flow and profit the indonesian government has not to date imposed measures that would seriously affect the viability of indonesian stone quarrying or coal mining operations unforeseen variations in quality of deposits inability to supply product within the specifications that are at any particular time in demand with consequent loss of revenue geological assessments ahead of commencement of extraction operations should have identified any material variations in quality environmental social and governance practices failure by the coal and stone operations to meet the expected standards reputational and financial damage the areas of the coal and stone concessions are relatively small and should not be difficult to supervise the group is committed to international standards of best environmental and social practice and in particular to proper management of waste water and reinstatement of quarried and mined areas on completion of extraction operations general currency strengthening of sterling or the indonesian rupiah against the dollar adverse exchange movements on those components of group costs and funding that arise in indonesian rupiah or sterling as respects costs and sterling denominated shareholder capital the group considers that this risk is inherent in the group s business and structure and must simply be accepted as respects borrowings where practicable the group seeks to borrow in dollars but when borrowing in another currency considers it better to accept the resultant currency risk than to hedge that risk with hedging instruments funding bank debt repayment instalments and other debt maturities coincide with periods of adverse trading and negotiations with bankers and investors are not successful in rescheduling instalments extending maturities or otherwise concluding satisfactory refinancing arrangements inability to meet liabilities as they fall due the group maintains good relations with its bankers and other holders of debt who have generally been receptive to reasonable requests to moderate debt profiles when circumstances require moreover the directors believe that the fundamentals of the group s business will facilitate procurement of additional equity capital should this prove necessary counterparty risk default by a supplier customer or financial institution loss of any prepayment unpaid sales proceeds or deposit the group maintains strict controls over its financial exposures which include regular reviews of the creditworthiness of counterparties and limits on exposures to counterparties sales are generally made on the basis of cash against documents regulatory exposure new and changes to laws and regulations that affect the group including in particular laws and regulations relating to land tenure work permits for expatriate staff and taxation restriction on the group s ability to retain its current structure or to continue operating as currently the directors are not aware of any specific planned changes that would adversely affect the group to a material extent current regulations restricting the size of oil palm growers in indonesia will not impact the group for the foreseeable future breach of the various continuing conditions attaching to the group s land rights and the coal and stone quarry concessions including conditions requiring utilisation of the rights and concessions or failure to maintain all permits and licences required for the group s operations civil sanctions and in an extreme case loss of the affected rights or concessions the group endeavours to ensure compliance with the continuing conditions attaching to its land rights and concessions and that activities are conducted within the terms of the licences and permits that are held and that licences and permits are obtained and renewed as necessary failure by the group to meet the standards expected in relation to bribery corruption and slavery reputational damage and criminal sanctions the group has traditionally had and continues to maintain strong controls in this area because indonesia where all of the group s operations are located has been classified as relatively high risk by the international transparency corruption perceptions index restrictions on foreign investment in indonesian mining concessions limiting the effectiveness of co investment arrangements with local partners constraints on the group s ability to earn an equity return on its investment maintenance of good relations with local partners to ensure that returns appropriately reflect agreed arrangements country exposure deterioration in the political or economic situation in indonesia difficulties in maintaining operational standards particularly if there was a consequential deterioration in the security situation in the recent past indonesia has been stable and the indonesian economy has continued to grow but in the late 1990s indonesia experienced severe economic turbulence and there have been subsequent occasional instances of civil unrest often attributed to ethnic tensions in certain parts of indonesia the group has never since the inception of its east kalimantan operations in 1989 been adversely affected by regional security problems introduction of exchange controls or other restrictions on foreign owned operations in indonesia restriction on the transfer of fees interest and dividends from indonesia to the uk with potential consequential negative implications for the servicing of uk obligations and payment of dividends loss of effective management control the directors are not aware of any circumstances that would lead them to believe that under current political conditions any indonesian government authority would impose exchange controls or otherwise seek to restrict the group s freedom to manage its operations mandatory reduction of foreign ownership of indonesian plantation operations forced divestment of interests in indonesia at below market values with consequential loss of value the group accepts there is a significant possibility that foreign owners may be required over time to divest partially ownership of indonesian oil palm operations but has no reason to believe that such divestment would be at anything other than market value moreover the group has local participation in all its indonesian subsidiaries miscellaneous relationships disputes with staff and employees disruption of operations and consequent loss of revenues the group appreciates its material dependence upon its staff and employees and endeavours to manage this dependence in accordance with international employment standards as detailed under employees in sustainability of the annual report breakdown in relationships with the local shareholders in the company s indonesian subsidiaries reliance on the indonesian courts for enforcement of the agreements governing its arrangements with local partners with the uncertainties that any juridical process involves and with any failure of enforcement likely to have a material negative impact on the value of the coal and stone operations because the concessions are at the moment legally owned by the group s local partners the group endeavours to maintain cordial relations with its local investors by seeking their support for decisions affecting their interests and responding constructively to any concerns that they may have viability statement the group s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position are described in the strategic report above which also provides under the heading finance a description of the group s cash ﬂow liquidity and ﬁnancing adequacy and treasury policies in addition note 24 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements includes information as to the group s policy objectives and processes for managing capital its ﬁnancial risk management objectives details of ﬁnancial instruments and hedging policies and exposures to credit and liquidity risks the risks and uncertainties section of the strategic report describes the material risks faced by the group and actions taken to mitigate those risks in particular there are risks associated with the group s local operating environment and the group is materially dependent upon selling prices for crude palm oil cpo and crude palm kernel oil cpko over which it has no control as respects funding risk the group has material indebtedness in the form of bank loans and listed notes some 9 1 million of bank indebtedness falls due for repayment during 2019 and a further 52 3 million over the period 2020 to 2022 in addition 30 9 million 39 1 million of 8 75 per cent guaranteed sterling notes 2020 the sterling notes will become repayable in august 2020 and 24 0 million of 7 5 per cent dollar notes 2022 the dollar notes will become repayable in june 2022 in view of the material component of the group s indebtedness falling due in the period to 31 december 2022 as described above the directors have chosen this period for their assessment of the long term viability of the group with the improvement in operating performance and cpo prices ﬁrming since 2018 the group s plantation operations can be expected to generate increasing cash ﬂows going forward in addition the arrangements to recommence operations at the group s principal coal concession can be expected to enhance future cash ﬂow whilst the group hopes to resume its extension planting programme when funding permits for the moment this is on hold moreover the successful completion of the divestment of pt putra bongan jaya in 2018 and the extension of the group s third mill to almost double its capacity in 2019 means that the group is unlikely to require an additional mill for several years if at all accordingly the group can reasonably expect that from 2020 onwards a much greater proportion of operational cash ﬂows will be available to reduce debt than has been the case for many years in 2019 the group will still incur signiﬁcant capital expenditure on the third mill extension necessary enhancements to the other mills and upkeep of existing immature areas to ensure the availability of sufﬁcient funding for these purposes the group is at an advanced stage in discussions to reﬁnance the bank indebtedness falling due in 2019 with longer term bank indebtedness following completion of this reﬁnancing the group will resume discussions with its indonesian bankers on reduction of interest costs by conversion of a proportion of the group s rupiah loans to dollar loans the directors expect that the improving outlook for the group s internally generated cash ﬂows will permit the group to repay the group indebtedness falling due for repayment during the period of assessment other than a proportion of the sterling notes falling due for repayment in 2020 which the directors would expect to be able to reﬁnance with new notes however should this not prove the case or should additional funding otherwise be required the group will seek to raise additional capital by an issue of shares or of a share linked instrument based on the foregoing and after making enquiries the directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period to 31 december 2022 and to remain viable during that period going concern material risks faced by the group are set out in the risks and uncertainties section of the strategic report with an indication of those risks regarded by the directors as potentially signiﬁcant together with mitigating and other relevant considerations for the management of risks financing policies are described on pages 33 and 34 of the strategic report and 2018 developments relating to capital structure are detailed in the finance section of the strategic report under capital structure the directors have set out their assessment of liquidity and ﬁnancing adequacy on pages 32 and 33 of the strategic report based on the foregoing having made due enquiries the directors reasonably expect that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements and therefore they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the ﬁnancial statements directors confirmation of responsibility the directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and

national economic council chairman larry kudlow appears on fox business to discuss the latest strong economic numbers including gdp growth rising wages low inflation and strong capital investment additionally kudlow discusses current status of u s trade negotiations with china and a looming battle against the decpeticons for usmca chuck grassley the constitution assigns congress the task of regulating foreign commerce the house and senate must pass legislation implementing usmca as chairman of the finance committee i m leading the senate effort i ve been involved in the passage of every u s free trade agreement and it s never easy reorganizing a massive economic relationship affects many constituencies and that s inevitably complicated i ve met with congressional colleagues as well as u s canadian and mexican trade officials to discuss how our nations will secure legislative approval of usmca a significant roadblock is the administration s tariffs on steel and aluminum and retaliatory canadian and mexican tariffs on u s products these levies are a tax on americans and they jeopardize usmca s prospects of passage in the mexican congress canadian parliament and u s congress canadian and mexican trade officials may be more delicate in their language but they re diplomats i m not if these tariffs aren t lifted usmca is dead there is no appetite in congress to debate usmca with these tariffs in place many americans have been harmed by retaliatory tariffs mexican tariffs on u s pork to take one example have lowered the value of live hogs by 12 an animal iowa is the top pork producing state in the country that means jobs wages and communities are hurt every day these tariffs continue as i hear directly from iowans it s time for the tariffs to go more on the latest op ed by iowa decepticon senator chuck grassley as i mentioned last week the grassley johnson letter to ag bill barr is exhibit a in how dc attempts to leverage their own financial interests against the outsider that is donald trump senate finance chairman grassley s move last week was a shot across the bow but generally only noticed by those who travel the deep weeds of corrupt dc leverage strategy essentially grassley saying he won t allow trump to expose the deep state corruption unless trump concedes to wall street s demands on trade deals it only took a few days for the evidence of this leverage move to surface as grassley acting on behalf of his k street donors writes an op ed stating if trump doesn t drop the steel and aluminum tariffs then he can consider the usmca dead an absolutely typical decepticon move the op ed itself is a clear example of pure globalist trade bs for many reasons forgive me if my language turns curt but cth has been battling this exact issue for a long time hogwash the 1 contract owner of pork is smithfield now a chinese company the price of pork is more related to the ongoing u s china trade negotiation than any mexican reciprocal tariff additionally the usmca terms were negotiated with mexico agreeing to them as constructed grassley is being intentionally obtuse it s not mexico taking exception to the steel and aluminum tariffs it is the u s specifically the u s chamber of commerce ie wall street sure mexico and canada would love to keep their access to the u s market as open as possible and water down any position that increases the u s economy however it is congress who are currently positioning themselves to eliminate the u s benefit not mexico and canada these decepticons are doing the bidding of the multinationals that control wall street and attempting to keep their place at the k street donor trough iowa senator grassley is 100 owned by bigag and president trump has already given grassley a big win with the continuance of a ridiculous ethanol subsidy now grassley wants more on behalf of his benefactors this is what we are up against purchased politicians doing the bidding of multinational corporate interests and simultaneously trying to hide their motives these are the worst of the decepticons this is why they can never be trusted it must be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to plan more doubtful of success nor more dangerous to manage than a new system for the initiator has the enmity of all who would profit by the preservation of the old institution and merely lukewarm defenders in those who gain by the new ones niccolò machiavelli potus trump is disrupting the global order of things in order to protect and preserve the shrinking interests of the u s he is fighting almost single handed at the threshold of the abyss our interests our position is zero sum our opposition seeks to repel and retain the status quo they were on the cusp of full economic victory over the u s reuters article link summary of action president trump structuring a plan to break up multinational big ag and their controlled markets stop in the interim to return to supply side principles potus trump proposes a bridge subsidy approach to wean farmers off exploitative globalist multinational contract farming stop in this endeavor president trump and mexican president lopez obrador will be brothers in arms fullstop president trump is disrupting decades of multinational financial interests who use the u s as a host for their ideological endeavors president trump is confronting multinational corporations and the global constructs of economic systems that were put in place to the detriment of the host usa ie you or in this example the u s farmer there are trillions at stake it is all about the economics all else is chaff and countermeasures familiar faces perhaps faces you previously thought were decent are now revealing their alignment with larger entities that are our abusers in an effort to awaken the victim to the cycle of self destructive codependent behavior allow me to cue a recent audio visual example from u s senator john thune watch start with the so called big six monsanto syngenta dow agrosciences dupont bayer and basf produce roughly three quarters of the pesticides used in the world the first five also sell more than half the name brand seeds that farmers plant including varieties modified for resistance to the very pesticides they also sell meanwhile if farmers want fertilizer a list of 10 other companies starting with potashcorp account for about two thirds of the world market once the plowing planting nurturing and harvesting are done around 80 percent of major crops pass through the hands of four traders adm bunge cargill and louis dreyfus these companies aren t just financiers of course cargill for example produces animal feed and many other products and it supplies more than a fifth of all meat sold in the united states and if you ever had any ideas about going vegetarian to avoid the conglomerates forget about it adm processes about a third of all soybeans in the united states and a sixth of those grown around the globe it also brews more than 5 6 billion liters of ethanol for gasoline and pours more than 2 million metric tons of high fructose corn syrup every year and it produces a sixth of the world s chocolate continue and go deep what south dakota senator john thune is showcasing here is his full alignment with big multinational corporate agriculture big ag big ag is not supporting local farmers big ag does not support free and fair markets big ag supports the interests of multinational corporations and multinational financial interests for those interests the u s is the host from our perspective they are the parasite it is critical to think of big ag in the same way we already are familiar with multinational manufacturing of durable goods we are already familiar how china mexico and asean nations export our raw materials ore coking coal rare earth minerals etc the raw materials are used to manufacture goods overseas the cheap durable goods are then shipped back into the u s for purchase it is within this decades long process where we lost the manufacturing base and the multinational economic planners world trade organization put us on a path to being a service driven economy the road to a service driven economy is paved with a great disparity between financial classes the wealth gap is directly related to the inability of the middle class to thrive elite financial interests including those within washington dc gain wealth and power the u s workforce is reduced to servitude service of their affluent needs the destruction of the u s industrial and manufacturing base is exactly why the wealth gap has exploded in the past 30 years with that familiarity did you think the multinationals would stop with only durable goods they don t they didn t the exact same exfiltration and exploitation has been happening with increased speed over the past 15 20 years with consumable goods ie food raw material foodstuff is exported to china asean nations and mexico processed and shipped back into the u s as a finished product recent example salmonella ritz bits whey nabisco shuts new jersey manufacturing plant moves food production to mexico the result this is the same design flow with food as previously exploited by other economic sectors including auto manufacturing archer daniels midland adm monsanto nestlé pepsico bunge potash corp cargill or wilmar stay out of the public eye by design most megafood conglomerates have roots going back a century or more but ever increasing consolidation means that their current corporate owners may have been established only a few years ago welcome to the complex world of big ag multinational corporations big ag are now invested in controlling the outputs of u s agricultural industry and farmers this process is why food prices have risen exponentially in the past decade the free market is not determining price there is no supply and demand influence within this modern agricultural dynamic food commodities are now a controlled market just like durable goods the raw material harvests writ large are exploited by the financial interests of massive multinational corporations this is contract farming again if we were to pull out of nafta our food bill would drop 25 or more within the first year further if u s supply and demand were part of the domestic market price for food we would see the prices of aggregate food products drop by half almost immediately some perishable food products would predictably drop so dramatically in price it is unfathomable how far the prices would fall behind this dynamic we find the international corporate and financial interests who are inherently at risk from president trump s america first economic and trade platform believe it or not president trump is up against an entire world economic establishment when we understand how trade works in the modern era we understand why the agents within the system are so adamantly opposed to u s president trump the biggest lie in modern economics willingly spread and maintained by corporate media is that a system of global markets still exists it doesn t every element of global economic trade is controlled and exploited by massive institutions multinational banks and multinational corporations institutions like the world trade organization wto and world bank control trillions of dollars in economic activity underneath that economic activity there are people who hold the reigns of power over the outcomes these individuals and groups are the stakeholders in direct opposition to principles of america first national economics the modern financial constructs of these entities have been established over the course of the past three decades when you understand how they manipulate the economic system of individual nations you begin to understand understand why they are so fundamentally opposed to president trump in the western world separate from communist control perspectives ie china global markets are a modern myth nothing more than a talking point meant to keep people satiated with sound bites they might find familiar global markets have been destroyed over the past three decades by multinational corporations who control the products formerly contained within global markets the same is true for commodities markets the multinational trade and economic system run by corporations and multinational banks now controls the product outputs of independent nations the free market economic system has been usurped by entities who create what is best described as controlled markets u s president trump smartly understands what has taken place additionally he uses economic leverage as part of a broader national security policy and to understand who opposes president trump specifically because of the economic leverage he creates it becomes important to understand the objectives of the global and financial elite who run and operate the institutions the big club understanding how trillions of trade dollars influence geopolitical policy we begin to understand the three decade global financial construct they seek to protect that is global financial exploitation of national markets four basic elements multinational corporations purchase controlling interests in various national outputs harvests an raw materials and ancillary industries of developed industrial western nations example the multinational corporations making the purchases are underwritten by massive global financial institutions multinational banks note in china it is the communist government underwriting the purchase the multinational banks and the multinational corporations then utilize lobbying interests to manipulate the internal political policy of the targeted nation state s with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint against the backdrop of president trump confronting china and against the backdrop of nafta being renegotiated likely to exit and against the necessary need to support the key u s steel industry revisiting the economic influences within the modern import export dynamic will help conceptualize the issues at the heart of the matter there are a myriad of interests within each trade sector that make specific explanation very challenging however here s the basic outline for three decades economic globalism has advanced quickly everyone accepts this statement yet few actually stop to ask who and what are behind this and why influential people with vested financial interests in the process have sold a narrative that global manufacturing global sourcing and global production was the inherent way of the future the same voices claimed the american economy was consigned to become a service driven economy what was always missed in these discussions is that advocates selling this global economy message have a vested financial and ideological interest in convincing the information consumer it is all just a natural outcome of economic progress it s not it s not natural at all it is a process that is entirely controlled promoted and utilized by large conglomerates lobbyists purchased politicians and massive financial corporations again i ll try to retain the larger altitude perspective without falling into the traps of the esoteric weeds i freely admit this is tough to explain and i may not be successful bulletpoint 1 multinational corporations purchase controlling interests in various national elements of developed industrial western nations this is perhaps the most challenging to understand in essence thanks specifically to the way the world trade organization wto was established in 1995 national companies expanded their influence into multiple nations across a myriad of industries and economic sectors energy agriculture raw earth minerals etc this is the basic underpinning of national companies becoming multinational corporations think of these multinational corporations as global entities now powerful enough to reach into multiple nations simultaneously and purchase controlling interests in a single economic commodity a historic reference point might be the original multinational enterprise energy via oil production exxon mobil bp etc however in the modern global world it s not just oil the resource and product procurement extends to virtually every possible commodity and industry from the very visible wheat corn to the obscure small minerals and even flowers bulletpoint 2 the multinational corporations making the purchases are underwritten by massive global financial institutions multinational banks during the past several decades national companies merged the largest lemon producer company in brazil merges with the largest lemon company in mexico merges with the largest lemon company in argentina merges with the largest lemon company in the u s etc etc national companies formerly of one nation become continental companies with control over an entire continent of nations or it could be over several continents or even the entire world market of lemon widget production these are now multinational corporations they hold interests in specific segments this example lemons across a broad variety of individual nations national laws on monopoly building are not the same in all nations most are not as structured as the u s a or other more developed nations with more laws during the acquisition phase when encountering a highly developed nation with monopoly laws the process of an umbrella corporation might be needed to purchase the targeted interests within a specific nation the example of monsanto applies here bulletpoint 3 the multinational banks and the multinational corporations then utilize lobbying interests to manipulate the internal political policy of the targeted nation state s with control of the majority of actual lemons the multinational corporation now holds a different set of financial values than a local farmer or national market this is why commodities exchanges are essentially dead in the aggregate the mercantile exchange is no longer a free or supply based market it is now a controlled market exploited by mega sized multinational corporations instead of the traditional supply demand equation determining prices the corporations look to see what nations can afford what prices the supply of the controlled product is then distributed to the country according to their ability to afford the price this is essentially the bastardized and politicized function of the world trade organization wto this is also how the corporations controlling wto policy maximize profits back to the lemons a corporation might hold the rights to the majority of the lemon production in brazil argentina and california florida the price the u s consumer pays for the lemons is directed by the amount of inventory distribution the controlling corporation allows in the u s if the u s lemon harvest is abundant the controlling interests will export the product to keep the u s consumer spending at peak or optimal price a u s customer might pay 2 for a lemon a mexican customer might pay 50 and a canadian 1 25 the bottom line issue is the national supply in this example harvest yield is not driving the national price because the supply is now controlled by massive multinational corporations the mistake people often make is calling this a global commodity process in the modern era this global commodity phrase is particularly nonsense a true global commodity is a process of individual nations harvesting creating a similar product and bringing that product to a global market individual nations each independently engaged in creating a similar product under modern globalism this process no longer takes place it s a complete fraud massive multinational corporations control the majority of production inside each nation and therefore control the global product market and price it is a controlled system example part of the lobbying in the food industry is to advocate for the expansion of u s taxpayer benefits to underwrite the costs of the domestic food products they control by lobbying dc these multinational corporations get congress and policy makers to expand the basis of who can use ebt and snap benefits state reimbursement rates expanding the federal subsidy for food purchases is part of the corporate profit dynamic with increased taxpayer subsidies the food price controllers can charge more domestically and export more of the product internationally taxes via subsidies go into their profit margins the corporations then use a portion of those enhanced profits in contributions to the politicians it s a circle of money in highly developed nations this multinational corporate process requires the corporation to purchase the domestic political process as above with individual nations allowing the exploitation in varying degrees as such the corporate lobbyists pay hundreds of millions to politicians for changes in policies and regulations one sector one product or one industry at a time these are specialized lobbyists example the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius cfius is an inter agency committee authorized to review transactions that could result in control of a u s business by a foreign person covered transactions in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the united states cfius operates pursuant to section 721 of the defense production act of 1950 as amended by the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 finsa section 721 and as implemented by executive order 11858 as amended and regulations at 31 c f

bulletpoint 4 with control over the targeted national industry or interest the multinationals then leverage export of the national asset exfiltration through trade agreements structured to the benefit of lesser developed nation states where they have previously established a proactive financial footprint the process of charging the u s consumer more for a product that under normal national market conditions would cost less is a process called exfiltration of wealth this is the basic premise the cornerstone behind the catch phrase globalism it is never discussed to control the market price some contracted product may even be secured and shipped with the intent to allow it to sit idle or rot it s all about controlling the price and maximizing the profit equation to gain the same 1 profit a widget multinational might have to sell 20 widgets in el salvador 25 each or two widgets in the u s 2 50 each think of the process like the historic reference of opec oil producing economic countries only in the modern era massive corporations are playing the role of opec and it s not oil being controlled thanks to the wto it s almost everything again this is highlighted in the example of taxpayers subsidizing the food sector ebt snap etc the corporations can charge u s consumers more ex more beef is exported red meat prices remain high at the grocery store but subsidized u s consumers can better afford the high prices of course if you are not receiving food payment assistance middle class you can t eat the steaks because you can t afford them not accidentally it s the same scheme in the obamacare healthcare system agriculturally multinational corporate monsanto says all your harvests are belong to us contract with us or you lose because we can control the market price of your end product downside is that once you sign that contract you agree to terms that are entirely created by the financial interests of the larger corporation not your farm the multinational agriculture lobby is massive we willingly feed the world as part of the system but you as a grocery customer pay more per unit at the grocery store because domestic supply no longer determines domestic price within the agriculture community the feed the world production export factor also drives the need for labor labor is a cost the multinational corps have a vested interest in low labor costs ergo open border policies ie willingly purchased republicans not supporting border wall etc this corrupt economic manipulation exploitation applies over multiple sectors and even in the sub sector of an industry like steel china india purchases the raw material coking coal then sells the finished good rolled steel back to the global market at a discount or it could be rubber or concrete or plastic or frozen chicken parts etc the america first trump trade doctrine upsets the entire construct of this multinational export control dynamic team trump focus exclusively on bilateral trade deals with specific trade agreements targeted toward individual nations not national corporations america first is also specific policy at a granular product level looking out for the national interests of the united states u s workers u s companies and u s consumers under president trump s trade positions balanced and fair trade with strong regulatory control over national assets exfiltration of u s national wealth is essentially stopped this puts many current multinational corporations globalists who previously took a stake hold in the u s economy with intention to export the wealth in a position of holding contracted interest of an asset they can no longer exploit perhaps now we understand better how massive multi billion multinational corporations and institutions are aligned against president trump countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate this should have taken place many years ago but as the saying goes better late than never donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 24 2018 tariffs are the greatest either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with

introduction and summary no matter how much the united states or any nation spends on its military a country cannot buy perfect security developing a defense budget will always involve making choices and taking risks moreover regardless of the size of the budget officials charged with protecting the security of the nation will always ask for more when the uniformed military complained about the size of president harry s truman s defense budgets in the late 1940s he remarked that they would not be satisfied even if given the entire federal budget 1 and president dwight d eisenhower became so outraged at his military commanders complaints to congress about the small size and distribution of his defense budget that he accused them of legalized insubordination 2 this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply the fiscal year 2020 budget may inspire the opposite response in analyzing the size and distribution of the trump administration s most recent defense budget proposal the real questions pertain to whether the administration is spending its money in a way that will actually enhance national security 3 to make this determination this report first looks at some of the factors that policymakers must consider when passing a budget to enhance the national security of the united states it then considers the failures of the trump administration s proposed budget for fy 2020 finally the report offers a solution for the budget s current shortcomings cutting the budget to 700 billion an amount that president donald trump publicly embraced shortly before the release of his own budget 4 characteristics of an effective national security budget a successful national security budget needs to adequately fund the nation s infrastructure and health care system because no country can be strong abroad until it is first strong at home for example during his presidency eisenhower prioritized building the interstate highway system over increasing the size of the defense budget this effort ran counter to the wishes of members of the military many of whom he had served with and congress who argued that the united states needed more bombers and missiles to close the perceived gaps that existed between itself and the soviet union 5 in effect eisenhower gave the u s department of defense the remainder of the federal budget after funding all his other priorities the late andrew marshall a renowned pentagon strategist noted that this strategy was smart compared with that of the former soviet union which took the opposite approach 6 the soviet union devoted a far larger portion of its economic output to the military and as a result it was not able to keep up with the u s economy something that eventually contributed to its collapse whatever amount the united states or any nation decides to spend on defense it must tax its citizens sufficiently enough so that increasing the size of the defense budget does not increase the national deficit presidents such as eisenhower military leaders such as adm mike mullen who served as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under former presidents george w bush and barack obama and national security officials such as john bolton the current white house national security adviser have recognized that increasing the size of the defense budget can be a threat to national security and have therefore recommended cutting it in an effort to mitigate this threat 7 national security is also weakened when a nation needs to borrow money to finance its debt particularly from another country or a potential competitor when former president ronald reagan realized that his defense buildup along with his tax cuts had caused the federal deficit to nearly double he approved tax increases in 1982 1983 and 1984 8 these increases undid about half of the 1981 tax cut which cut tax rates across the board by 23 percent tripled the estate tax exemption and reduced windfall profit taxes additionally in his second term reagan reduced defense spending in real terms by 10 percent 9 china too has realized that it needs to slow the growth of its defense budget in order to rein in its national debt and improve economic growth 10 from 1997 to 2015 china increased its defense budget by about 16 percent every year however as its economic growth has declined and its national debt has risen china has slowed the growth in its defense budget by more than half in fact if measured in u s dollars and at current exchange rates china s 2019 increase in defense spending is only 1 7 percent bringing its defense budget to about 178 billion in analyzing the size of the u s defense budget it is also important to recognize that much of defense funding is contained outside the department of defense and that the administration and congress must also provide sufficient funds to the other agencies that contribute to and enhance national security among these other agencies are the u s state department the u s agency for international development usaid the u s department of homeland security dhs which includes the fifth military service the coast guard the u s department of energy and the environmental protection agency epa for example the department of energy funds most of the cost of u s nuclear weapons programs in addition there are the costs of veterans benefits defense related tax expenditures and the amortization of unfunded military retirement liabilities all of which used to be part of the pentagon defense budget but are now funded by the u s department of the treasury these programs in total currently amount to nearly as much as the entire pentagon budget which includes the base budget and the overseas contingency operations oco budget more commonly known as the war fighting account 11 as they develop a defense budget policymakers must also consider what potential adversaries and allies are spending obviously the amount that adversaries spend is related to the capacity capability and readiness of their forces when dealing with competitors or potential adversaries a nation can count on not only its own forces but also the forces of its allies who would be threatened by the same competitors for example the united states european allies also see russia as a threat while its south korean and japanese allies are also concerned about china s aggressive policies furthermore any amount of defense spending needs to achieve the proper balance between funding the readiness of the current force to deal with current conflicts and modernizing or increasing the size of the force for future conflicts even if massive in size a defense budget that tilts in the wrong direction will not enhance national security in a cost effective manner moreover neither the pentagon nor any federal agency is entitled to a fixed share of the gdp or the total federal budget despite what undersecretary of the navy thomas b modly recently argued 12 regardless of economic growth the defense budget which now amounts to 3 2 percent of u s gdp should not be raised or lowered unless a national security threat increases or decreases 13 and since the pentagon is not entitled to a fixed share of the federal budget an increase in spending for programs such as health care or social security for senior citizens does not mean that defense spending should also be increased yet even without these factors politics has and will continue to have an impact on the size and distribution of the defense budget closing bases opening or closing facilities and awarding contracts will always be affected by the political interests of those involved in the decisions in 1990 then secretary of defense dick cheney learned this when he tried to cancel the v 22 osprey due to severe technological and cost problems he was stopped by the tilt rotor caucus composed of legislators from pennsylvania and texas where the v 22 was being built 14 as a result the pentagon spent billions more dollars on the project than it would have spent on helicopters with equivalent capability similarly the f 35 joint strike fighter is currently being developed and built in 47 states in congress the congressional joint strike fighter caucus which was formed in 2011 and includes members from all of these states has repeatedly tried to add more f 35s to the pentagon s budget request even though they have significant cost and readiness problems by 2014 this project was 163 billion over budget and seven years behind schedule 15 in the fy 2020 budget discussions the caucus has already asked for 102 f 35s 24 more than what the pentagon requested 16 finally whenever an outside group of retired military and former national security officials is asked to evaluate the defense budget they inevitably argue for increasing the size of the defense budget past its existing levels if funding does not increase as is normally the case and some unexpected crisis occurs the outside group can then claim that its evaluation was correct for example in 2014 shortly after the national defense panel released its assessment of the obama administration s defense plan which argued that there was a growing gap between the strategic objectives that the u s military was expected to achieve and the resources required to do so the russians annexed crimea and intervened militarily in syria 17 meanwhile in its november 2018 report the congressionally mandated national defense commission argued that the currently available resources are insufficient to meet the defense department s goals 18 the commission did not provide any specific budget numbers but a calculation by taxpayers for common sense demonstrates that the high end of the commission s proposed range would result in a pentagon budget of 972 billion in 2024 an increase of more than 200 billion from current levels 19 shortcomings of the trump administration s fy 2020 budget the trump administration proposed a fy 2019 defense budget that totaled 716 billion as well as a projected fy 2020 budget of 733 billion last year for the first time in a decade congress passed the budget before the start of the fiscal year which began on october 1 2018 giving the pentagon the entire 716 billion however the massive tax cut enacted by the republican controlled congress in 2017 at the behest of the trump administration failed to increase revenues anywhere close to the level its supporters claimed it would and the deficit exploded according to the congressional budget office cbo the 2017 tax law will increase deficits by nearly 2 trillion over the course of a decade 20 as a result in october 2018 president trump was urged by his national security adviser john bolton to order the pentagon to roll back the fy 2020 defense budget to fy 2018 levels 700 billion and enact massive reductions to all other discretionary programs in october 2018 bolton noted in a speech at the alexander hamilton institute that it is a fact that when your national debt gets to the level that ours is that it constitutes an existential threat to the society 21 he added that the pentagon can weather the storm if it spends its money more wisely many in the foreign policy establishment have claimed that such a reduction in the planned level of defense spending would be catastrophic former and current pentagon officials including some members of the national defense strategy commission which was established in 2017 to analyze whether the existing budget is adequate have echoed these claims 22 they argue that a reduction would undermine the readiness gains that the military has made since trump came into office and would prevent the expansion of the capabilities necessary to deal with china and russia u s strategic competitors that are increasing their military power yet any objective analysis would demonstrate that in this day and age a budget of 700 billion is more than enough to provide security for this nation 23 a 700 billion defense budget for fy 2020 would only be 2 percent smaller than the enacted fy 2019 budget of 716 billion and would come after a total 20 percent real increase over president barack obama s last defense budget of 620 billion in fy 2017 24 moreover it could help slow the growth of the national debt and still permit the united states to spend vastly more than china and russia which are largely considered the biggest threats to u s national security 25 in fact according to the international institute for strategic studies in 2018 russia s defense spending amounted to 43 billion and china s defense spending amounted to 168 billion 26 nevertheless defense hawks in and outside of government prevailed over those in the administration concerned about the rising deficit when the fy 2020 budget was released in march the pentagon not only received the 733 billion it was promised but also another 17 billion bringing the proposed fy 2020 defense budget to 750 billion 27 this total does not include the 94 billion for amortization of unfunded military retirement liabilities the 2 4 billion in defense related expenditures allocated to other agencies besides the department of energy or the more than 200 billion allocated to veterans with these items factored in the total defense spending for fy 2020 amounts to more than 1 1 trillion the budget is the highest it has been in real terms since fy 2010 when 200 000 troops were deployed in iraq and afghanistan it is also higher than the average budget during the cold war and the budget at the peak of the reagan buildup 28 supporters of this large budget argue as they have for the past several years that a sizable increase in budget size was necessary because the budget control act bca of 2011 placed caps on defense spending to such an extent that the military currently faces a readiness crisis and is falling behind strategic competitors russia and china 29 however as has been documented in center for american progress analyses of trump s first two budgets the bca had almost no impact on the size of the defense budget from fy 2013 to fy 2017 30 during this period congress not only gave the pentagon about 200 billion in total relief from the spending caps but according to the cbo the pentagon used about 60 percent of the oco to fund items such as the european deterrence initiative which belonged in the base budget the oco was only supposed to be used to pay for the wars in the middle east and afghanistan and therefore was not subject to the budget caps acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney appropriately labeled this a slush fund while rep adam smith d wa who serves as chairman of the house armed services committee called it foco or fake oco a gimmick to prop up deficit spending 31 all told since 60 percent of the oco money funded items that belong in the base budget the pentagon received about 400 billion in relief from the caps moreover senior enlisted leaders of the armed services the people on the front lines of u s military engagements convincingly demonstrated that there was no readiness crisis 32 in 2016 articles in the wall street journal and foreign affairs gen david petraeus arguably the most influential military leader of this century and brookings institution national security expert michael o hanlon demonstrated that not only was there no readiness crisis but the state of the u s military was awesome 33 they argued that there was therefore no need for a massive defense increase especially since the united states was already spending more on defense than the next seven largest defense spending nations in the world combined 34 nonetheless as his administration s own budget documents note since coming into office president trump has increased the level of defense spending by more than 100 billion or 15 percent in the process he has weakened national security by attempting to slash spending on programs that enhance national security and by allowing the national debt to grow to unprecedented levels 35 moreover in order to give the pentagon its 750 billion while still abiding by the bca s budget caps which remain in effect for fy 2020 and fy 2021 the trump administration admitted that it allocated 98 billion of the 169 billion oco account to items that have nothing to do with wars in which the united states is involved and that actually belong in the base budget 36 however even this figure is an underestimate it does not include for example the 6 billion allocated to the european deterrence initiative in fact only 25 billion of the fy 2020 oco account is allocated for direct war requirements and the cost for each deployed troop has risen significantly since the bca went into effect since coming into office trump has funded this defense increase by cutting back on several programs that contribute significantly to u s national security his administration s proposal for fy 2020 cuts the budgets of 13 of the 16 u s cabinet departments many of which enhance security 37 for example the epa leads the fight in combating climate change which the pentagon has consistently identified as a threat to u s national security yet it saw its budget slashed by 31 percent 38 and while the energy department has increased the amount it spends on nuclear weapons by 8 3 percent the overall budget of the department has been reduced by 10 percent 39 these cuts came at the expense of nonproliferation programs aimed at preventing the spread of fissile materials that other nations or terrorist groups could use to build nuclear or radiological weapons meanwhile the proposed cut to the budget of the state department and usaid part of the department s budget is 23 percent this would result in a 30 percent reduction in humanitarian assistance 1 billion in cuts to u s funding for international organizations and 400 million in cuts to u s peace keeping operations fourteen recently retired generals and admirals all of whom had commanded the nation s combatant commands were so alarmed by this that they objected in a letter released by the u s global leadership coalition they argued that the proposed cuts to the budgets of the state department usaid and other development agencies are wrong because diplomacy and development are essential to combating threats before they reach our shores 40 these comments echo those of retired gen colin powell a former secretary of state and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff when trump first proposed these drastic cuts in the state department fy 2018 budget powell noted that we re strongest when the face of america isn t only a soldier carrying a gun but also a diplomat negotiating peace a peace corps volunteer bringing clean water to a village or a relief worker stepping off a cargo plane as floodwaters rise 41 the fy 2020 budget also proposes cuts to education and health programs that will make it more difficult for potential military recruits to meet the physical and educational criteria necessary to join the military something that only 29 percent of them can do now 42 for example it proposes 207 billion in reductions to student loan programs in the next decade as well as 241 billion in reductions to medicaid the health care program for low income americans many of whom volunteer for the military finally even though the united states has a 600 billion shortage in infrastructure president trump s fy 2020 budget cuts funding in this area by another 5 percent 43 other than defense the only two agencies receiving a budget increase are the dhs and the u s department of veterans affairs va however much of the increase in the dhs budget goes toward border or immigration security in fact to help pay for this increase the department slashed the budget of the nation s coast guard from 10 3 billion to 9 3 billion this was done even though the coast guard was already reeling from the government shutdown during which its military members were not paid the coast guard plays a vital role in supporting all combatant commanders for example it is currently patrolling the taiwan strait in support of the pentagon s indo pacific command 44 meanwhile much of the increase in the va budget will go toward privatizing veterans health care a policy opposed by almost all of the veterans groups including disabled american veterans veterans of foreign wars and the paralyzed veterans of america 45 even if the reductions in nondefense spending are approved by congress which is unlikely the proposed trump budget would grow the debt exponentially by 2024 the united states is expected to be spending more on interest on the debt than on the department of defense and by 2029 the budget deficit is expected to exceed u s gdp 46 in february 2019 the u s government posted its largest monthly budget deficit in history 47 which means that the nation will have to borrow more money from abroad especially from china 48 finally with this unexpected boost in defense spending the pentagon which flunked its first audit is less inclined to make the tough decisions to deal with waste and cost overruns such as decisions to reduce its back office staff close excess bases or reduce the number of generals and admirals 49 the 700 billion solution on april 3 2019 the democrats on the house budget committee voted by a narrow margin to reduce the fy 2020 defense budget back to the original level of 733 billion 50 yet congress should consider cutting the budget to the 700 billion that the president embraced in october in fact the pentagon has already prepared a budget for this amount after the president and his national security adviser endorsed that number 51 this would be a critical first step in dealing with the national security crises that the proposed budget generates the first potential area for reductions is the 1 7 trillion modernization program for all three legs of the nuclear triad which former president obama was forced to embrace in order to get the two thirds senate vote needed to approve the new strategic arms reduction treaty start with russia which reduced the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons in both countries to no more than 1 550 52 president trump has not only embraced this program but through his own nuclear posture review has added two new tactical weapons to it 53 the pentagon can make substantial reductions in fy 2020 and the years ahead to its nuclear modernization program for example it could cancel the long range standoff weapon lrso a new nuclear cruise missile that experts such as former secretary of defense william perry say is not needed because the stealthy b 21 bomber will be able to penetrate even the most sophisticated air defenses 54 this step would save 713 million in fy 2020 and 18 billion for the rest of the lrso program moreover stopping production of the two new tactical nuclear weapons currently being developed would not only save about 1 billion in fy 2020 but would also save 17 billion over the next decade in addition to decreasing the risk of a nuclear war 55 as rep smith notes funding new low yield weapons would only draw us further into an unnecessary nuclear arms race and increase the risks of miscalculation 56 as congress analyzes the nation s current nuclear posture it should also pressure the administration to take up russian president vladimir putin s offer to extend the new start nuclear agreement by five years which would limit both sides to 1550 deployed strategic nuclear weapons until 2026 and allow 10 inspections each year 57 eventually the united states should also consider reducing its total nuclear arsenal to no more than 1 000 strategic warheads this would be more than enough to deter any potential nuclear threat as each of these weapons is significantly more powerful than the atomic weapons dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki it would also save substantial amounts of money moreover the nation should embrace a no first use policy meaning that it would only use nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack on the united states this would not only affirm what is in effect its real policy but would also allow the united states to take the moral high ground in this area the second area in which the pentagon should cut back is its operations and maintenance o m budget to deal with the supposed readiness crisis the trump administration increased o m spending in fy 2018 and fy 2019 by about 16 billion total or 8 percent from fy 2017 levels yet despite the large increases of the administration s first two budgets the fy 2020 budget asked for another 14 billion or a 5 percent increase to 293 billion since there is no real readiness crisis this amount could easily be reduced by 5 billion without affecting readiness there are also several conventional programs that can be altered to reduce costs for example the navy could cancel its plans not to refuel the nimitz class carrier the uss harry s truman it currently intends to retire the carrier even though it has more than half of its life expectancy left 58 given the reliability problems of the first ford class aircraft carrier 59 this would allow the navy to cancel building the third and fourth ford class carriers resulting in savings of 2 6 billion in fy 2020 and at least 30 billion over the next decade the navy should also heed the advice of the late sen john mccain r az and current acting secretary of defense patrick shanahan not to continue building large nuclear carriers 60 shanahan and key members of his staff believe that the days of the u s aircraft carrier are largely over in the face of advanced threats from china and russia in addition the air force should cancel its plans to buy eight of the outmoded f 15 eagles in 2020 for more than 1 billion and 80 total over the next five years 61 other than allowing boeing to keep its production line open there is no real reason for the air force to buy these planes which will cost more than 100 million each especially since the air force has 175 of them already and has not purchased any since 2001 congress should also reject the trump inspired pentagon plan to set up a separate space force which would in effect establish a sixth separate military service this force would have between 15 000 and 20 000 personnel and at least three four star generals and would cost between 2 billion and 13 billion over the next five years moreover it is unnecessary there is no doubt that the united states needs a space command much like the u s strategic command but it does not need a separate service establishing a separate armed force to deal with the threats of space makes no more sense than establishing a separate force to manage the nation s strategic nuclear capability 62 as house armed services committee chairman adam smith pointed out it is too expensive it creates more bureaucracy we don t want more people we want to figure out how to better emphasize space 63 congress should also eliminate the 7 billion that will go toward building the border wall not only is this unnecessary it is something that does not belong in the defense budget finally congress should cut back on the military branches unrealistic plans to increase their size for example the army wants to increase the size of its active force yet it missed its recruiting goals for a smaller force last year by almost 10 000 soldiers even after giving massive bonuses and lowering its standards 64 meanwhile the air force should delay adding new squadrons until it deals with its pilot shortage and the navy should cut back its goal of growing to 355 ships by 2034 this is unrealistic even with a 750 billion budget especially since the navy just had to spend 24 billion to buy three zumwalt class destroyers and has underestimated the cost of the columbia class nuclear armed submarines 65 these are just a few of the areas in which the pentagon can safely reduce its budget request these reductions would not undermine u s national security in fact they would enhance it by supporting necessary actions funding truly critical security programs and reducing the national debt conclusion as with president trump s fy 2018 and fy 2019 defense budget proposals during his first two years in office his latest budget request puts more money into the pentagon than it can spend in a cost effective manner and attempts to pay for it by slashing other programs that contribute to u s national security while many military leaders will complain about any reduction in current or future levels of defense spending president trump should follow the examples of presidents truman eisenhower and reagan these men were willing to reduce defense spending not only to fund other national security programs but also to keep the federal budget deficit under control about the author

xingqiang chairman of adama s board of directors said adama continues to prove its ability to deliver strong levels of sales and profit overcoming the challenging conditions in the market this demonstrates the strength of the company s diversified and differentiated portfolio and its global commercial footprint this start to the year positions adama well to capitalize on its unique set of opportunities to drive further growth chen lichtenstein president and ceo of adama added our resilient performance this quarter saw us overcome challenges that the industry is facing including difficult weather in north america and australia and tight supply conditions action of our china and global teams ensured that we were able to quickly resume operations at the old site in jingzhou mitigating the impact on supply going forward performance in context of market environment crop prices remain soft with continued uncertainty surrounding the us china trade tensions these relatively low commodity prices remain challenging for farmer incomes in most regions resulting in continued subdued demand for crop protection products severe winter conditions in north america have caused a significant delay in planting impacting crop protection application throughout the region the season is now commencing and the pace of temperature rise in the coming weeks will determine how much of the delay can still be captured the company continues to exercise restraint of its manufacturing and other operating costs to mitigate the impact of continued shortages in certain raw materials and intermediates the supply constrained environment mostly owing to increased environmental focus in china has seen procurement costs remain elevated compared to the first quarter of last year while also contributing to overall stronger pricing of the company s products in its end markets financial highlights revenues in the first quarter were 1 006 million slightly below last year s best ever increasing by 1 0 in constant currency terms this resilient performance was achieved despite the severe winter in north america and continued supply constraints globally adama delivered strong growth in latin america and brazil in india middle east and africa as well as high double digit growth in china excluding products of the jingzhou old site strong demand for adama s differentiated product portfolio facilitated price increases across all regions which more than offset the impact of softer currencies this overall robust momentum together with joiners bonide and anpon enabled the company to overcome the lack of product to fulfill demand due to several weeks of production disruption at the jingzhou old site as well as the harsh winter in north america and continued supply constraints gross profit in the quarter was 344 million gross margin of 34 2 compared to 352 million in the first quarter last year gross margin of 34 4 the company succeeded in maintaining a stable gross margin mostly due to the strong performance in many geographies including china excluding jingzhou products and significant price increases operating expenses total operating expenses were 218 million 21 6 of sales in the quarter compared to 217 million 21 2 of sales in the first quarter last year this reflects continued containment of overall expenses while recording an 11 million charge for the idleness of the jingzhou old site which now gradually resumes operation and adding of joiners bonide and anpon sales and marketing expenses in the quarter were 164 million 16 3 of sales compared to 162 million 15 8 of sales in the first quarter last year the moderate increase reflects the inclusion of expenses of joiners general and administrative expenses in the quarter were 32 million 3 2 of sales compared to 38 million 3 7 of sales in the first quarter last year r d expenses in the quarter were 14 million 1 4 of sales compared to 13 million 1 2 of sales in the first quarter last year other operating expenses net include the 11 million impact of idle production expenses due to the suspension of production at the jingzhou old site operating income in the quarter was 127 million 12 6 of sales compared to 136 million 13 3 of sales in the first quarter last year ebitda in the quarter was 187 million compared to 190 million in the first quarter last year with the ebitda margin of 18 6 in line with first quarter last year financial expenses and investment income total net financial expenses and investment income in the quarter were 37 million compared to 34 million in the first quarter last year this reflects somewhat higher debt levels as well as the adoption of a new accounting standard leading to the capitalization of operating leases tax expenses net tax expenses were 9 million in the quarter compared to 18 million in the first quarter last year the lower expenses were due to lower taxable income generated at the jingzhou site as well as seasonally lower locally recorded pre tax income in brazil net income in the quarter was 80 million 8 0 of sales compared to 84 million 8 2 of sales achieved in the first quarter last year working capital at march 31 2019 was 2 082 million higher by 325 million compared to the same point last year the higher level reflects higher trade receivables resulting from the company s strong growth in q4 2018 inventory build up at higher procurement costs to prepare for the expected growth in 2019 and mitigate supply shortages the delayed season in north america and additions of joiners working capital cash flow operating cash flow of 191 million was consumed in the quarter compared to 34 million consumed in the corresponding period last year reflecting the higher working capital net cash used in investing activities was 159 million in the quarter compared to a cash inflow of 7 million in the first quarter last year with the higher 2019 level also reflecting the acquisition of bonide and the lower 2018 level affected by the one time proceeds from the divestiture of several products in connection with the approval by the eu commission of the acquisition of syngenta by chemchina last year and payment of a lesser net amount for the transfer of a similar portfolio of products investments in fixed assets net of investment grants amounted to 23 million in the quarter compared to 27 million in the first quarter last year free cash flow of 355 million was consumed in the first quarter compared to 31 million consumed in the first quarter last year noting the exceptionally lower level in 2018 due to the receipt of an approximately 379 million one time cash inflow from the divestiture of products in europe in connection with the acquisition of syngenta by chemchina last year and the lower cash amount paid for the similar portfolio of products transferred to the company leverage balance sheet net debt at the end of the quarter was 875 million compared to net debt of 513 million as of march 31 2018 reflecting mostly the sum of the acquisition payment for bonide assumption of acquired anpon s debt and the dividend paid in 2018 jingzhou old site the jingzhou old site is gradually resuming operation following its connection via pipeline to the state of the art wastewater treatment facility installed at the new and already operational site as a consequence of the disruption the company lacked sufficient product to fulfill first quarter demand and incurred approximately 11 million of additional idleness cost reflected in operating expenses the impact of the suspension is expected to

combined reporting for q3 2017 that chemchina previously was incurring in respect of its acquisition of solutions in 2011 this amortization is done in a linear manner on a quarterly basis most of which will be completed and removed in the second half of 2020 one time capital gain from divestment of registrations due to 2017 chemchina syngenta transaction in the first quarter of 2018 the company earned a one time profit on the divestment of crop protection products in connection with the approval by the eu commission of the acquisition of syngenta by chemchina this one time profit is excluded from the adjusted financial results due to its one time nature while the related tax expense is also adjusted for amortization of transfer assets received and written up due to 2017 chemchina syngenta transaction non cash the proceeds from the divestment of crop protection products in connection with the approval by the eu commission of the acquisition of syngenta by chemchina net of taxes and transaction expenses were paid to syngenta in return for the transfer of a portfolio of products in europe of similar nature and economic value since the products acquired from syngenta are of the same nature and with the same net economic value as those divested and since the company excludes the one time gain that it made on the divested products the additional amortization charge incurred due to the written up of the acquired assets is also excluded to present a consistent view of divestment and transfer transactions which had no net impact on the underlying economic performance of the company see note 2 reinstatement of amortization expenses related to the divestment non cash reinstatement of amortization expenses due to classification of to be divested european registrations as held for sale related to 2017 chemchina acquisition of syngenta accelerated depreciation due to relocation non cash production assets located in the old production sites in jingzhou and huai an will be relocated to the new sites in the coming years since some of the older production assets may not be able to be relocated some of these assets which are no longer operational are being written off or impaired while for others their economic life has been shortened and therefore will be depreciated over a shorter period since these are older assets that were built many years ago and will be replaced by newer production facilities at the new sites and since the ongoing operations of the business will not be impacted thereby the company adjusts for the impact of the accelerated depreciation of these assets non core assets closure non cash one time charge due to closure of peripheral non material assets long term incentive classified on an equity settled basis non cash the company granted its employees who are mainly non chinese residents a long term incentive lti in the form of phantom options due to the complexity of granting chinese listed equity settled options to non chinese employees as such the company records an expense or recognizes income depending on the fluctuation in the company s share price even though the company will not incur any cash impact prior to exercise of the phantom options to neutralize the impact of such share price movements on the measurement of the company s performance and expected employee compensation in the company s adjusted financial performance the lti is presented on an equity settled basis in accordance with the value of the plan at the grant date amortization of acquisition ppa non cash related to the amortization of non cash intangible assets created as part of acquisitions in addition to the full reflection of the purchase price paid in the company s net debt has no impact on the ongoing performance of the companies acquired sanonda adama combination transaction one time stamp tax one time stamp tax expense incurred related to the combination revaluation of non cash adjustment related to non controlling interest relates to put options issued to non controlling interests as part of historical business combinations which took place before january 1 2010 the put options are presented as a liability at the present value of the future exercise price the revaluation of these put options in solutions is recognized under ifrs to goodwill but due to the acquisition of solutions by the company in 2017 which is treated from an accounting perspective as a business combination under common control such revaluation is recorded as a profit or loss item in the financial reports of the company the revaluations of such put options have no bearing on the ongoing performance of the company and are therefore adjusted for exchange rate data for the company s principal functional currencies march 31

overview restrictions are there any restrictions on the establishment of a business entity by a foreign licensor or a joint venture involving a foreign licensor and are there any restrictions against a foreign licensor entering into a licence agreement without establishing a subsidiary or branch office whether or not any such restrictions exist is there any filing or regulatory review process required before a foreign licensor can establish a business entity or joint venture in your jurisdiction a licensor who intends to enter into a licence agreement under swiss law can do so without establishing a subsidiary or branch office in switzerland however there are no particular restrictions on the establishment of a business entity or a joint venture by foreign licensors in switzerland and no filing or regulatory review process applies kinds of licences forms of licence arrangement identify the different forms of licence arrangements that exist in your jurisdiction it is commonly understood that only intellectual property rights ipr can form the subject matter of a typical licence agreement as such distinctions are primarily made between patent licences including rights to supplementary protection certificates software or other copyright licences trademark licences design right licences and licences regarding topographies of semiconductor products when know how and celebrity or personality features form the subject matter of a licence agreement the licence is referred to as untypical licence or mixed licence if the licence arrangement also encompasses ipr strictly speaking franchise agreements are not qualified as a type of licence arrangement but rather as a sales and distribution systems with a licensing component with respect to the products brands or technologies that are marketed with regard to the scope of licence arrangements a distinction is made between exclusive sole and non exclusive licences exclusive licences confer all rights in the subject matter of the licence to the licensee with sole licences the licensor retains the right to use the subject matter of the licence while undertaking not to grant licences to any third parties in a non exclusive licensing setup the licensor may grant a limited or unlimited number of additional licences with respect to the same subject matter and the licensee s rights are more limited eg no standing to sue and no right to grant sub licences finally a distinction can be made between licences freely negotiated between the parties and compulsory licences compulsory licences are primarily known in the patent and copyright field law affecting international licensing creation of international licensing relationship does legislation directly govern the creation or otherwise regulate the terms of an international licensing relationship describe any such requirements under swiss law licensing agreements are innominate contracts or more precisely sui generis contracts for which no comprehensive set of specific rules exist in statutory law the intellectual property laws provide rules for certain aspects of licence agreements such as the rights of joint owners the right of exclusive licensees to sue or the registration of licence agreements in the ipr registries for other aspects the general provisions of contract law are applicable in addition to certain rules of lease rental purchase agreements or of property law that may be applied by analogy the rules on simple partnerships may play a role in licence arrangements that have company like features generally speaking the parties to a licensing arrangement are free to negotiate all aspects of a licence agreement where they have not stipulated specific rules the hypothetical intention of the parties must be determined in the first place and only in the second place is the above mentioned legislation applied either directly or by analogy the parties freedom to contract is only limited by few mandatory provisions of general contract law see questions 30 and 31 and by competition law see questions 26 and 27 under very specific circumstances mandatory provisions of agency law could also be applicable by analogy see question 31 pre contractual disclosure what pre contractual disclosure must a licensor make to prospective licensees are there any requirements to register a grant of international licensing rights with authorities in your jurisdiction under swiss law there are no specific pre contractual disclosure obligations that must be respected by the licensor however the general obligation of fair dealing and good faith see question 5 requires each party to disclose information that might influence the decision of the other party to enter into the contract or to enter into it in certain terms the federal supreme court has decided that a disclosure obligation exists if the licensor is aware of a concrete and serious risk that the licensed rights be nullified or not granted and that the possibility to use such rights be considerably impacted furthermore if the licensee has been induced to enter into a licence agreement by fraud of the licensor it is not bound by such an agreement generally speaking there is no obligation to register international licensing rights with swiss authorities with one exception see below however the parties have the possibility to register the licence in the respective intellectual property registries which may have certain advantages for the licensee in particular a registered licence can also be enforced against any subsequent buyers of the licensed ipr as an exception licences on collective marks need to be registered to be valid registration are there any statutorily or court imposed implicit obligations in your jurisdiction that may affect an international licensing relationship such as good faith or fair dealing obligations the obligation to act reasonably in the exercise of rights or requiring good cause for termination or non renewal the principle of good faith and fair dealing is a fundamental principle of swiss law it is expressly enacted in article 2 of the swiss civil code cc which states that every person is bound to exercise his rights and fulfil his obligations according to the principles of good faith this rule has become a general principle of law and plays an essential role in the interpretation and completion of contracts the fair dealing obligation already applies to the pre contractual stage where non compliance with such a principle can result in liability under the principle of culpa in contrahendo see question 4 with respect to pre contractual disclosure obligations as regards termination and non renewal of licence agreements the principle of good faith can for instance be invoked when the termination occurs at an improper time that causes particular harm to the other party without cause contrariwise it appears contrary to swiss legal principles to force a party to actively renew an agreement because of good faith considerations intellectual property issues paris convention is your jurisdiction party to the paris convention for the protection of industrial property the patent cooperation treaty pct the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips switzerland is a party to all these international treaties contesting validity can the licensee be contractually prohibited from contesting the validity of a foreign licensor s intellectual property rights or registrations in your jurisdiction there is no statutory rule that prohibits the conclusion of non challenge clauses in licence agreements under swiss law pursuant to an older supreme court precedent a prohibition to challenge the licensed rights is allowed and can in some cases even be inferred from the circumstances of the case even if it is not explicitly contained in the agreement the majority of swiss scholars consider non challenge clauses to be fundamentally valid under swiss competition law pursuant to a more recent doctrine however such clauses can be potentially problematic and prohibited as a matter of competition law invalidity or expiry what is the effect of the invalidity or expiry of registration of an intellectual property right on a related licence agreement in your jurisdiction if the licence remains in effect can royalties continue to be levied if the licence does not remain in effect can the licensee freely compete the expiry or invalidity of an ipr leads to the termination of a licence agreement concerning such a right if the parties have not agreed otherwise the parties are allowed to agree otherwise and often do so in particular if several rights are licensed in the same agreement or if additional assets such as know how are licensed save for special circumstances the licensee is in principle not entitled to be refunded the royalties paid under the licence agreement prior to the underlying right being declared invalid or prior to the invalidity becoming apparent to any third party swiss courts consider that the appearance of the validity of the right has an economic value from which the licensee has benefited during the term of the agreement after the termination of the licence agreement the licensee can freely compete with the licensor unless the parties have agreed otherwise requirements specific to foreigners is an original registration or evidence of use in the jurisdiction of origin or any other requirements unique to foreigners necessary prior to the registration of intellectual property in your jurisdiction foreign applicants must designate an address for service in switzerland for the notification of any office actions and other communication from the relevant authorities there are however no requirements that are unique to foreigners with regard to the documents to be filed with the swiss federal institute for intellectual property fiip if the applicant for the registration of an ipr claims the priority of a foreign prior right article 4 of the paris convention for the protection of industrial property 1883 the applicant must file the original certificate of registration of the jurisdiction of origin with the fiip unregistered rights can unregistered trademarks or other intellectual property rights that are not registered be licensed in your jurisdiction yes unregistered ipr such as copyright can be licensed under swiss law unregistered signs know how and celebrity or personality features which are not considered to be ipr can also form the subject matter of licence agreements untypical licence agreements see question 2 security interests are there particular requirements in your jurisdiction to take a security interest in intellectual property under swiss law there are no form requirements for licence agreements licence agreements are valid even if concluded orally or tacitly licence agreements concerning patents trademarks designs and plant varieties can be entered into the respective registers the registration of the licence makes it opposable to third parties as explained in question 3 a pledge of ipr can only be validly entered into in writing the pledge can but does not need to be entered into the respective register however similarly to the registration of licences the registration makes the pledge opposable to third parties proceedings against third parties can a foreign owner or licensor of intellectual property institute proceedings against a third party for infringement in your jurisdiction without joining the licensee from your jurisdiction as a party to the proceedings can an intellectual property licensee in your jurisdiction institute proceedings against an infringer of the licensed intellectual property without the consent of the owner or licensor can the licensee be contractually prohibited from doing so the owner of an ipr can always institute proceedings against third parties for infringement without having to join the local licensee to the proceedings an exception to this rule applies only if the parties agreed otherwise in the licensing agreement in which case the ipr owner may be contractually prohibited to take action independently any person who holds an exclusive licence into a patent a trademark a design irrespective of whether it is entered into the register or copyright is entitled to institute infringement proceedings and request financial compensation resulting from the infringement provided that this is not expressly excluded by the licence agreement the exclusive licensee can be contractually prohibited from instituting infringement proceedings if this is explicitly mentioned in the licence agreement both exclusive and non exclusive licensees can join an action for damages filed by the rightsholder in order to claim their own loss or damages sub licensing can a trademark or service mark licensee in your jurisdiction sub license use of the mark to a third party if so does the right to sub license exist statutorily or must it be granted contractually if it exists statutorily can the licensee validly waive its right to sub license trademarks and service marks can be sub licensed under the conditions set out by the main licence agreement it is disputed among swiss legal scholars whether sub licences can be granted in the absence of explicit contractual provisions whether the licensee has the right to grant sub licences is therefore a matter of contractual interpretation in every specific case see question 3 it is thus advisable to include a corresponding section in the main licence agreement the majority of swiss scholars agree that non exclusive licences generally cannot be sub licensed without the licensor s prior consent the licensee can waive its right to sub license jointly owned intellectual property if intellectual property in your jurisdiction is jointly owned is each co owner free to deal with that intellectual property as it wishes without the consent of the other co owners are co owners of intellectual property rights able to change this position in a contract under swiss property law co ownership may either be what is called united ownership or ownership in common each owner in common has the right to the whole thing this means that the joint owners do not possess an undivided share in the ipr conversely united owners possess an undivided share in the right the traditional view is that the principles of property law also apply to ipr subject to any agreement to the contrary parties that engage in joint work such as joint r d projects are traditionally held to be joined in a simple partnership and as a result are held to be owners in common for copyrights this view has been confirmed by the federal supreme court for patents and trademarks no judgment has been issued yet however the swiss patent office issued a statement in early 2000 according to which there is a general presumption that subject to an agreement to the contrary co owners of a patent are held to be owners in common a dissenting view has emerged in literature more recently according to which the general principles of property law shall not be applicable to patent law in view of a special provision in the patent act this modern view advocates that where a patent is granted to two people subject to an agreement to the contrary the co owners are held to be united owners of the patent ie each person or entity owns an equal undivided share in the patent regardless of which notion of co ownership is applied the grant of licences always requires the consent of all co owners under swiss law contrariwise the assignment of a co owner s interest in the ipr is only possible under united ownership whereas owner s in common always need the other co owner s consent in any event the parties are free to agree on the type of co ownership they prefer and they can provide detailed rules on the exploitation of the corresponding ipr the above outlined default legal regime applies only if the relevant agreement does not provide specific rules or is unclear in this respect first to file is your jurisdiction a first to file or first to invent jurisdiction can a foreign licensor license the use of an invention subject to a patent application but in respect of which the patent has not been issued in your jurisdiction switzerland is a first to file jurisdiction both swiss and foreign licensors are allowed to license an invention subject to a patent application but in respect of which the patent has not been issued scope of patent protection can the following be protected by patents in your jurisdiction software business processes or methods living organisms software business processes or methods are in principle not patentable although software itself cannot be the subject matter of a patent patents can be granted for computer implemented inventions in addition software code is protected as a work under copyright law pursuant to the patent act the human body and its elements naturally occurring gene sequences and inventions whose exploitation is contrary to human dignity or that disregard the integrity of living organisms or that are in any other way contrary to public policy or morality are not patentable the patent act also explicitly excludes patents on plant varieties and animal varieties it also excludes essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals trade secrets and know how is there specific legislation in your jurisdiction that governs trade secrets or know how if so is there a legal definition of trade secrets or know how in either case how are trade secrets and know how treated by the courts trade secrets and know how are protected by general contract law the federal act against unfair competition uca and the swiss criminal code there is no statutory definition of trade secrets under swiss law pursuant to court precedents and scholarly writing trade secrets are defined as information that is not publicly available and actually kept secret by its owner in addition the owner has to have an interest in keeping the information from becoming publicly known trade secrets are not considered as exclusive rights by swiss courts the remedies under the uca include injunctions against the use of information obtained in breach of a confidentiality undertaking and damages for breach of confidentiality does the law allow a licensor to restrict disclosure or use of trade secrets and know how by the licensee or third parties in your jurisdiction both during and after the term of the licence agreement is there any distinction to be made with respect to improvements to which the licensee may have contributed the parties to a licence agreement can agree on restricting the use and the disclosure of the licensor s trade secrets both during and after the termination of the agreement there are no statutory rules on the ownership of improvements of know how made by the licensee in the absence of explicit contractual provisions the agreement must be interpreted see question 3 whereby such an interpretation should not lead to a result that is inconsistent with competition law see question 31 copyright what constitutes copyright in your jurisdiction and how can it be protected pursuant to the federal act on copyright ca copyrighted works are literary and artistic intellectual creations with an individual character irrespective of their value or purpose article 2 1 of the ca this includes in particular literary scientific and other linguistic works musical works and other acoustic works works of art in particular paintings sculptures and graphic works works with scientific or technical content such as drawings plans maps or three dimensional representations works of architecture works of applied art photographic cinematographic and other visual or audiovisual works and choreographic works and works of mime article 2 2 of the ca computer programs are also protected under copyright law article 2 3 of the ca the ca also protects derivative works in their own right derivative works are works that are based upon pre existing works whereby the individual character of the latter remains identifiable in particular translations and audiovisual or other adaptations of pre existing works article 3 of the ca the protection of the pre existing work is reserved that is to say the use of the derivative work is subject to the consent of the owner of the copyright into the pre existing work works are protected by copyright law as from their creation in other words it is neither necessary nor possible to register copyrighted works with a state authority software licensing perpetual software licences does the law in your jurisdiction recognise the validity of perpetual software licences if not or if it is not advisable for other reasons are there other means of addressing concerns relating to perpetual licences swiss contract law does not recognise perpetual agreements in principle that is to say all long term agreements can be terminated unilaterally without cause after a certain minimal duration even if this is not foreseen or explicitly excluded by the agreement the allowed minimal duration depends on the intensity of the mutual obligations of the parties in the individual case swiss authors and one trial court decision consider however that perpetual software licences can be treated like the sale of one copy of the software in particular if the licensor has relinquished control over the relevant copy the licensee has paid an initial one time licence fee with no further recurring payments and the amount of the fee corresponds to the economic value of the relevant copy thus the licensee of a perpetual licence can be considered as having obtained legal title to the underlying copy legal requirements are there any legal requirements to be complied with prior to granting software licences including import or export restrictions there are no general administrative restrictions to the granting of licences for software however pursuant to the federal act on the control of dual use goods and of specific military goods software that was designed or modified for military purposes as well as software that may be used both for civilian and military purposes is deemed to be goods within the sense of the statute and can be subject to import and export restrictions restrictions on users are there any legal restrictions in your jurisdiction with respect to the restrictions a licensor can put on users of its software in a licence agreement the predominant principle in licensing is freedom of contract in principle the parties can foresee all kinds of legal restrictions and they are only limited by mandatory provisions of law such as competition law and the exhaustion principle that limits the possibility to impose enforceable resale restrictions on third parties the copyright act contains a list of exceptions to copyright which enable certain specific uses of computer programs without the copyright holder s consent in particular the right to decode software to ensure interoperability with other computer programs and the right to create backup copies although there are no supreme court decisions on this topic lower courts and the majority of swiss scholars consider that these exceptions cannot be contracted around ie a contractual limitation or exclusion of a party s right to decode software for interoperability purposes or to create backup copies would be unenforceable as a general rule of swiss contract law contractual provisions that one party the licensee cannot expect in good faith to be part of the agreement must be explicitly referred to and cannot be included into the agreement by way of pre formulated general terms and conditions unusualness principle finally in agreements with consumers the use of pre formulated general conditions that foresee a significant and unjustified disproportion between the rights and obligations arising from the contract to the detriment of the consumer in violation of the rules of good faith are considered to constitute unfair competition royalties and other payments currency conversion and taxes relevant legislation is there any legislation that governs the nature amount or manner or frequency of payments of royalties or other fees or costs including interest on late payments in an international licensing relationship or require regulatory approval of the royalty rate or other fees or costs including interest on late payments payable by a licensee in your jurisdiction there is no legislation governing the nature amount manner or frequency of royalty payments or other fees or costs the parties are in principle free with respect to their financial arrangements likewise neither royalty rates nor other fees or costs require regulatory approval in switzerland however under specific circumstances certain restrictions on the parties commercial freedom may follow from the applicable competition laws this applies in the field of standard essential patents or where licensing arrangements are capable of unduly influencing the market prices of the products at stake eg if in cross licensing agreements between competitors very high royalties are agreed with the purpose of raising the market price the swiss code of obligations provides for dispositive rules on interest payable on late payments which are applicable to international licensing agreements if the parties have not stipulated otherwise pursuant to these rules the interest rate for late payments in commercial arrangements corresponds to the applicable bank discount rate but is at least 5 per cent restrictions are there any restrictions on transfer and remittance of currency in your jurisdiction are there are any associated regulatory reporting requirements there are no restrictions on transfer and remittance of currency in switzerland switzerland s anti money laundering law newly imposes certain identification and documentation requirements when cash payments in a total amount of more than 100 000 swiss francs are made such requirements do not apply when money is transferred via a financial intermediary taxation of foreign licensor in what circumstances may a foreign licensor be taxed on its income in your jurisdiction only licensors incorporated or with a permanent establishment in switzerland in the case of companies or who have their place of residence in switzerland in the case of natural persons may be subject to income taxation in switzerland if these tax residency conditions are not met or if licence payments are not made to the swiss branch but to a foreign entity of the licensor licensing income to such foreign licensor is not taxed in switzerland even if such licensing income is generated in or from switzerland as a consequence no double taxation issues arise in such circumstances in switzerland there are no withholding taxes on royalties or other licensing payments made by licensees this applies regardless of whether the licensor is based in switzerland or abroad competition law issues restrictions on trade are practices that potentially restrict trade prohibited or otherwise regulated in your jurisdiction according to article 3 2 of the federal cartel act the act shall not apply to effects on competition resulting exclusively from the legislation concerning intellectual property except that import restrictions based on the legislation regarding intellectual property shall be subject to the cartel act while the exact effects of this provision are unclear the swiss competition commission backed up by the modern legal doctrine advocates that such a provision shall be interpreted restrictively licensing agreements are generally deemed to be subject to the general competition law rules the cartel act regulates binding and non binding arrangements including gentleman s agreements and concerted practices that have as their object or effect the restriction of competition in switzerland such arrangements are only prohibited if they eliminate competition or appreciably restrict competition without being justified on grounds of economic efficiency if the market share of any party to the agreement does not exceed 15 per cent vertical agreements are assumed not to have an appreciable effect on the market de minimis clause unless they include any of the following price fixing restrictions on where or to whom a buyer can sell restrictions on sales to the final consumer within a selective distribution system or cross sales among members of the same selective distribution system and restrictions preventing suppliers from selling components or spare parts to customers other than the distributors designated in the agreement there are no specific rules on licensing arrangements in swiss competition law generally speaking the guidelines of the european commission on technology transfer agreements while not directly applicable or binding in switzerland have a certain weight in the assessment of potentially restricting licensing practices and the boundaries set therein should therefore also be respected in agreements that have an impact on the swiss market furthermore the abuse of a dominant position is prohibited exclusive cross licence agreements between competing entities may result in a combined dominance which in the case of abuse could be considered a breach of competition law beneath the federal cartel act the swiss federal act against unfair competition can also be relevant with respect to anticompetitive practices although it applies a fair dealing standard rather than a market restriction approach for instance predatory pricing and refusal to deal or supply may be abusive under the cartel act as abuse of a dominant position or constitute a violation of unfair competition law under specific circumstances or both legal restrictions are there any legal restrictions in respect of the following provisions in licence agreements duration exclusivity internet sales prohibitions non competition restrictions and grant back provisions the duration of licence agreements is not restricted in a general manner and there is no strict prohibition on continuing a licence arrangement after expiration of the licensed rights licences for remuneration can be justified under competition law as long as either the relevant ipr exist or valuable know how is shared under certain circumstances a licence agreement can even continue for a certain time after expiration of the relevant rights for instance if the exclusive licensee continues to benefit from a head start thanks to the fact that he or she was granted a licence before competitors could step in however there are limitations to the possibility to stipulate perpetual obligations under swiss law article 27 of the cc see question 22 exclusive licences are generally permissible except for exclusivity in customer allocation which is a hardcore restriction exclusive cross licensing arrangements between direct competitors may result in a collective dominant position with increased abuse potential internet sales platforms are principally qualified as passive sales measures unless the website specifically targets customers in an individual territory active sale passive sales restrictions are considered hardcore restrictions of competition likewise constraints having a similar effect such as technical blocking measures rerouting or currency restrictions are also unlawful there are no directly applicable rules on non competition restrictions generally speaking non compete obligations are accepted in licence agreements however in line with the practice on general vertical restraints the duration of such non compete obligations should usually not exceed five years or one year after the termination of the agreement likewise there are no specific rules of swiss competition law and no relevant practice on grant back provisions such grant back provisions will be scrutinised on a case by case basis if the relevant market thresholds are met whereby exclusive grant back provisions have a higher potential of restricting competition than non exclusive obligations and should therefore not be included in licence agreements to avoid competition law issues ip related court rulings have courts in your jurisdiction held that certain uses or abuses of intellectual property rights have been anticompetitive there is no case law of swiss authorities in this respect see questions 30 and 31 for some guidance on the assessment of the anticompetitiveness of such uses indemnification disclaimers of liability damages and limitation of damages indemnification provisions are indemnification provisions commonly used in your jurisdiction and if so are they generally enforceable is insurance coverage for the protection of a foreign licensor available in support of an indemnification provision it is very common to include indemnification provisions in licensing agreements governed by swiss law such indemnification provisions are generally enforceable insurance coverage for the protection of a foreign licensor may be available in support of an indemnification provision waivers and limitations can the parties contractually agree to waive or limit certain types of damages are disclaimers and limitations of liability generally enforceable what are the exceptions if any it is common practice to exclude or limit liability for certain categories of damages in particular consequential and indirect damages respectively or to limit the total amount of damages due under the licence agreement such liability disclaimers and limitations are generally enforceable with an important exception any agreement purporting to exclude liability in advance for damages caused with unlawful intent or by gross negligence is void because of mandatory swiss contract law in addition disclaimers and limitations of liability for damages following from personal injury or death are considered not to be enforceable termination right to terminate does the law impose conditions on or otherwise limit the right to terminate or not to renew an international licensing relationship or require the payment of an indemnity or other form of compensation upon termination or non renewal more specifically have courts in your jurisdiction extended to licensing relationships the application of commercial agency laws that contain such rights or remedies or provide such indemnities the parties are free to terminate the licence in accordance with the contractual terms in this context it is however important to note that while swiss law does not impose conditions or limit the right to terminate or not to renew a licensing relationship it provides for a mandatory possibility to terminate any long term contract prematurely for important reasons such important reasons require grounds that would render the continuation of the contract unacceptable and unreasonable in general the threshold for an important reason is high generally speaking under swiss law no indemnity or other form of compensation is due upon termination or non renewal of a licence agreement however in very specific cases agency law which provides for a mandatory compensation under certain circumstances article 418u of the swiss code of obligations may be applicable by analogy if the factual and economic circumstances of the licensing setup are comparable to an agency setup namely if the licensee is integrated in the distribution organisation of the licensor and invests in the extension of the customer base without being able to retain such customers upon termination of the agreement the federal supreme court recently ruled that these conditions were fulfilled in a case involving an exclusive distribution agreement in an older judgment it had generally denied the applicability of the agency rules on exclusive distribution agreements it has not yet been decided whether article 418u of the swiss code of obligations may also be applicable to franchise agreements but in view of the supreme court s recent judgment it appears likely that the compensation requirement may also be extended to franchising setups on a case by case basis impact of termination what is the impact of the termination or expiration of a licence agreement on any sub licence granted by the licensee in the absence of any contractual provision addressing this issue would a contractual provision addressing this issue be enforceable in either case as a result of the termination or expiration of a licence agreement the performance of any sub licence granted by the licensee becomes impossible as a result the sub licensee can claim damages for non performance from the sub licensor ie licensee if the sub licence agreement is conditional upon the main licence agreement it automatically ends upon termination or expiration of such a main licence a contractual provision in the sub licence agreement alone would be insufficient to address this issue and would have no effect on the main licensor the parties can however validly agree in the main licence agreement that the licensor acknowledges the validity of any sub licences validly granted by the licensee even after expiration or termination of the main licence agreement in such a case the sub licensee can rely upon this provision of the main licence agreement as a defence against the licensor such provisions should be drafted with caution and indicate whether the sub licences remain valid in all cases eg including termination for material breach by the licensee or whether they remain valid only upon termination at will or expiration by one of the parties the parties can also agree in the main licence agreement that all sub licence agreements in force at the time of the termination or expiration of the main licence agreement are assigned to the licensor in the latter case the sub licensee s consent which can be given in the sub licence agreement is necessary for such assignment to be valid bankruptcy impact of licensee bankruptcy what is the impact of the bankruptcy of the licensee on the legal relationship with its licensor and any sub licence that the licensee may have granted can the licensor structure its international licence agreement to terminate it prior to the bankruptcy and remove the licensee s rights a licence agreement does not automatically end with the licensee s bankruptcy however the insolvency administrator of the licensee can decide whether or not it wants to continue to perform the licence agreement if he or she chooses not to perform the licence agreement the agreement is terminated article 211 of the federal act on debt enforcement and bankruptcy deba and the licensor s interest under the agreement will be transformed into a monetary claim article 211 of the deba if the administrator does not choose to continue the performance the licensor s claim against the estate is limited to what the licensor would be entitled to until the next possible date of termination or until the end of the fixed term of the contract article 211a of the deba the bankruptcy of the licensee may often be an important reason for the licensor to terminate the licence agreement even if such a termination possibility has not been explicitly stipulated in the agreement see question 35 in any event the parties are free to provide for a contractual termination right by the solvent party in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened upon the other party if the licence agreement is terminated upon bankruptcy of the licensee be it by the licensor or because the licensee s insolvency administrator chooses not to continue to perform the agreement any sub licence agreements will also come to an end see question 35 impact of licensor bankruptcy what is the impact of the bankruptcy of the licensor on the legal relationship with its licensee and any sub licence the licensee has granted are there any steps a licensee can take to protect its interest if the licensor becomes bankrupt similarly to what has been set out above at question 37 the licence agreement does not automatically terminate upon the licensor s bankruptcy the insolvency administrator can declare that it wants to continue or terminate the agreement if the performance of the agreement is not continued the licensee s interest under the agreement will be transformed into a monetary claim the amount of the claim is limited to what the licensee would be entitled to until the next possible date of termination or until the end of the fixed term of the contract the licence in registered rights can be registered with the appropriate public registers patent register trademark register and design register if the licence is registered it can be enforced against whoever acquires the right from the licensor s bankruptcy estate this possibility does not exist for the licence of unregistered rights eg copyright for unregistered copyrights in particular software licences it is advisable to inform the bankruptcy administrator proactively of the existence of the licence and request that the relevant copyrights shall not be sold without the encumbrance of the licence in addition such scenarios should be already envisaged when drafting the licence agreements where the right to use the source and object code for modifications and updates after bankruptcy of the licensor should be secured a software escrow is often advisable to ensure that the source and object codes are available after bankruptcy of the licensor in addition the licensee can request an additional security interest into the ipr such as a pledge or agree that in addition to or instead of the licence the licensee shall be granted a usufruct into the ipr a usufruct in contrast to a licence provides an erga omnes position which can be opposed to third parties including in the bankruptcy of the licensor governing law and dispute resolution restrictions on governing law are there any restrictions on an international licensing arrangement being governed by the laws of another jurisdiction chosen by the parties under swiss law the parties to an international licensing arrangement are free to choose the governing law the federal statute on international private law imposes very few limitations to the parties freedom of choice the mandatory provisions of swiss law that by reason of their special aim are applicable regardless of the law agreed upon by the parties remain applicable regardless of the parties choice of law this applies in particular with respect to swiss competition law which is applicable if the licence agreement has effects in switzerland and the application of provisions of foreign law is excluded if such application leads to a result that is incompatible with swiss public policy which will seldom be the case in a licensing context contractual agreement to arbitration can the parties contractually agree to arbitration of their disputes instead of resorting to the courts of your jurisdiction if so must the arbitration proceedings be conducted in your jurisdiction or can they be held in another the parties can contractually agree to arbitration in any jurisdiction and under any arbitration rules international licensing disputes under swiss law are mostly adjudicated under the international chamber of commerce rules of arbitration or the swiss rules of international arbitration but there is no limitation as to the applicable rules set and adjudicating body respectively zurich and geneva are popular choices as the seat for the arbitration international arbitration awards rendered in switzerland can be challenged before the federal supreme court as sole instance if the parties have not validly opted out of the setting aside procedure statistics show a very arbitration friendly stance and efficient decision making by the federal supreme court to date the question whether class action arbitration is allowed under swiss law remains untested in swiss courts equally the question of whether a contractual waiver of class action arbitration would be enforceable is unknown in any event nothing in swiss statutory law explicitly precludes class action arbitration but such proceedings might be invalidated for due process concerns and for a lack of equal treatment of the parties in addition the award may not be enforceable against or on behalf of all class members enforceability would a court judgment or arbitral award from another jurisdiction be enforceable in your jurisdiction is your jurisdiction party to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards a distinction must be drawn with respect to foreign judgments and arbitral awards rendered in other jurisdictions court judgments switzerland is a party to a number of bilateral and multilateral treaties governing the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments judgments rendered by courts of eu member states as well as of norway and iceland are recognised and enforced under the rules of the lugano convention of 30 october 2007 under the convention decisions that are enforceable in their country of origin are also recognised and enforceable in switzerland with very few exceptions a swiss court will recognise such decision incidentally without reviewing the competence of the deciding court or the merits of the foreign decision the lugano convention does not limit the remedies that can be enforced therefore any remedy ordered by a court of a convention member state can be enforced in switzerland except where a remedy would be in manifest contradiction to swiss public order notably not only final judgments but also preliminary injunctions except for ex parte injunctions are in principle enforceable under the lugano convention although their enforcement may raise complex issues in practice switzerland is also a party to a number of bilateral treaties on recognition and enforcement in civil and commercial matters where there are no applicable treaties the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is governed by the swiss private international law act pila according to the pila a foreign court decision is recognised if it has been rendered by a competent foreign authority it is final and it complies with fundamental material and procedural legal standards as defined by the pila if these conditions are met a swiss court will recognise the decision incidentally without further reviewing the merits of the decision the prevailing view is that under the pila a judgment must be final to be enforceable which excludes the enforceability of foreign preliminary injunctions in switzerland except where rendered by a member state of the lugano convention arbitral awards switzerland is a party to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 new york convention the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in switzerland is governed by the rules of the new york convention this applies regardless of the place where an arbitral award was rendered it is noteworthy that disputes regarding the validity of licensed intellectual property are also arbitrable in switzerland hence an arbitral award declaring a registered ipr invalid will be recognised and enforced by the swiss institute for intellectual property in the same manner as a judgment or order to the same effect injunctive relief is injunctive relief available in your jurisdiction may it be waived contractually if so what conditions must be met for a contractual waiver to be enforceable may the parties waive their entitlement to claim specific categories of damages in an arbitration clause injunctive relief is available in switzerland other than in some other jurisdictions public policy considerations are not taken into account when determining whether an injunction may be granted rather if the breach of the licence agreement can be remedied by an injunction and the claimant actually requests an injunction the court has no judicial discretion to deny the grant of such an injunction there are no exemptions for particular subject matter such as pharmaceuticals or particular claimants such as non practising entities however the parties to a licence agreement are free to contractually waive the right to request injunctions to remedy a breach of the licence agreement in this case the waiver should be explicit and limited in time eg for the duration of the agreement likewise it is common practice to exclude liability for certain categories of damages in particular consequential and indirect damages respectively or to limit the total amount of damages due under the licence agreement however an important limitation applies with respect to damages caused with unlawful intent or by gross negligence where any agreement purporting to exclude liability in advance is void because of mandatory swiss law see questions 29 and 30

hundreds of haitians took to the streets friday to demand the release of a final audit report accusing haiti s political class of embezzling or misusing well over a billion dollars received through venezuela s discounted petrocaribe oil alliance program mare yo they chanted in downtown port au prince haitian creole for handcuff them the resistance underway in haiti started as modern day revolutions do on twitter it was august 2018 and tensions were still high after the haitian government announced then retracted a plan to raise the price of fuel by as much as 51 gilbert mirambeau jr a 35 year old haitian filmmaker and writer tweeted a photo of himself blindfolded holding a handwritten cardboard sign reading kot kòb petwo karibe a or where is the petrocaribe money a demonstrator

going and spending the money that was supposed to help us related a family split between the us and haiti dreads looming loss of legal status the blindfold was meant to evoke a kidnapping victim a metaphor mirambeau said for the people of haiti being held hostage by their corrupt government as well as the greek goddess themis who raises the scales of justice with her eyes covered to ensure justice is meted out objectively within two days of his tweet the hashtag kotkòbpetwokaribea exploded as thousands of haitians tweeted photos of themselves holding the same sign in some port au prince neighborhoods it was spray painted onto every street corner and billboard the tweets and street protests spread to the haitian diaspora in boston miami montreal and paris and kotkòbpetwokaribea became the rallying cry for a new movement unlike any other in haitian history one led by youth armed with smartphones who are wielding social media to speak out against impunity and demand transparency from political leaders accustomed to obscuring their corruption behind haiti s dysfunctional institutions they call themselves the petrochallengers the core group is comprised of 20 and 30 somethings who

the haiti we want members of the petrochallenger movement meet once a week to discuss the current political situation of the country and define their strategy as activists in the movement credit cristina baussan the world on a tuesday afternoon last month a dozen petrochallengers gathered for their weekly meeting in a colorful art filled cafe near central port au prince known for attracting activists expats and an lgbtq crowd it s become the de facto headquarters for their movement édith piaf s la vie en rose wafted across their back porch meeting space as attendees filed in several of them dressed in business attire from their day jobs the table was soon littered with laptops smartphones and bottles of prestige haiti s national beer emmanuela douyon one of the activists in the petrochallenger movement holds up her phone showcasing one of her tweets which reads if we continue like this we will get to the point where 8 million people will have nothing left to lose and we will be the ones to lose then credit cristina baussan the world among them was emmanuela douyon a 29 year old researcher who is starting her own think tank focused on economic development she was mobilized by mirambeau s twitter challenge and has delayed the launch of her organization to devote more time to petrochallenge activism uprisings in haiti tend to have the effect of simply ousting one president or prime minister and replacing him with another she explained but now the petrocaribe challenge is not something against a president it s not against a dictatorship it s people asking for accountability and this is a huge problem in haiti but it s been a long time since we have had so many people coming together to ask for it i think this is really new emmanuela douyon petrochallenger but now the petrocaribe challenge is not something against a president it s not against a dictatorship she said it s people asking for accountability and this is a huge problem in haiti but it s been a long time since we have had so many people coming together to ask for it i think this is really new the petrochallenge movement is comprised of two groups nou pap dòmi or we keep our eyes open which is focused on government accountability in the short term and ayiti nou vle a or the haiti we want a group that encourages ordinary citizens to get involved in shaping haiti s long term future by encouraging civic engagement online and offline both groups started in the wake of mirambeau s tweet pascale solages one of the activists in the petrochallengers movement sits inside the restaurant where she often meets with other activists credit cristina baussan the world for inspiration the petrochallengers have looked to other youth led movements around the world that used social media such as the arab spring occupy wall street and y en a marre a senegalese movement created by young rappers and journalists to protest ineffective government and register youth to vote they ve also looked to france s yellow vest protests which president emmanuel macron responded to just last week social media is a key component of the petrochallenge movement said gaëlle bien aimé 31 a haitian women s rights activist comedian and petrochallenger for example people have tweeted photos of vacant lots and skeletal structures where some of the nearly 2 billion in petrocaribe funds were supposed to have been spent it s not the first time money has disappeared like this or been wasted but this is one of the biggest financial scandals in a time when information is not hidden everything is posted on whatsapp twitter and other social media gaëlle bien aimé haitian women s rights activist and comedian it s not the first time money has disappeared like this or been wasted she said but this is one of the biggest financial scandals in a time when information is not hidden everything is posted on whatsapp twitter and other social media this will make people believe in haiti again the petrochallengers have pledged to keep protesting until those named in the report are put on trial for the money they stole they ve said they ll keep going until they can vote in a new government one that answers to the haitian people and they want the trial to take place in haiti to be overseen by the haitian judiciary i think if we have the petrocaribe trial and some really really really powerful people go to prison or pay for what they did then this will show that in haiti we too can fight corruption douyon said i think it will show us for the younger generation this is what we can do if we reach this people will start believing that we can create jobs we can develop haiti if we have at least the trial this will make people believe in haiti again she added because for now no one does the difficulty however will be ensuring their activism leads to accountability the petrochallenge movement is not aligned with any political party and that s by design they want it to be as inclusive as possible some observers say that could be their downfall passersby walk in front of a wall tagged with graffiti denouncing the misuse of the petrocaribe funds by the haitian government credit cristina baussan the world this movement is interesting because they tend to be neutral in terms of politics said robert fatton a haiti analyst and politics professor at the university of virginia in one way that gives them strength but it also gives them a rather weak hand because the people who are accused have more power than the people who are accusing them we ll see what will happen whether political parties in the opposition are going to hijack the movement for their political purposes politicians are already tapping into the discontent in february the democratic and popular sector an alliance of haitian opposition groups that want to oust the president promoted protests that turned violent and lasted 10 days bringing the country to a standstill twenty six people died according to the inter american commission on human rights private businesses were set on fire and looted and though the protests drew from the same deep well of anger beneath the petrochallenge movement they weren t organized by the same groups of which mirambeau douyon and bien aimé are part a man holds a weapon next to burning barricades during anti government protests in port au prince haiti feb 17 2019 credit ivan alvarado reuters the petrochallengers insistence on staying out of politics may not be enough said jocelyn mccalla a longtime haitian human rights advocate based in new york where they are weakest is in believing that popular pressure alone is going to force the people the people implicated in the report as well as the people who have influence over the judicial system to act jocelyn mccalla haitian human rights advocate based in new york where they are weakest is in believing that popular pressure alone is going to force the people the people implicated in the report as well as the people who have influence over the judicial system to act he said they have to take one more step and that more that one more step is being more politically engaged in the petrochallengers view the pressure they ve exerted from outside politics has already brought about some change their biggest impact has been heightened awareness of how public funds are spent said jeffsky poincy a 32 year old economist and petrochallenger people didn t know what was happening in the public administration in haiti nor with the petrocaribe funds now they do he said now the government cannot take any action without taking into account petrocaribe in addition amid the demonstrations haitian lawmakers have forced out two prime ministers and their governments in the span of six months a new prime minister jean michel lapin took the job last month with a goal to quell disagreement among various political factions the next generation the scene at a haitian market in port au prince haiti credit cristina baussan the world haiti is a young country more than half the population of about 11 million is under 25 years old according to world bank figures more than 6 million people live below the poverty line of 2 41 per day they are plagued by a weakening local currency years of double digit inflation and widening inequality not only that access to clean drinking water has always been rare and power outages have grown more frequent in the past few months as petrocaribe woes have the country scrambling for ways to pay for fuel gang violence is on the rise then of course there s the corruption haiti ranks 161 out of 180 countries on transparency international s corruption perceptions index the country is sitting on top of a volcano of discontent so many issues are incredibly pressing to send your kid to school you can t do that anymore teachers have not been paid and the price of transportation has increased significantly it s impossible to sustain yourself it s really a very very desperate situation robert fatton a haiti analyst and politics professor university of virginia the country is sitting on top of a volcano of discontent said fatton the haiti analyst from the university of virginia so many issues are incredibly pressing to send your kid to school you can t do that anymore teachers have not been paid and the price of transportation has increased significantly it s impossible to sustain yourself it s really a very very desperate situation without basic public services and infrastructure let alone opportunities for social mobility many young people feel their futures have been stolen that s why the petrochallenge movement has exploded said james beltis a 36 year old sociologist and co founder of nou pap domi and its spokesperson the group organized friday s protest and others last fall for me it s a big historical moment because normally the haitian people are victims of political manipulation beltis said i feel i m participating in destroying a system that s existed for hundreds of years and turned haiti into a country of beggars and i m participating in the construction of a new haiti james beltis one of the activists in the petrochallenger movement holds up his phone showcasing one of his social media posts which reads during the 2018 2019 fiscal year we will have to pay 24 billion haitian gourdes in debt october 17th is everyone s concern credit cristina baussan the world the fight is personal for beltis he is the father of twins a boy and a girl his wife gave birth to them in the united states because of medical complications and his son adam resides permanently in an orlando florida medical facility because there s no hospital in haiti equipped to handle his life threatening respiratory issues the twins turned 4 last week and adam has never been to haiti i have to take out money every four to six months to travel to the us to see my child he could be here if the men in the government didn t steal the 4 billion that was there for development there would ve been a hospital here and this is not the case james beltis nou pap domi co founder i have to take out money every four to six months to travel to the us to see my child beltis said he could be here if the men in the government didn t steal the 4 billion that was there for development there would ve been a hospital here and this is not the case a wake up call the petrochallengers are the latest in a long line of haitian resistance movements haitian schoolchildren grow up learning how their ancestors led the world s first successful slave rebellion and founded a republic in 1804 its more recent history is marked by coups notably the overthrow of the duvalier papa doc and baby doc dictatorship in 1986 haiti has hardly experienced a quiet period since and the past three decades have seen frequent political interventions by the united states and united nations many of the elite families that dominated the economy during the duvalier era still dominate today that s why many haitians don t feel they re in control of their country s destiny moïse the current president was unpopular long before the petrocaribe scandal he took office in february 2017 after a contested election in which only 20 of the electorate voted many within the recent protests have called for his ouster the petrocaribe scandal had been simmering for years international and local watchdog groups long suspected the funds were being misused then two reports gave them proof an october 2017 report by a special commission of haiti s senate which covered the period from 2008 to 2016 then a january 2019 report by haiti s audit court a portrait of gilbert mirambeau jr whose tweet denouncing the misuse of the petrocaribe money inspired a social media movement against the current sociopolitical climate in haiti credit cristina baussan the world the muted initial reaction to the 2017 report shows how haitians have become numb to the depths of corruption it would be several more months until mirambeau tweeted and got people angry and prompted them into the streets people needed a wake up call mirambeau said the movement gave them that the reports contain hundreds of pages worth of public works projects that were paid for and never built they read like a laundry list of what could ve been said etzer emile a 33 year old economist and author of the book haiti has chosen to become a poor country the 20 lessons that prove it petrocaribe is the biggest chance we missed in the last 30 years in terms of opportunity to really do something for the country emile said if this money was used properly it could easily generate 5 6 7 growth for 10 years after friday s protest the petrochallengers are looking to mid may when the audit court said it will finally release the final chapter of its report it s expected to implicate many more powerful people that s exactly why the petrochallengers believe they must keep protesting to ensure it won t be buried asked whether she considers herself a revolutionary douyon laughed i m afraid of the word she said it s too big at least we are brave enough to say ok we want to do something and maybe after that they will call us revolutionary she said but for now let s say that we are citizens we re tired and we are trying to do something tania karas amy bracken and

durban with the expected petrol price increase of 56 cents a litre just days away debt stressed consumers are going to have to cut unnecessary expenses to the bone if they hope to get through the month without running out of cash while diesel is expected to remain flat dawie roodt chief economist at the efficient group said that this fourth increase in a row might not be the end of it and that further price hikes in the next few months were highly likely and could take the country beyond the historical high prices notched up in the recent past increased american sanctions against iran one of south africa s major suppliers of crude oil are definitely going to be a factor as will the rand dollar exchange rate and the outcome of the upcoming election said roodt he added if the rand continues to slide against the us dollar and a shortage of crude drives up prices the result could be too horrible to contemplate neil roets chief executive of one of south africa s largest debt counselling companies debt rescue said there was clear evidence that consumers were now resorting to credit just to put food on the table roets said in its most recent results pick n pay noted that its pick n pay store account now has 125 000 active customers an increase of 25 percent year on year while it is undoubtedly used for other items besides food one can safely assume that the main card expenditure was on food roets said that it was also painfully evident from the rapid growth of debt rescue that a growing number of consumers were falling behind in debt repayments and resorting to the process of legal debt review roet said aside from making life much more difficult for motorists it is also going to have a wider impact on consumers as the vast majority of goods in south africa are transported by road we are seeing daily records being set by the number of distressed consumers who are knocking on our door the be placed under debt review roets said the fuel levy alone had risen by more than 22 percent in the last three years and when the carbon tax kicked in later in the year this would cause a further spike in the price of all grades of fuel the outcome of the election could have a major impact on the fuel price as it could affect the exchange rate if parties to the left show significant gains this might spook foreign investors and we have seen before how domestic policy can impact on foreign direct investment said roodt we are going to adapt our lifestyle to adjust to tighter market conditions doing more with less said roets roets said that with gross consumer debt at around r1 73 trillion and the government s gross loan debt at r2 2 trillion in 2016 17 financial year it is clear that south africans are in for a very rough ride a major issue for the few months is going to be whether ratings agencies are going to further downgrade south africa s sovereign debt this could have a dramatic impact on the cost of state borrowing roets said that almost half of all consumers were three months or more behind in their repayments the major culprits are credit and store cards followed closely by unsecured debt the only measure of relief for consumers who are in over their heads is the legally binding system of debt review which allows deeply indebted consumers to repay their debts over a longer period of time in smaller instalments often at a discount lenders are sometimes willing to take a cut if it means they can avoid having to involve debt collectors or foreclosing on the fixed properties of debtors another major issue is going to be load shedding and whether a post election government is going to be able to keep the lights on given the mess that eskom is in this seems increasingly unlikely and all of us are going to feel the pain concluded roets

by etsubdink sileshi what has happened and what it means it has been a year and half since the national bank of ethiopia nbe devalued the currency etb by about 15 in october 2017 the then vice governor and chief economist of nbe yohannes ayalew said in recent years the real effective exchange rate of ethiopia has become stronger reducing our global competitiveness this is attributed to two factors one is the global economic slowdown which resulted in a decline of inflation in our main trading partners this makes ethiopian exports relatively expensive and the other factor is the strengthening of the usd this reduces the purchasing ability of non usd countries 1 the imf had been pushing for exchange rate and other policy reforms high level delegates from the fund held a meeting with ethiopian authorities two weeks prior to the devaluation decision according to the fund s view the birr is still over valued policies should address most of the birr s prior overvaluation while ongoing reforms to strengthen the business environment will help preserve competitiveness gains a more flexible exchange rate would help preserve competitiveness and foster export diversification and recommended eliminating exchange restrictions 2 why do countries adjust the price of their currencies how much big should this change be and how long does it take for the benefits to pay back how is ethiopia s external trade responding to the nbe s action will there be unintended consequences this article will take you through the answers to all these questions the devaluation of birr means that our exports become cheaper and imports dearer for an american consumer of ethiopian coffee 1 can buy more coffee now than before the birr price of coffee being the same on the other hand for an ethiopian here a barrel of oil is more expensive now than it was before needs more birr now given that the dollar price of oil is kept at the same level hence in the short run the quantity of exports and imports remains unchanged as purchase orders are set in advance however the price of exports declines while imports become expensive this increases trade deficits however as time goes on the price competitiveness of ethiopian exports attracts more consumers from abroad volume of exports rises for instance if brazil has a strong currency and ethiopia a weaker devalued one ethiopia s coffee of similar quality will be preferred to brazil s in the market increase in foreign produced items prices is expected to reduce demand for imports in the long run thus a rising volume of exports vis à vis a falling quantity of imports leads to trade balance the least it can do is to narrowing the trade deficit then the answer to the first question above is that devaluation helps achieve a favorable trade balance moreover in countries like ethiopia it helps solve the foreign currency shortage boosts reserves regarding the size of devaluation 15 it is not a random number central banks use tools like the law of one price or the purchasing power parity to identify if the price of an identical good is higher lower or equal with other countries the fertilizers pesticides herbicides and the time when the fruits of devaluation get reaped is devaluation of a currency always successful the answer is no only countries that have done their assignments well enjoy the benefits of weak currency plus a onetime devaluation and a successive ones have different results the world bank group gave ethiopia about seven recommendations back in 2014 almost all of the requests outlined there are key to achieving the targets of devaluation in ethiopia the points include increase value addition and branding of exports easing binding constraints like power supply credit and foreign exchange redressing bottlenecks in trade logistics establishing industrial zones revising burdensome business rules improving regulatory quality and ensuring real exchange rate competitiveness the very topic we are discussing 3 moreover responsiveness to the reduced prices of ethiopian exports export elasticity and that of increased costs of imports to ethiopia import elasticities play an important role on the effectiveness of devaluation according to what economists call marshall learner condition the absolute value of the sum of these elasticities should be greater than one if this criterion is met the trade imbalance vanishes in the long run how long is the long run a change in any policy will not have an automatic effect there is a period between an implementation of a policy and its outcomes output lag so for ethiopia to reap the benefits of devaluation it takes time for commercial contracts to be renegotiated quantities altered inventories destocked production lines expanded what the thermometer reads according to the quarterly bulletin of nbe q1 2019 total earnings from export fell by 7 4 percent compared to the same quarter of the previous year the export volume of oilseeds gold fruits vegetables flower live animals and electricity declined but those of coffee and pulses witnessed a rise the price of most of these items decreased while there was a rise for some conventional wisdom tells as quantity of exports should remain constant in the short run and rise then after the reductions in volume might have resulted from other factors like political instability on the import side nbe says in the first quarter of 2018 19 total merchandise imports are found to be 8 7 percent lower than a year ago the explanation given is slowdown in import values of capital consumer semi finished and miscellaneous goods this reduction in imports contributed to the narrowing of the trade deficits vis a vis the same period in the previous fiscal year4 can a side effect be worse than the original disease sometimes yes patients who walk in to hospitals may fall in bed if treatments go wrong a pill if taken inappropriately may hurt the other organ more than the initial case of the organ that it was intended to cure in the same token economic policy actions like devaluation might have dire consequence if measures including the above seven points are left unattended rising inflation due increase in cost of imports forex shortage if exports fail to generate hard currency deteriorating trade balance may follow offsetting the desired targets of nbe at this level it may be too early to clearly identify the blessings curses of the birr devaluation as the size of the mirror time increases and if it is kept well polished with rich data and proper tools of analysis the true image of the effect of this policy will be revealed indeed we will continue valuing the devaluation the writer can be reached at etsubdink08 gmail com
surging crude prices are posing another headwind for the world economy after us president donald trump s zero pledge on iran oil sales brent crude has risen about 33 per cent this year and is close to the highest in six months while higher prices owing to strong demand typically reflects a robust world economy a shock from constrained supply is a negative much will depend on how sustained the spike proves to be exporting nations will enjoy a boost to corporate and government revenues while consuming nations will bear the cost at the pump potentially fanning inflation and hurting demand ultimately there comes a point where higher prices may be damaging to everyone 1 what does it mean for global growth the impact will vary rising oil prices will hurt household income and spending and it could accelerate inflation as the world s biggest importer of oil china is vulnerable and many countries in europe also rely on imported energy seasonal effects will also have an impact with the northern hemisphere summer approaching consumers can switch energy sources and scale back usage a slowing world economy will also hurt demand and by extension keep a lid on prices 2 how can the world economy absorb oil at 100 for a sustained hit to growth economists say oil would need to hold above 100 it also depends on dollar strength or weakness given crude is priced in greenbacks analysis by oxford economics found that brent at 100 per barrel by the end of 2019 means the level of global gross domestic product would be 0 6 per cent lower than currently projected by the end of 2020 with inflation on average 0 7 percentage points higher we see increased risks of significantly higher oil prices oxford economists john payne and gabriel sterne wrote in a note in the short run it is likely the supply impact will be offset by higher production elsewhere but the market is tightening and all it would take is one more shock to supply and oil could reach 100 3 how will iran and mr trump affect the market an upending of global oil trade around the iran trump spat could continue to have a sizeable impact on financial markets as the affected supply is as much as 800 000 barrels per day uncertainties around availability have already whipsawed oil markets and the political sensitivities of these developments have other markets bracing for volatility mr trump has pledged to help alongside saudi arabia and the uae those needing to shift orders from iran to another supplier but us claims that its domestic supply can help offset the loss are a high bar to meet given that the daily american output for similar crude is about a quarter of iran s 4 who wins from higher oil prices emerging economies dominate the list of oil producing nations which is why they are affected more than developed ones the increase in revenues will help to repair budgets and current account deficits allowing governments to increase spending that will spur investment winners include saudi arabia russia norway nigeria and ecuador according to analysis by nomura 5 who loses those emerging economies nursing current account and fiscal deficits run the risk of large capital outflows and weaker currencies which in turn would spark inflation that in turn will force governments and central banks to weigh up their options raise interest rates even as growth slows or ride it out and risk capital flight nomura s losers list includes turkey ukraine and india 6 what does it mean for the the world s biggest economy while us oil producers try to take advantage of any sales boost from customers moving away from iran the broader us economy won t necessarily see benefits with oil price tags as high as 100 per barrel it would be a squeeze on american consumers forming the backbone of still steady economic growth prices at the petrol pump already have risen more than 7 per cent this month to 2 89 per gallon which could weigh on retail sales that jumped in march by the most since 2017 and if things go awry in global oil markets there is risk that political blame shifts back to the us for the sanctions which could mean backlash via investment or other channels that threaten economic stability 7 will it lead to higher inflation around the world because energy features prominently in consumer price gauges policymakers look to core indexes that remove volatile components if the run up in prices proves to be substantial and sustained those costs will filter through to transportation and utilities 8 what does it mean for central banks led by the federal reserve central banks around the world have taken a dovish tilt as the absence of inflation allows policymakers to shift their focus to slowing growth that is unlikely to quickly change the international monetary fund this month lowered its global growth forecast and said the world is in a delicate moment
use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions litigation court system what is the structure of the civil court system the belgian civil court system is modelled after the french napoleonic three tier system in which a judgment handed down by the lower court may be appealed to a higher court with respect both to questions of law and to questions of fact and the higher court s decision is subject to limited review by the supreme court this diagram does not include the criminal labour and administrative courts or the constitutional court justices of the peace there are 187 justices of the peace in belgium as a rule the justice of the peace has subject matter jurisdiction on all disputes where the amount of the claim is not in excess of 2 500 with the exception of a few disputes that are expressly reserved by law to other courts in addition the justice of the peace has special subject matter jurisdiction

of matters including but not limited to claims for an authorisation to enforce domestic and foreign arbitral awards as well as foreign judgments except in insolvency matters claims regarding personal status nationality paternity and maternity suits etc claims regarding expropriations for public purposes and claims regarding the application of tax laws claims regarding attachments garnishment orders etc are handled by a specific chamber within a court of first instance the court of attachments finally a court of first instance has appellate jurisdiction with respect to judgments handed down by the justices of the peace established in the court s district provided the value of the claim is in excess of 1 860 since 1 january 2016 entry into force of the main provisions of the law of 19 october 2015 reforming certain features of the belgian civil procedure cases before a court of first instance are handled by chambers composed of one judge chambers may exceptionally be composed of three judges if the complexity or interest of the case as well as specific circumstances so require some courts of first instance or of the enterprise for example in brussels or antwerp usually set up chambers that specialise in specific matters construction contracts property bankruptcy etc three judge chambers remain the norm before the labour courts and courts of the enterprise in which two lay judges sit with a professional judge courts of the enterprise formerly courts of commerce there are nine courts of the enterprise in belgium under the belgian judicial code a court of the enterprise has jurisdiction on all disputes between enterprises irrespective of the value of the claim being any person or legal entity pursuing an economic objective on a lasting basis provided the dispute concerns an act that was carried out in the pursuit of this objective but except when the dispute belongs to the exclusive jurisdiction of other courts in addition a court of the enterprise has special or exclusive jurisdiction on a wide variety of disputes including but not limited to disputes regarding corporations including disputes between shareholders claims involving insolvency proceedings and claims in relation to inland and sea shipping a court of the enterprise also has exclusive jurisdiction on all disputes between enterprises regarding intellectual property namely

with respect to the utilities market or decisions of bondholders or shareholders in public limited companies since january 2017 chambers specialising in regulated markets markets court have been created at the court of appeal of brussels the markets court consists of judges having at least 15 years of professional experience evidencing of a specific knowledge of economic and financial law or regulated markets the jurisdiction of the markets court covers the whole country supreme court the supreme court reviews judgments handed down by the lower courts provided all appeals have been exhausted thus it reviews judgments against which no appeal can be lodged namely when the value of the judgment is less than 1 860 before the justice of the peace or 2 500 before a court of the enterprise or a court of first instance and judgments handed down in appeal from the justice of the peace by a court of first instance as well as judgments handed down by the courts of appeal in civil and commercial matters appeals to the supreme court must be filed by one of the 20 lawyers admitted to practise at the supreme court the supreme court does not review the facts of the dispute but only whether the lower court has properly interpreted the law including treaties and binding supranational regulations and laws and whether it has complied with formal and procedural rules as belgian law provides that judgments must be reasoned and must respond to the parties arguments and exhibits the supreme court s review will extend to ensuring that the lower court s findings of facts are consistent and not contradictory in effect this review entails a limited review of the facts by the supreme court the supreme court does not actually settle the dispute but merely confirms the judgment under review or strikes it down and remands the dispute to another court at the same level of jurisdiction as the court whose judgment was cancelled following a legal amendment that entered into force on 3 august 2017 when the supreme court decides to strike down a lower court s decision it now has a discretionary power not to remand the dispute to another lower court the supreme court should use this power when it finds that there is nothing further to be decided in the dispute moreover if the supreme court decides to remand the dispute to a lower court the latter is now bound to comply with the supreme court s decision constitutional court the constitutional court has a dual function it rules on conflicts between the federal laws and the regional laws and it rules on the compatibility of these laws with the main provisions of the constitution or of international instruments including particularly the provisions that guarantee civil liberties and rights two types of claims can be submitted to the constitutional court an annulment claim can be filed against the laws passed by the federal regional or community legislatures within six months from the date of publication of the law in the official gazette or of a decision of the constitutional court on a preliminary question stating a violation of the above mentioned rules the annulment claim can be filed by the council of ministers and the governments of the regions and communities by the chairpersons of all legislative assemblies or by any natural or legal person who can show that it has a justifiable interest in pursuing the annulment of the law namely that it will be affected personally by the law in question courts may also sua sponte or upon the motion of one of the parties refer a preliminary question to the constitutional court when they are in doubt as to the compatibility of a law with the above mentioned rules council of state administrative section claims against the government and certain administrative bodies regarding the validity of certain decisions or actions taken by the administration eg a decision denying an export licence or adjudicating a public procurement are subject to the jurisdiction of the council of state the council of state has the authority to suspend and eventually annul the disputed decisions and actions these claims are brought forth before the council of state in accordance with the procedural rules set out in the laws on the council of state of 12 january 1973 amended by the laws of 6 and 19 january 2014 the council of state may award a compensation to indemnify the harm suffered because of the annulled decision or action compensation must also be sought from the civil courts once compensation has been claimed before one instance it is not possible to bring a claim for compensation before another one judges and juries what is the role of the judge and the jury in civil proceedings the role of the judge is to adjudicate the dispute by applying the law to the claims facts and evidence that are submitted by the parties a judge may not rule on matters not claimed by the parties judgment extra petita or award more than what was claimed by the parties judgment ultra petita he or she must decide on every claim brought forward by the parties the procedure is adversarial except in certain circumstances see questions 5 and 12 each party must submit the evidence on which it bases its claim judges supervise the admissibility relevance and weight of the evidence submitted by the parties a judge may upon a party s request or ex officio order an inquiry a witness deposition or the submission of certain documents he or she may also appoint experts or issue a request to another foreign court in respect of the same measures pursuant to the maxim da mihi factum dabo tibi ius give me the facts and i will give you the law the parties need only in theory to submit the facts and evidence of their claims to the judge who must identify and apply the law to decide the case this obligation has been reaffirmed several times by the supreme court including with respect to foreign law although in theory the parties have no obligation to argue or prove the law on which they rely practice shows that legal argument and discussing the law or the foreign law before the judge are an essential part of the lawyer s role finally a judge is the guardian of public policy he or she must ensure that relevant provisions of public policy are not violated and may not entertain claims or remedies that would be against public policy there are no jury trials in civil proceedings in belgium to be appointed as a judge the candidate must be belgian and hold a master s degree in law the other requirements depend

appointed as a judge immediately without judicial training but have to pass written and oral exams oral examination a candidate who has worked as an attorney for at least 20 years or for 15 years as an attorney and at least five years as an in house lawyer is entitled to be appointed immediately on the basis of an oral examination without having to pass a written exam depending on the vacant positions the superior council of justice selects candidates who have fulfilled the conditions set out above the selection is based on objective criteria related to the candidates abilities and capacities limitation issues what are the time limits for bringing civil claims under belgian law terms of limitation are a matter of substantive not procedural law they will therefore be determined by reference to the substantive law applicable to the dispute as shall be designated by the court s conflict of laws rules under belgian law the main terms of limitation are as follows a real action claim for the recovery or protection of real property shall be time barred after 30 years 10 years in some circumstances claims in tort are time barred five years after the day on which the plaintiff is aware of the injury and of the identity of the person liable for this injury and in any event 20 years and one day after the date on which the fact action or negligence that caused the prejudice occurred and most other claims are time barred after 10 years eg the term of limitation to enforce a judgment is 10 years there are many exceptions to these general terms of limitation in respect of property leases compensation for the termination of commercial agency agreements professional fees etc finally the above terms of limitations can be renewed by serving a writ of summons notice of a payment request or attachment if the plaintiff acknowledges the debt or if the creditor s lawyer bailiff or representative sends a letter of formal notice to the debtor located in belgium provided this letter meets certain legal requirements pre action behaviour are there any pre action considerations the parties should take into account with a few exceptions such as in disputes regarding residential lease and land lease agreements belgian law does not require any action to be taken before legal proceedings are initiated if the parties have agreed on mediation or on another form of pretrial adr the court shall stay the proceedings at the defendant s request until the adr method has had a chance to succeed the defendant domiciled in belgium may require the foreign plaintiff to post a guarantee covering the costs of the proceedings and of service before the court hears the claim cautio iudicatum solvi this does not apply if the claimant is domiciled in the european union or in a state that has concluded a treaty with belgium exempting claimants from this obligation starting proceedings how are civil proceedings commenced how and when are the parties to the proceedings notified of their commencement do the courts have the capacity to handle their caseload in most cases a process server will serve summons on the defendant either by delivering a writ of service to the defendant s address or through other methods of service available under international conventions after service has occurred the claim will be recorded in the court s registry in certain cases the summons can be filed by the claimant with the court rather than served the court will then send notice to the defendant by registered mail the defendant is notified of the commencement of proceedings when he or she receives the notification of the court by registered mail the defendant is deemed to have received this notification on the day following the one when the notification was brought to his or her domicile residence or address for service the summons must comply with strict requirements regarding the identification of the parties to the dispute the factual background of the dispute the claim and the relief sought the court seised and the date time and place of the introductory hearing parties are allowed to raise new arguments during the exchange of briefs however under belgian law a new claim ie an application aiming at extending or modifying the scope of the initial application must be based at least in part on statements or facts contained in the initial writ of summons there is a minimum waiting period of eight days between the date of service and the date of the introductory hearing in court when the defendant is a foreign resident the period of notice is extended by an additional 15 days for countries with which belgium shares a border and for the united kingdom 30 days for other countries in europe and 80 days for the rest of the world in urgent cases an application may be lodged with the court for an ex parte order shortening the waiting period a third way of introducing a claim is by an ex parte application filed with the court in this case the defendant is not notified or served and is not made aware of the commencement of proceedings a claim can only be lodged ex parte if the law expressly provides so such as in proceedings for the enforcement of arbitral awards or foreign judgments or applications for authorisation to attach assets a claim for temporary measures can also be initiated by an ex parte application when exceptional circumstances warrant this such as extreme urgency the need to take the defendant by surprise or the impossibility of identifying the adverse party such as in cases of strikes finally the parties may also file a joint application to the court and request the court to settle their dispute some of the belgian courts particularly the courts of appeal have a backlog of cases which can delay the adjudication of a dispute for several years recent amendments to the belgian judicial code together with the appointment of more judges and court assistants have led to improvements the belgian judicial code also allows for expedited procedures in a series of cases moreover initiatives are taken by some courts in order to manage their caseload in a timely manner for instance the brussels court of the enterprise made a series of organisational changes effective from 1 september 2015 four chambers are reserved for matters to be dealt with by the presiding chairs of the court urgent relief etc eight chambers deal with the introduction of new cases and summary proceedings see question 6 eleven other chambers manage classical proceedings on merits other distinct chambers devote their time to specific matters order for payment etc some hearings are expressly left open every six weeks in order to handle case management issues and a list of cases in which the parties are ready to plead is set up so as to allow for hearings to be scheduled at short notice timetable what is the typical procedure and timetable for a civil claim generally speaking belgian civil proceedings comprise five phases service or notice introductory hearing exchange of briefs oral pleadings held before the court and the judgment rendered by the court the claim is usually not heard at the introductory hearing but postponed in order for the parties to exchange briefs simple claims uncontested claims interim measures such as the appointment of experts see question 12 language issues see question 36 challenges to the court s jurisdiction and a few other matters may be heard at the introductory hearing upon the introductory hearing the court or the parties see question 7 must set a procedural timetable that determines both the deadlines for filing the parties briefs and the date of the oral hearing parties may however ask jointly for the postponing of the case for an indefinite period case management can the parties control the procedure and the timetable the power of initiative rests mainly with the parties particularly with the claimant the courts will not take any initiative and will act only if a party has requested it to do so the parties may agree on the timetable for exchanging briefs and on postponing the oral hearing the courts will determine ex officio the calendar when the parties do not reach an agreement on it if a new and relevant fact is discovered by a party after the deadlines for exchanging briefs the judge may at that party s request grant new deadlines and if necessary a new date for the oral hearing when the parties do not agree on other procedural matters the courts will step in at the request of one of the parties and issue procedural orders new provisions have been inserted in the belgian judicial code to allow for the electronic management of cases however these provisions are not fully effective yet due to a lack of technical means so far it is possible to file written submissions by electronic means with the registries of the courts of appeal the courts of the enterprise and some justices of the peace the system is also currently being tested before some courts of first instance antwerp ghent liège and namur evidence documents is there a duty to preserve documents and other evidence pending trial must parties share relevant documents including those unhelpful to their case the belgian judicial code does not impose a general duty to preserve documents and other evidence pending trial however such obligation may result from other laws thus tax and accounting laws impose an obligation to keep records and accounts for a number of years further there is no general obligation to share evidence with the other parties there is no discovery process under belgian law however if there is reason to believe that a party or a third party holds a document that is likely to prove a fact that is relevant to the dispute the court may order that party or third party to submit it if the party or third party in question refuses to produce the document without a valid reason eg the document is privileged it can be ordered to pay a non compliance penalty in addition the court may depending on the circumstances at hand infer from a party s refusal to submit certain documents that the disputed fact is proven or such other inference as the court shall deem reasonable evidence privilege are any documents privileged would advice from an in house lawyer whether local or foreign also be privileged communications between lawyers who are members of a bar and their clients medical records and some other documents are considered privileged and will not be allowed as evidence by the courts disclosing such documents or information may even depending on circumstances constitute an offence criminally prosecuted some communications between in house lawyers and their clients will also be deemed privileged external lawyers documents exchanged between external lawyers and their clients are covered by professional secrecy as protected by the belgian criminal code belgian courts have until now been very protective of professional secrecy and allowed few exceptions for example the belgian constitutional court has partly cancelled a law regarding money laundering that imposed an obligation on lawyers to blow the whistle on their clients in certain transactions communications between external lawyers are confidential pursuant to rules of conduct adopted by the bar councils as a rule any written correspondence between opposing lawyers in their capacity as counsel to a party is confidential with limited exceptions as far as cross border communications with european external lawyers is concerned the code of conduct for european lawyers of the council of bars and law societies of europe guarantees confidentiality only in the event that the lawyer who intends to send a confidential letter to a lawyer in another member state clearly expresses this intention before sending the letter in question and the recipient does not immediately protest such announcement with regard to cross border communications with other external lawyers extreme caution is recommended in house lawyers the belgian act of 1 march 2000 establishing the institute of in house lawyers preserves the confidentiality of legal advice given by an in house lawyer for the benefit of his or her employer and in his or her capacity as legal adviser the protection granted by this provision is narrower than that which applies to communications between a lawyer and his or her client the statute only covers legal advice thereby excluding draft agreements minutes of meetings correspondence with other companies communications that only contain information etc the confidentiality rule also does not cover communications with persons other than the employer or the company s external lawyers neither does it apply when the letter sent to the employer is also sent to other persons and third parties therefore correspondence with the lawyer of the adversary party is not confidential however a convention was signed in 2006 between the belgian institute of in house lawyers and the belgian french and german speaking bar association which considers as confidential communications and negotiations between an in house lawyer and an external lawyer from the bar mentioned above confidentiality is safeguarded in both civil and criminal procedures as well as towards other authorities such as the social or environmental inspection and tax authorities the protection also stands before belgian competition authorities however the european court of justice decided in the 1982 am s case that the legal privilege of in house lawyers does not stand towards european competition authorities in 2010 in the akzo case the european court of justice confirmed this position and decided that the privileged character of communications between a lawyer and his or her client did not extend to the communications between a firm and its in house lawyers evidence pretrial do parties exchange written evidence from witnesses and experts prior to trial there is no pretrial discovery process in belgium witness statements and expert reports will be exchanged during trial and submitted together with the parties respective briefs see question 6 evidence trial how is evidence presented at trial do witnesses and experts give oral evidence general belgian civil procedure is accusatorial in nature since the courts have a rather passive role it is up to each party to prove the facts on which it bases its claim or defence witnesses while parties rarely rely on witnesses this is allowed under belgian law the parties may file witness statements affidavits and courts may order witness statements to be filed ex officio since august 2012 witness statements are subject to specific substantive and formal requirements the parties may request the court to order the deposition of a witness the court may also order the deposition ex officio this can take place either in court or at another location depending on circumstances if a witness refuses to appear voluntarily the court may summon the witness to appear subject to a non compliance penalty and damages a judge will be designated by the court to administer the oath to the witness and take the deposition as a matter of principle the judge alone may interrogate the witness if the parties are present they may not confront the witness directly and must submit their questions to the judge who decides whether to ask the question to the witness courts are usually flexible and will allow direct follow up or clarification questions experts court appointed experts the court may at a party s request or ex officio order an expert investigation it will then appoint an expert who will meet with the parties carry out an expert investigation and submit a draft report on his or her findings to the parties the parties will be allowed to comment on the draft report before the expert files the final report the court is not bound by the expert s findings the court may decide to hear the expert order additional investigations ask questions to the expert or appoint other experts party appointed experts the parties may file their own expert reports and request the court to hear their expert in this case the procedure for witness depositions applies interim remedies what interim remedies are available a claim can be brought before the presiding chair of a court to obtain urgent relief in summary proceedings such relief is temporary and does not bind the court that will hear the full case on its merits the conditions to obtain such relief are strict the plaintiff must show that urgent relief is required the plaintiff must have a prima facie claim the balance of interest must weigh in favour of granting the relief sought and the relief sought must only be of a temporary nature typical claims brought forth under these provisions include claims for the appointment of experts claims for a cease and desist order and claims for the appointment of an interim manager or auditor to supervise the management of a company when there are compelling reasons to avoid an adversarial discussion for instance because of the extreme urgency of the situation at hand or because of the need to take the adverse party by surprise these measures can even be obtained ex parte a similar fast track procedure is available in certain matters governed by specific laws resulting in a decision on the full merits of the case which will not be temporary but final subject to appeal this procedure referred to as procedure as in summary proceedings is available under a variety of laws such as before the presiding chair of a court of first instance regarding claims based on the act of 2 august 2002 regarding misleading advertising by professionals before the presiding chair of a court of the enterprise or a court of first instance regarding claims based on book xvii title 1 of the belgian code on economic law cease and desist orders in well defined matters like unfair market practices or alleged infringements of intellectual property rights and before the presiding chair of a court of the enterprise under the company code regarding claims for the exclusion of shareholders or the forced buyout of shares attachment or garnishment measures are available as a pretrial remedy if the claimant can show that he or she has a prima facie claim against the debtor and there is a risk that the debtor may become insolvent or try to avoid payment both movable including intangible assets and immovable property can be subject to an attachment order bank accounts are frequently garnished in belgium there are certain restrictions under which certain assets are immune from attachment such as clothes basic furniture and salary up to approximately 1 300 besides assets belonging to states international organisations and central banks are immune from enforcement there are five specific restrictions under belgian law pursuant to the act of 28 april 1999 implementing the eu directive 98 26 ec of 19 may 1998 on settlement in payment and securities settlement system the funds securities or securities entitlement of foreign states or instrumentalities held in the euroclear system or in other similar international clearing systems may not be attached article 1412bis of the belgian judicial code prevents attachments of the assets of the belgian state and public entities these assets are not immune if the concerned entity declares that they can be subject to attachment or if they are not necessary for the fulfilment of governmental purposes article 1412ter of the belgian judicial code prevents attachments of all cultural assets belonging to a foreign entity when such assets are present in the belgian territory for the purpose of a public and temporary exhibition article 1412quater of the belgian judicial code provides that any assets that foreign central banks or monetary institutions own or manage in belgium are immune from attachment however these assets are not immune if they are exclusively allocated to an economic or commercial private law activity the creditor seeking to attach these assets must demonstrate that they are not immune by filing an ex parte application for authorisation before the court of attachments prior to any attachment article 1412quinquies of the belgian judicial code provides that assets belonging to sovereign states and international supranational organisations are by their very nature immune from attachment see question 32 by way of derogation from that principle a creditor may seek the authorisation to attach assets of a sovereign state or organisation by filing an ex parte application with the court of attachments demonstrating that one of the following conditions is fulfilled the foreign state or organisation has explicitly consented to the attachment of the assets the foreign state or organisation has allocated or earmarked the assets for the satisfaction of the claim at hand or it is established that the assets are specifically in use or intended for use by the foreign state or organisation for other than non commercial governmental purposes and are located in the belgian territory with the provisio that only the assets related to the entity referred to in the enforceable title or authentic or private document underlying the attachment can be attached remedies what substantive remedies are available the main remedies available under belgian law are as follows a belgian court can order the specific performance of an obligation or enjoin a party to refrain from a certain action or behaviour typically these orders and injunctions will be subject to non compliance penalties the court may also allow the claimant to entrust the performance of the obligation in question to a third party at the defendant s expense the court may authorise the claimant to proceed with certain measures such as the publication of a statement in the press or instruct the domain name administrator or the ip registrar to strike out or transfer the domain name or ip right to the claimant s name or other measures and further a belgian court may also grant compensatory damages belgian law allows for the compensation of actual losses both economic losses and moral distress and consequential damages provided causation can be established however a belgian court cannot order the payment of punitive damages enforcement what means of enforcement are available since 1 january 2016 unless provided otherwise by law or decided otherwise by judges judgments from lower courts are immediately enforceable notwithstanding the initiation of an appeal likewise judgments handed down by the presiding chair of a court are enforceable immediately depending on the remedy awarded in the judgment enforcement will usually be carried out by a process server who will collect payment from the judgment debtor by attaching and selling the debtor s property and assets or by garnishment of the debtor s receivables and bank accounts and in respect of orders for specific performance serve the order and collect the non compliance penalties the judgment creditor may also force the judgment debtor into bankruptcy public access are court hearings held in public are court documents available to the public in accordance with the belgian constitution court hearings records and judgments are in principle public the access to hearings and judgments can be restricted in special circumstances publicity does not apply to inquiry measures such as witness testimony or judicial expertise exceptionally the law or the court itself may depart from the rule of publicity in the interest of public order the rights of minors or the right to privacy even in those cases the judgment itself remains public the availability of court documents has long been disputed some argue that all court documents are available to any interested party and that the court registry must provide a copy upon simple request others maintain that access to court documents can only be granted with the prior approval of the attorney general costs does the court have power to order costs in comparison with most countries in europe the cost of civil litigation in belgium is rather reasonable apart from a moderate procedural indemnity see below and apart from when a court determines that a party s conduct is extremely frivolous or vexatious there is no fee shifting in belgium the losing party will usually be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings these will include the following costs of service filing and registration with the court registry costs of witness depositions and judicial expertise if the payment of money is ordered and provided the amount is in excess of 12 500 a registration tax due to the tax administration of 3 per cent of the total amount payable pre judgment attachment costs and enforcement costs if any and a procedural indemnity the amount of the procedural indemnity is set by law this amount is adjusted from time to time for inflation since 1 june 2016 the amount of the procedural indemnity is calculated as follows if the claim cannot be appraised in monetary terms the basic amount of this indemnity is 1 440 in respect of claims that can be appraised in monetary terms the basic indemnity will range from 180 to 18 000 in certain circumstances the amounts set by the law may be increased to a maximum of 36 000 or decreased by the court these amounts must be paid by the losing party to each adverse winning party for each instance lower court higher court however if one party loses against several adverse winning parties the procedural indemnity that the losing party will be ordered to pay cannot exceed twice the maximum amount that is claimed by the winning adverse party that may claim the highest indemnity the procedural indemnity is not applicable to proceedings brought before the supreme court the costs of filing and registration with the court registry are fixed and depend on the nature of the writ that is filed with the court registry and on the amount of the claim moreover the filing costs are collected per claimant this undoubtedly has an impact on the initiation of class actions in belgium see question 19 funding arrangements are no win no fee agreements or other types of contingency or conditional fee arrangements between lawyers and their clients available to parties may parties bring proceedings using third party funding if so may the third party take a share of any proceeds of the claim may a party to litigation share its risk with a third party belgian law and rules of ethics require lawyers to charge fees with moderation and fairness in practice bar regulators require the fees to be reasonable and transparent and proportionate to the difficulty of the case and to the stakes of the dispute strict no win no pay contingency fees are not allowed however a lawyer may charge a reasonable success fee to his or her client if the outcome of the case warrants this third party funding is allowed the third party and the claimant may agree on sharing the proceeds of the dispute however short of assigning the claim this does not give the funding third party standing to take part in the proceedings extreme caution must be exercised when drafting the funding agreement and even more so the assignment agreement as belgian law allows the debtor of disputed claims to redeem the debt by paying back to the assignee the price paid for the assignment with interest and costs insurance is insurance available to cover all or part of a party s legal costs insurance for legal costs has long been available in belgium as part of or as an optional addition to automobile liability insurance the government has adopted measures to encourage the development of legal costs insurance policies in other sectors class action may litigants with similar claims bring a form of collective redress in what circumstances is this permitted there are various methods of multi party litigation that is litigation involving multiple claimants or defendants or both in belgium these include actions for collective redress class actions under the influence of the european commission recommendation on common legal principles on collective redress dated 11 june 2013 and of legislative initiatives in some neighbouring european countries a belgian act regarding class action proceedings was passed on 28 march 2014 the act was introduced in book xvii title 2 of the belgian code of economic law and came into force on 1 september 2014 the need was clearly felt both to ensure access to court in those situations where the circumstances discourage an individual to act on his or her own and to ease and enhance the efficient settlement of multiparty disputes the scope of this act is very limited only groups of consumers represented by non profit organisations or public bodies are allowed to bring a class action suit and this suit must be addressed against an enterprise as defined in question 1 in case of an alleged violation of specifically enumerated belgian and european rules insurance banking and finance energy passenger transport etc on 6 june 2017 the scope of the class action regime was extended to infringements of eu competition law articles 101 and 102 tfeu including the ban on cartels and abuses of dominant positions the brussels court of first instance and the brussels court of the enterprise have an exclusive jurisdiction to rule on class actions since the entry into force of the act in september 2014 six class actions have been introduced before belgian courts all these actions have been brought by test achats test aankoop the main belgian consumer protection organisation the first class action was initiated to obtain compensation from the national railway company of belgium nmbs sncb for the interruption and the suspension of the train service during eight days of national strikes in 2014 and 2015 no decision was handed down in that case since the parties reached an amicable settlement before the hearings on the admissibility of the class action the second class action has been brought against the commercial airline company thomas cook following the delay of a flight on 4 april 2016 that action was found admissible by the brussels court of first instance the court decided to apply the opt in system ie only the consumers that have suffered the collective harm and have expressly notified the court s registry of their intention to be part of the group within six weeks will belong to the group the third class action was brought against the volkswagen group within the context of dieselgate the fourth action was initiated against the belgian telecommunications company proximus after it introduced a renting formula for its new decoders the most recent class actions were brought against eight websites involved in the resale of concert tickets at high prices and against groupon belgium in 2014 the belgian government stated that class actions as provided in the act of 28 march 2014 will be assessed two years after its enactment at the end of 2016 the belgian federal public service economy sent a questionnaire to stakeholders about the admissibility requirements composition of the group conduct of the proceedings procedural costs and funding etc the belgian government has then assessed class action proceedings on the basis of the results of the questionnaire on that basis on 1 september 2017 the belgian council of ministers approved a preliminary draft bill extending the access to class actions to small and medium sized enterprises smes further to some amendments the draft bill was adopted by the competent committee of the chamber of representatives on 6 march 2018 and is soon to be put to vote in plenary session actions of collective interest in certain cases the law allows some form of representative action where consumer or professional organisations may seek injunctive relief against practices that harm the interests of consumers or of the members of the organisation cases arise frequently in respect of advertising for consumer goods consumer safety or securities offerings these organisations cannot recover damages for their members they may however seek damages for themselves to the extent that the practice in question harms their own personal interests similar remedies exist in environmental law in addition workers unions and qualified human rights organisations are allowed to seek injunctive relief against practices that violate certain labour rights or non discrimination laws collective related actions several individual legal actions arising from a similar event or the same contract can be joined and consolidated in the same proceedings by different claimants who are often represented by the same lawyer this happens for instance in major securities fraud or negligence cases the related actions are handled by the court jointly even if they remain from a legal perspective individual actions appeal on what grounds and in what circumstances can the parties appeal is there a right of further appeal any judgment can be appealed both on the findings of fact and on the findings of law the court of appeals hears the dispute de novo the main exception is when the lower court adjudicates a claim that is for less than 1 860 justice of the peace or 2 500 first instance and enterprise judgments handed down by lower courts are in principle immediately enforceable unless provided otherwise by law or decided otherwise by judges see question 14 it means that an appeal does not stay the enforcement of judgments rendered by lower courts there is a right of further appeal or immediate appeal if the judgment does not meet the thresholds for a first appeal to the supreme court see question 1 appeal to the supreme court is limited to questions of law and formal requirements foreign judgments what procedures exist for recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments within the european union judgments rendered in a member state of the european union resulting from proceedings initiated as from 10 january 2015 will be recognised and enforced in belgium in accordance with the provisions of council regulation eu no 1215 2012 of 12 december 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters brussels ibis the eu regulation no 44 2001 of 20 december 2000 brussels i still rules the recognition and enforcement in belgium of judgments resulting from proceedings initiated before 10 january 2015 the eu regulation no 1215 2012 provides that a judgment given in a member state that is enforceable in that member state shall be enforceable in other member states without any declaration of enforceability being required assimilation the grounds for denying enforcement under regulation brussels ibis are the same as the grounds for denying recognition and enforcement under regulation brussels i that is where there is a violation of due process and where recognition or enforcement would be manifestly contrary to public policy when the foreign judgment is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties and when the foreign judgment infringes rules on mandatory jurisdiction insurance consumer contracts and employment contracts and exclusive jurisdiction furthermore regulation brussels ibis expressly introduced the possibility to file a claim to obtain a declaration of unenforceability of a foreign judgment the council decision 2007 712 ec applies to the recognition and the enforcement of judgments rendered in member states of the european free trade association no security bond or deposit may be required of a party that applies for enforcement of a judgment given on the ground that he or she is a foreign national or that he or she is not resident in belgium outside the european union the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments rendered in countries with which belgium has not concluded a treaty are governed by the belgian code of private international law a foreign judgment will be denied recognition and enforcement in the following circumstances recognition and enforcement are manifestly contrary to public policy the rights of defence due process have not been respected the foreign court was designated by the parties with the sole intention of escaping the application of the mandatory laws designated by the conflict of laws rules of the code of international private law the foreign decision is not final and still open to an ordinary appeal the decision is not compatible with an earlier judgment rendered in belgium or with a decision rendered earlier abroad that is capable of being recognised in belgium the claim has been initiated abroad after a claim had been lodged before the belgian courts between the same parties and with the same object belgian courts had exclusive jurisdiction to hear the claim or the foreign court had jurisdiction solely because the defendant was present or had assets in the foreign jurisdiction without any relation between that presence or assets and the claim procedure under the eu regulation brussels ibis the creditor must not obtain judicial leave to enforce a foreign judgment in belgium he or she shall immediately enforce it in belgium with the assistance of a bailiff provided the creditor provides him or her with an authenticated copy of the judgment and a certificate issued by the member state of origin the certificate must be served on the debtor before laying any measure of enforcement the bailiff or the served debtor may ask for a translation of the judgment the debtor may challenge the enforcement measures by filing an application to obtain a declaration of unenforceability before the competent court of first instance an appeal can be lodged with the court of appeal against the decision rendered by the court of first instance if the eu regulation brussels i is still applicable or if the judgment is handed down in a country with which belgium does not have a treaty the procedure for obtaining leave to enforce the foreign judgment in belgium is reasonably fast the application is filed ex parte before the court of first instance of the district where the defendant is domiciled or has his or her residence or the place where enforcement will probably be sought according to belgian law even if a foreign judgment has not yet been declared enforceable in belgium it is sufficient to provisionally attach assets located in belgium while the enforcement procedure is pending the applicant must elect domicile in the district where the application is filed together with the following documents an authenticated copy of the judgment for a judgment from countries with which belgium does not have a treaty the copy must be legalised by belgian diplomatic authorities if the judgment was handed down by default evidence that the claim was served or notified to the judgment defendant only for a judgment from countries with which belgium does not have a treaty evidence that the judgment is enforceable in the country of origin and that it has been served or notified to the judgment defendant such evidence is provided for european judgments by the certificate that must be filed by application of articles 53 and 54 of regulation 44 2001 and in addition the courts may and generally do require a translation of the judgment if it is written in a language other than the court s language the court will review the application summarily and make a formal check of the documents accompanying the application the order handed down in ex parte proceedings can be challenged by the judgment debtor before the same court within a period of one month from the date of service of the enforcement order although this suspends the enforcement of the foreign judgment the judgment defendant s assets may be attached or his or her accounts garnished as a guarantee for the enforcement of the judgment if the court has denied the enforcement order sought by the judgment creditor or has rejected the judgment debtor s challenge of the enforcement order the defeated party may file an appeal before the court of appeal however in the case of enforcement under regulation brussels i the debtor may only lodge an appeal against the enforcement order before the supreme court foreign proceedings are there any procedures for obtaining oral or documentary evidence for use in civil proceedings in other jurisdictions regarding evidence to be taken either in belgium in support of proceedings in another eu country or in another country of the eu in support of litigation in belgium the rules are set by council regulation ec 1206 2001 of 28 may 2001 on cooperation between the member states in the taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters the regulation seeks to streamline cooperation in the gathering of evidence abroad in the relations between the member states of the european union the aim of the regulation is to simplify and speed up the transmission and execution of requests for obtaining evidence through techniques such as the deposition of witnesses and the inspection of documents or objects according to the regulation the requesting court must directly address its request to the courts in the country where the evidence must be obtained and that have jurisdiction over the witness to be heard or the person holding the requested document the requested courts then have 90 days to process the request parties and representatives of the requesting court have the right to be present during the taking of evidence by the requested court if the law of the requesting court allows such presence a requesting court may also be authorised to directly proceed to the taking of evidence in the other country if this can be done on a voluntary basis without the need for coercive measures in respect of evidence located in states that are not bound by council regulation ec 1206 2001 belgium applies the hague convention of 1 march 1954 on civil procedure belgium has also concluded a number of bilateral treaties on civil procedure and judicial cooperation most of these treaties were concluded with european union member states inter alia france and germany and have become moot as a result of the adoption of ec regulation 1206 2001 in respect of those states with which belgium does not have a treaty the belgian judicial code operates as a fallback mechanism and belgium will enforce letters of request issued by foreign courts and transmitted by foreign governments pursuant to the relevant provisions of the belgian judicial code the procedure however is very time consuming and therefore often inadequate for obtaining evidence in the context of proceedings pending abroad foreign parties may also apply to the belgian courts directly rather than through a letter of request sent by the foreign court to the belgian court under the provisions of the belgian judicial code for obtaining evidence in belgium briefly the following measures can be sought deposing witnesses obtaining the production of documents see question 8 and obtaining the designation of a court appointed expert in urgent cases these measures can be obtained in summary proceedings before the chairperson of a court of the enterprise a court of first instance or a labour court see question 12 arbitration uncitral model law is the arbitration law based on the uncitral model law yes since the entry into force on 1 september 2013 of the new law on arbitration of 24 june 2013 which amended the sixth part of the belgian judicial code the new belgian regime is to a large extent inspired by the uncitral model law the belgian regime however keeps certain specificities for example on the grounds for annulment see question 31 and the absence of ex parte interim measures ordered by the arbitral tribunal the new rules apply to arbitral proceedings that commenced after their entry into force on 1 september 2013 in 2016 by an act of 25 december 2016 some minor changes and corrections of the law on arbitration of 24 june 2013 were implemented these amendments pertain mostly to the arbitration procedure and not to the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards they entered into force on 9 january 2017 arbitration agreements what are the formal requirements for an enforceable arbitration agreement pursuant to the new provisions on arbitration in the belgian judicial code an arbitration agreement is not necessarily a written document and can even be oral as long as it can be proved by all means of law any document including emails letters faxes and contracts may contain an arbitration agreement as long as it clearly expresses the parties intention to submit their disputes to arbitration in the absence of such document other elements such as the acknowledgment of the arbitration agreement by a party or the voluntary appearance before the arbitral tribunal may constitute evidence of the existence of the arbitration agreement whether a party can invoke an arbitration clause inserted in its general terms and conditions depends on the general law of obligations applicable pursuant to belgian conflict of law rules in particular the rules pertaining to the enforceability of such terms and conditions generally speaking the formal requirements in civil matters are more severe than in commercial matters where the mere reference to a document containing an arbitration clause may suffice if the defendant had or could have had knowledge thereof at the time of execution of the contract and accepted it or raised no objection choice of arbitrator if the arbitration agreement and any relevant rules are silent on the matter how many arbitrators will be appointed and how will they be appointed are there restrictions on the right to challenge the appointment of an arbitrator when the parties have not agreed on the number of arbitrators the arbitral tribunal will comprise three arbitrators if the arbitration agreement is silent on the way the arbitral tribunal should be set up the plaintiff must notify the defendant of its intention to resort to arbitration state the name of the arbitrator of its choice and invite the defendant to appoint an arbitrator if the defendant fails to appoint an arbitrator within one month as from the notification sent by the plaintiff the latter can request the chairperson of a court of first instance to appoint the arbitrator the same applies in the event the party appointed arbitrators fail to reach agreement on who should chair the arbitral tribunal this process can be time consuming especially if one of the parties refuses to participate in setting up the arbitral tribunal and undermines every effort to that end it is therefore highly recommended that the parties either nominate the arbitrators in their arbitration agreement or alternatively leave the appointment of the arbitrators to the decision of a neutral appointing authority such as an arbitration institution an arbitrator can be challenged on the following grounds he or she lacks the legal capacity to act as an arbitrator he or she does not meet the requirements that have been set in the arbitration agreement or circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to his or her impartiality or independence a party cannot challenge the appointment of an arbitrator on the basis of grounds of which he or she was aware when the appointment was made unless he or she objected to the appointment at that time the parties may also agree upon a procedure for challenging the appointment of arbitrators failing an agreement the party that wishes to challenge the appointment of an arbitrator must first notify its objections to the concerned arbitrator the other arbitrators if any and to the other party the arbitrator then has 10 days to withdraw if he or she does not do so a motion can be filed before the chairperson of the competent court of first instance for an order dismissing the arbitrator arbitrator options what are the options when choosing an arbitrator or arbitrators parties have a wide margin of discretion regarding the appointment of arbitrators they can either address the issue of the appointment of arbitrator s in their arbitration agreement or when the dispute arises belgian law does not require any specific qualifications in order to be appointed as an arbitrator parties are free to appoint the arbitrators of their choice a lawyer or an expert in a specific area such as the building industry for instance the only requirement is that arbitrators must be independent and impartial at the time of their appointment and throughout the proceedings and that the choice of arbitrator cannot be based on unfair discriminatory reasons parties usually refer to the rules of an arbitral institution in their arbitration agreement cepani the belgian centre for arbitration and mediation is the most important arbitration institution in belgium it publishes on its website a list of members who have experience in arbitration and can be appointed as arbitrators arbitral procedure does the domestic law contain substantive requirements for the procedure to be followed the belgian judicial code sets out the procedural rules that will apply to the arbitration provided however that the parties or arbitrators have not agreed otherwise in the case of ad hoc arbitration or provided that the arbitration institution does not itself dispose of a set of procedural rules in the case of institutional arbitration the belgian judicial code sets down these rules in chronological order corresponding with the different phases of the arbitral proceedings the arbitration agreement see question 24 the composition of the arbitral tribunal as well as the replacement and challenge of its composing members see question 25 the actual arbitral proceedings including the power of the arbitral tribunal to order interim and conservatory measures see question 29 the arbitral award see question 30 and the end of the arbitral proceedings the actions available against the arbitral award including the correction interpretation and completion of the award as well as the appeal against and annulment of the award see question 31 and the enforcement of the arbitral award see question 32 as indicated above in principle these rules only apply by default and are thus not mandatory with the exception of the provisions on the impartiality and independence of arbitrators the adversarial nature of the procedure and the recourses against the award court intervention on what grounds can the court intervene during an arbitration the intervention of the chairperson of a court of first instance may be sought in respect of the appointment of the arbitrators see question 25 a court of first instance can hear challenges of arbitrators see question 25 while arbitral tribunals may order interim and conservatory measures see question 29 the parties may also apply to the courts to obtain urgent interim relief see question 12 interim and conservatory measures are ordered on an ex parte basis the application must be filed with the court of first instance of the place where the party against whom enforcement is sought has its domicile or residence in belgium or in the absence of such domicile or residence the place where the applicant wishes to enforce the award the decision of the court shall not be subject to an appeal of any sort when a witness refuses to be deposed before an arbitral tribunal the deposition will be taken before a court of first instance all claims that documents are forged or that signatures are not authentic may only be heard by a court of first instance there is no supervision of the making or drafting of the arbitral award itself but a court of first instance can assign a deadline to the arbitrator or arbitrators to deliver the award the recognition and enforcement of an award are also sought before a judicial court interim relief do arbitrators have powers to grant interim relief in accordance with the belgian judicial code the arbitral tribunal may order any such interim or conservatory measures it deems fit except issuing attachment orders as this comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of state courts the arbitral tribunal s authority to grant interim measures does not restrict the parties from seeking interim relief from the courts if urgency so requires see questions 12 and 28 typical examples of interim relief granted by an arbitral tribunal are an order to submit documents or to depose witnesses an order to provide security for costs or the appointment of an expert to assist on technical issues or to assess damages however the arbitral tribunal has no authority to force reluctant witnesses to be deposed or to decide claims that documents were forged or that signatures are not authentic another example of an interim measure is an order to hand over a disputed asset or document to a third party until the end of the arbitral proceedings so as to safeguard it award when and in what form must the award be delivered in principle the arbitral tribunal takes its decision by a simple majority unless the parties have agreed otherwise the parties may also agree that the chairperson s vote is decisive in the event that the arbitrators fail to reach a majority the arbitral award must be in writing and signed by the arbitrators in the event that one or more of the arbitrators cannot or refuse to sign this must be reported in the award itself the award sets out the decision of the arbitral tribunal and the reasons on which the award is based furthermore the award must state the names and domiciles of the arbitrators and of the parties the subject matter of the dispute the date of the award and the seat of the arbitration if the arbitration is not organised under the auspices of an institution the chairperson of the arbitral tribunal notifies every party by sending a duly signed copy of the arbitral award appeal on what grounds can an award be appealed to the court appeal proceedings are extremely rare in belgium where most awards are considered final and binding under belgian law it is impossible to file an appeal against an arbitral award before a court in the rare cases where the parties provide for an appeal against the award in their arbitration agreement the appeal will be lodged before an arbitral tribunal composed of different arbitrators unless the parties have agreed otherwise the procedure including the composition of the new arbitral tribunal is similar to the procedure applied before the first arbitral tribunal see question 27 unless the arbitration agreement provides otherwise the parties must file their appeal within one month of the date of service of the arbitral award the new rules provide that the one month period starts as from the date of notification of the award nonetheless the original arbitral tribunal may decide that its award is provisionally enforceable notwithstanding appeal when the arbitration agreement does not provide for an appeal a party wishing to challenge an arbitral award may file an application for setting aside or challenging its recognition and enforcement on 16 february 2017 the belgian constitutional court found that third parties to arbitration proceedings should be entitled to file a third party opposition against arbitral awards if these awards infringe their rights the third party opposition is a judicial remedy available to persons who were neither parties nor represented in the main proceedings but who suffer damage as a result of the decision handed down in those proceedings so far such a recourse was only possible against judicial court decisions and not against arbitral awards in its decision the belgian constitutional court stated that court decisions and arbitral awards have the same effects towards third parties however the belgian lawmaker will have to define the legal regime of this new type of third party opposition which cannot be brought before the arbitral tribunal as there is no arbitration clause binding the third party but will have to be introduced by the third party before a judicial court filing a claim for setting aside annulling the award when the arbitral award has been rendered in belgium a party may seek the annulment of all or part of the award on one or a combination of the following grounds pursuant to the new rules on arbitration these grounds for annulment have become stricter under the former regime additional grounds were available which are not listed below the court of first instance can set aside the award only if i there was no valid arbitration agreement including if one of the parties did not have the legal capacity to enter into the arbitration agreement ii due process requirements were not respected unless the breach has had no influence on the arbitral award iii the award deals with a dispute not falling within the terms of the arbitration agreement a partial annulment is possible iv the award does not contain the reasoning of the arbitrators v the arbitral tribunal was irregularly constituted or the procedure was not complied with except if the irregularity has had no influence on the arbitral award vi the arbitral tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction or powers vii the underlying dispute is not arbitrable viii the award is contrary to public policy and ix the award was obtained by fraud the grounds mentioned under i ii iii and v above can no longer be invoked to request the setting aside of the award if the party was aware of them during the arbitration proceedings but failed to raise them at that point the grounds mentioned under vii viii and ix are the only ones that can be raised ex officio by the court the claim for setting aside the award must be filed no later than three months after the date of notice of the arbitral award except with respect to positive arbitral awards on jurisdiction that can only be set aside together with the final award the new rules allow the court handling the annulment claim to adjourn the dispute and invite the arbitrators to take measures to remedy the irregularity that founds the annulment claim pursuant to the new rules the decision that allows or rejects the claim for annulment of the award cannot be appealed if all parties are non belgian they can waive their right to apply for setting aside the award before or after the dispute arose this waiver must expressly refer to setting aside proceedings a general waiver to invoke any legal recourse will not be sufficient in that respect belgian parties cannot waive this right a waiver would be deemed null and void a party may also seek to challenge the enforcement of the arbitral award see question 32 since january 2017 the party that lodges a recourse against the exequatur order of an arbitral award and wants to annul the same award has to introduce concomitantly and in the same procedure an annulment application provided that the time limit to file an annulment application has not expired with that reform the legislator gave jurisdiction to the same court to hear enforcement proceedings of an arbitral award issued in belgium and concurrent setting aside proceedings brought against the same award enforcement what procedures exist for enforcement of foreign and domestic awards pursuant to the new rules an application for leave to enforce an arbitral award whether foreign or domestic must be submitted to the court of first instance of the place where the party against whom enforcement is sought has its domicile or residence in belgium or in the absence of such domicile or residence the place where the applicant wishes to enforce the award this application is ex parte the party against whom enforcement is sought has subject to exception no right to be heard at this stage of the procedure the party seeking to enforce the award must elect domicile in the court s district and file with its application the following documents the authenticated original arbitral award or a certified copy thereof the arbitration agreement or a certified copy thereof and a certified translation of both the award and agreement into the language of the court proceedings as far as domestic awards are concerned enforcement of the award will be denied if the court finds that either the award or its enforcement would be contrary to public policy if the dispute was not arbitrable or in respect of foreign awards that do not fall under the scope of the new york convention of 10 june 1958 if one of the other grounds for refusal exists to a large extent the new rules on arbitration match the grounds for annulment and the grounds for non recognition for both domestic and foreign awards as regards foreign awards the application will be based in most cases on the 1958 new york convention or on one of the bilateral conventions mentioned below if the state where the arbitral award was rendered is not a party to any treaty or convention the court will apply the rules set out in the belgian judicial code belgium has adopted the 1958 new york convention subject to reciprocity and applies the convention both to commercial and civil disputes belgium has also signed five bilateral conventions regarding the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards with austria france germany the netherlands and switzerland the bilateral conventions as well as the 1958 new york convention all provide that the party seeking to enforce the award is allowed to choose the legal regime that seems the most favourable towards recognition and enforcement if enforcement is allowed the party against whom enforcement is sought can challenge the enforcement order within one month as from the date of service of the order although this procedure does not by itself stay the enforcement of the award the party against whom enforcement is sought may request a court of first instance for domestic awards or the judge of the attachments in a court of first instance for foreign awards to order a temporary stay of the enforcement if he or she proves that there is a strong prima facie chance that the enforcement order will be reversed the party against whom enforcement is sought may also escrow the amount that he or she has been ordered to pay so as to avoid the actual remittance to the party seeking to enforce the award if enforcement is denied the claimant may only lodge an appeal against this decision before the belgian supreme court a challenge before a court of appeal is not possible under belgian law the term of limitation to enforce an award is 10 years as from the date of the notification of the award to the parties since 13 september 2015 assets belonging to foreign states and international supranational organisations are immune from attachment pursuant to article 1412quinquies of the belgian judicial code see question 12 the act of 23 august 2015 introducing article 1412quinquies in the belgian judicial code was partially annulled by the belgian constitutional court on 27 april 2017 costs can a successful party recover its costs unless otherwise agreed the fees and expenses of the arbitrators the administrative fees of the institution if any and the parties reasonable fees and costs including legal costs and expert costs shall be allocated between the parties by the arbitral tribunal in the final award alternative dispute resolution types of adr what types of adr process are commonly used is a particular adr process popular to prevent or resolve a dispute the parties may turn to several types of adr such as third party decision conciliation mediation or arbitration and several mixed types of adr such as the ombudsman organised within the auspices of certain autonomous public undertakings such as the postal service and the railway service and the mini trial organised by cepani there are no legal formalities with regard to the first two types of adr conciliation may be voluntary or mandatory see question 35 a specific chapter of the belgian judicial code is dedicated to mediation the type of adr chosen will mostly depend on the nature of the dispute while mediation is commonly used in family disputes other adr methods are often used in commercial disputes a belgian act regarding adr in order to settle consumer disputes was passed on 4 april 2014 as a result of the enforcement of two european directives 2013 11 eu and 2009 22 ec the act was introduced in book xvi of the belgian code of economic law and came into force on 1 june 2015 and has been amended by the law of 26 october 2015 requirements for adr is there a requirement for the parties to litigation or arbitration to consider adr before or during proceedings can the court or tribunal compel the parties to participate in an adr process certain issues require a conciliation attempt before the introduction of court proceedings for example with regard to labour law land lease and the protection of the environment when the parties have agreed to adr the courts will give effect to their agreement at the request of either party but not ex officio the courts will compel the parties to exhaust the adr method on which they had agreed before allowing the parties to proceed before the courts adr clauses are in principle without prejudice to either party s right to seek interim measures see question 12 miscellaneous interesting features are there any particularly interesting features of the dispute resolution system not addressed in any of the previous questions although belgium is a very small country it has three official languages dutch french and german the use of language in court proceedings is regulated in the mandatory provisions of the belgian act of 15 june 1935 which deals with the language of the introductory act to the proceedings the request to obtain a change of language the use of language during the proceedings the exceptions following from the non observance of these mandatory rules and the use of documents drafted in a language other than the language of the proceedings pursuant to a reform approved in 2012 the courts of first instance the courts of the enterprise the labour and police courts in brussels were split into french speaking courts and dutch speaking courts the use of language in arbitration proceedings on the other hand is not regulated moreover since 1 april 2014 the number of districts has been reduced from 27 to 12 for the courts of first instance with the splitting in two of the district of brussels and from 27 to nine for the courts of the enterprise with the splitting in two of the district of brussels update and trends update and trends are there any proposals for dispute resolution reform when will any reforms take effect please also mention any ground breaking recent cases etc at the end of 2017 the belgian government approved a preliminary act for the creation of the brussels international business court bibc pursuant to that preliminary act the bibc is a special state court dealing with the settlement of international business disputes the proceedings will be conducted in english the decisions of the bibc will not be subject to appeal but challengeable before the supreme court on points of law the bibc will be composed of a professional judge and two lay judges lawyers university professors etc the composition of the chambers of the bibc will vary depending on the nature of the dispute the rules of procedure are likely to be based on the uncitral model law as from substantive law the bibc will apply the law chosen by the parties in their agreement

surging crude prices are posing another headwind for the world economy after president donald trump s zero pledge on iran oil sales brent crude has risen about 40 percent this year and is at the highest in six months while higher prices due to strong demand typically reflects a robust world economy a shock from constrained supply is a negative much will depend on how sustained the spike proves to be exporting nations will enjoy a boost to corporate and government revenues while consuming nations will bear the cost at the pump potentially fanning inflation and hurting demand ultimately there comes a point where higher prices may be damaging to everyone 1 what does it mean for global growth the impact will vary rising oil prices will hurt household income and spending and it could accelerate inflation as the world s biggest importer of oil china is vulnerable and many countries in europe also rely on imported energy seasonal effects will also impact with the northern hemisphere summer approaching consumers can switch energy sources and scale back usage a slowing world economy will also hurt demand and by extension keep a lid on prices 2 how can the world economy absorb oil at 100 for a sustained hit to growth economists say oil would need to hold above 100 it also depends on dollar strength or weakness given crude is priced in greenbacks analysis by oxford economics found that brent at 100 per barrel by the end of 2019 means the level of global gross domestic product would be 0 6 percent lower than currently projected by end 2020 with inflation on average 0 7 percentage points higher we see increased risks of significantly higher oil prices oxford economists john payne and gabriel sterne wrote in a note in the short run it is likely the supply impact will be offset by higher production elsewhere but the market is tightening and all it would take is one more shock to supply and oil could reach 100 read also asian shares rise on strong u s gdp eyes on fed china 3 how will iran and trump impact the market an upending of global oil trade around the iran trump spat could continue to have a sizable impact on financial markets as the affected supply is as much as 800 000 barrels a day uncertainties around availability have already whipsawed oil markets and the political sensitivities of these developments have other markets bracing for volatility trump has pledged to help alongside saudi arabia and the u a e those needing to shift orders from iran to another supplier but u s claims that its domestic supply can help offset the loss are a high bar to meet given that the daily american output for similar crude is about a quarter of iran s 4 who wins from higher oil prices emerging economies dominate the list of oil producing nations which is why they re affected more than developed ones the increase in revenues will help to repair budgets and current account deficits allowing governments to increase spending that will spur investment winners include saudi arabia russia norway nigeria and ecuador according to analysis by nomura 5 who loses those emerging economies nursing current account and fiscal deficits run the risk of large capital outflows and weaker currencies which in turn would spark inflation that in turn will force governments and central banks to weigh up their options hike interest rates even as growth slows or ride it out and risk capital flight nomura s losers list includes turkey ukraine and india 6 what does it mean for the the world s biggest economy while u s oil producers try to take advantage of any sales boost from customers moving away from iran the broader u s economy won t necessarily see benefits with oil price tags as high as 100 a barrel it would be a squeeze on american consumers that are the backbone of still steady economic growth prices at the gas pump already have risen 6 3 percent this month to 2 87 a gallon which could weigh on retail sales that jumped in march by the most since 2017 and if things go awry in global oil markets there s risk that political blame shifts back to the u s for the sanctions which could mean backlash via investment or other channels that threatens economic stability 7 will it lead to higher inflation around the world because energy features prominently in consumer price gauges policy makers look to core indexes that remove volatile components if the run up in prices proves to be substantial and sustained those costs will filter through to transportation and utilities 8 what does it mean for central banks led by the federal reserve central banks around the world have taken a dovish tilt as the absence of inflation allows policy makers to shift their focus to slowing growth that s unlikely to quickly change the international monetary fund this month lowered its global growth forecast and said the world is in a delicate moment

of course brexit is the process by which the u k is supposed to leave the european union robert berwick an accountant for the cpa firm s g from greenwich connecticut has provided quite a bit of information about how brexit will likely affect the u s economy based on his experience over the years with both perrier and heineken s u s branches brexit three years after the u k voters decided to leave the e u is still an unclear and muddled process the march 29 deadline this year for the u k s departure has come and gone and the u k has secured an extension in negotiations until april 12 parliament refuses to ratify prime minister theresa may s negotiated deal with the e u the reasons for parliament s refusal to ratify the negotiated brexit show how incredibly fractured parliament is brexiteer m p s do not consider may s deal to really be brexit at all and fear that it gives the sovereignty of the country to the e u other m p s who voted against may s deal are remainers and don t support brexit in any form in the wake of the march 29 deadline parliament took six separate votes and could not decide upon any alternative to may s soft brexit this leaves the u k in turmoil because the brexit date has come and gone now the government is on an extension of the negotiation process with the e u until april 12 as berwick explains there are still a few viable options for brexit to occur each one has different consequences for the u k and u s economies a second referendum one option that kept being proposed is that the voters be given a chance to vote again on brexit it is clear that this option is dangerous because many voters in the u k are very angry with may and parliament even those who are remainers they feel their wishes have not been supported at press time it appears the possibility of a second referendum has mostly been quashed for now this is likely because politicians fear the wrath of the voters there have been many demonstrations in the u k about this very issue potential effects on the u s economy of a second referendum berwick believes the consequences on the u s economy of a second referendum are dependent upon what the voters do in response to being required to vote again one dangerous event that could have larger repercussions in the u s would be civil unrest more on that below some version of soft brexit soft brexit plans tend to keep the u k trading in a customs union with the e u potential effects on the u s economy of a soft brexit berwick explains many companies in the u s have set up a headquarters in the uk so they can take advantage of being a part of the eurozone berwick believes that a soft brexit would allow u s companies to continue to have a presence in the e u trading block if the u k stayed within the trading block their economy would likely only contract about 2 2 percent so there would likely be little effect on the u s economy no deal brexit a hard brexit means the u k simply take their marbles all of them and leave the e u this would involve no payments made to the e u and would have the u k trade with the e u post brexit using the world trade organization wto agreements from the past potential effects on the u s economy of a no deal brexit berwick has consulted prognostications of the effects on the u s economy of a hard brexit with the u k outside of the e u under wto trade regulations it is predicted that the u k economy would decline by around 9 percent over the next 15 years since the u s is a major exporter to the u k there would be a decrease in u s exports also the u k would be less inclined to spend more money on their military budget some of which would be armaments from the u s the u k defense spending has already decreased to only 2 percent of their gdp a decline in the pound in relation to the dollar could also reduce some exports from the u s to the u k if by leaving the e u the u k began to lose its place as a main financial center in the world berwick believes that new york city would begin to take up some of that slack there have been on going talks between the u k and the u s over strengthening ties between the two financial centers and becoming one large financial block that leads the world into a future of cryptocurrency a general election it appears that the u k is headed for a general election since may and the tories cannot swing the brexit deal in any way that unifies parliament berwick states that it is likely at this point in a very fluid situation that jeremy corbyn the opposition leader of the labour party could win a general election if so he would likely be able to secure more time for negotiating brexit because a new party would be in power potential effects on the u s economy of a general election that delays brexit see below about the dangers of brexit delays berwick also adds that corbyn were he to become the prime minister has already made statements in the past that hamper his ability to be able to negotiate any other kind of brexit than may has with the e u it is possible that the e u will not accept any further negotiation from a corbyn government this may leave the u k stuck inside of the e u with absolutely no decision making power whatsoever this is the hotel california dilemma civil unrest as mentioned above although not the odds on favorite outcome there is a possibility of violent civil unrest in both france and england the majority of the french people are fed up with their government and its austerity measures which seem to be taxing and shrinking the middle class this is far beyond just the gas tax issue that has been reported in the mainstream news media in the u k the messy brexit process in which many people from outside of london feel betrayed that their wishes are not being carried out has hardened many people against may and the majority of parliament there is the possibility that these resentments could boil over and spill into the streets potential effects on the u s economy of a violent unrest in the u k berwick explains that since the u s is a major exporter to the u k civil war or any facsimile thereof would disrupt the u k s economy and stifle exports coming in from the u s this would be the worst case scenario of the brexit situation obviously such effects cannot be predicted but they would be far greater than the 9 percent lessening of the u k economy economists predict for a hard brexit this would have a negative impact upon companies who have set up headquarters in the u k to trade with the e u delay is one of the worst scenarios berwick states that delay is also not a good situation for the u s economy delay causes uncertainty in the financial markets 1 1 million u s jobs are directly tied to u k trade and financial investing in the uncertainty over brexit delays the u k economy contracted 1 3 percent in 2018 and the pound is 14 percent lower than it was before the referendum thus delay which could be caused by a general election or may asking for and receiving more extensions on negotiations is likely to affect the u s economy by virtue of the u k economy contracting and the u k importing less u s goods also the delay will result in uncertainty by virtue of businesses investing less in the u k american businesses have been investing in the u k and setting up headquarters there to be able to trade in the eurozone u s businesses are already beginning to incur higher costs to stay on top of the fluid situation between the u k and the e u conclusion robert berwick a cpa in greenwich connecticut makes it clear that delay one of the worst possible scenarios is likely to rule the day in the unfolding of brexit the impact upon the u s economy will be that companies will face uncertainty if they have or hope to have offices in london to trade in the e u likely the british economy will experience some shrinkage even though they are remaining within the e u for now so u s exports to the u k will likely experience some loss joint work towards creating a financial block with cryptocurrency will likely be put on hold until after the dust settles on what will become of brexit finally defense spending will continue to stay flat for now

within the kazakh bank sector while tcs increased its loan book 53 in 2018 the fund s other top positions during march were liberty bank kaz minerals sberbank prefs centerra gold central asia metals kaztransoil yandex and georgia healthcare of note the fund applied a 30 price discount to its stake in liberty bank due to the lack of progress in the ongoing court case which has tied up its shares sturgeon tendered its liberty bank shares after it was acquired by a third party but the court froze those shares on the last day of the tender offer the case is related to a 2009 acquisition which occurred years before the fund ever bought shares kazakh politics in their march newsletter which was reviewed by valuewalk the sturgeon team outlined significant events in kazakhstan and turkey kazakh markets clearly reacted positively to the nation s political news rumors about president nursultan nazarbayev s declining health has been the elephant in the room there so investors seemed pleased to see progress he resigned in march after having been president since 1991 when the nation became independent although his departure does create some uncertainty he will remain highly involved in kazakh politics as head of the national security council and of the ruling party he also will retain the official title of leader of the nation and sturgeon expects the economic stability kazakhstan has enjoyed under his leadership to continue as of march kazakhstan was the second largest allocation in the fund s portfolio at 25 followed by georgia with a 19 allocation russia was the top allocation at 27 turkish selloff march was an especially difficult month for the fund s turkish holdings the sturgeon team explained that the pullback in the lira and turkish stocks was due to the central bank s decision to suspend the weekly repo auctions that move essentially boosted interest rates and served as a shock to the market which perceived it as a sign that pressure on the lira will be increasing the turkish lira plunged 5 just on march 22 alone the central bank attempted to fight back by raising the try swap rates which boosted the currency sharply however availability of the lira was limited which resulted in a selloff in the nation s stock market which were a funding source for try liquidity according to sturgeon the fund s management warned that although the central bank was able to limit the devaluation in the long run an unorthodox monetary policy such as that will cause investors to be less trusting of the its policies sturgeon was able to slash its exposure to turkey in half before the extreme turbulence hit the market the fund cut its allocation to the nation from over 10 at the beginning of the year to under 5 now turkey was a notable contributor to the fund s november returns biggest winners and losers for sturgeon capital the sturgeon team highlighted halyk bank sberbank prefs and globaltrans as the fund s biggest winners in march all three stocks benefited from positive responses to their respective earnings results globaltrans also announced an implied dividend yield of more than 10 and is targeting a similar payout for the first half of this year the fund s biggest losers during the month were turquoise hill resources coca cola icecek and altyn turquoise hill s stock was weak despite the company s solid earnings results due to

economists in milan and london are debating whether italy is carrying so much debt that it might collapse into a greek style financial crisis their fear is that because italy is so much bigger than greece and because italy is one of the big three economies underpinning the eurozone that the scale of such a crisis might be more difficult to contain this time around it also underscores the un resolvable contradiction at the heart of the european central bank which governs the 19 countries that use the euro as a currency once a country gets into too much debt european union austerity rules that limit government spending militate to reduce that country s economic growth advertisement at the same time the ecb s rules make it impossible for a country to exit the euro without plunging itself into the financial crisis it is seeking to avoid italys economy is essentially going to flatline in the medium term italy has gone into recession and it does not look like it will rebound anytime soon gdp shrank in q1 2019 by 0 1 it declined by the same amount in q4 2018 the european union s fiscal responsibility rules prevent italy from expanding its government spending deficit beyond 2 04 of gdp even though extra government spending right now might boost the economy the italian economy is also burdened by a number of cultural and historic factors corruption and inflexible labour market rules to name just two that hold back its productivity growth these analysts say advertisement capital economics thus italy looks like it may become stuck in a state of perma recession according to jack allen an analyst at capital economics italy s economy is essentially going to flatline in the medium term he told business insider at the same time italy s debt load is rising it currently stands at about 2 trillion 2 25 trillion debt to gdp has reached 130 a level not seen since world war ii the public debt ratio will probably continue rising and eventually prove unsustainable allen said advertisement this would be a bigger problem than the previous euro zone crisis and could once again endanger the single currency itself he told clients recently ecb italys debt poses a much bigger systemic risk for the euro zone as a whole john higgins and adam hoyes two economist colleagues of allen s at capital economics agree the imf voiced concerns about the country s high level of debt and the risk of that triggering another euro zone sovereign debt crisis admittedly greece s government debt as a percentage of gdp is even higher than that of italy advertisement but unlike italy s greece s debt to gdp ratio is on a downward trajectory and its debt has been restructured under far more favorable terms than italy s what s more italy s debt is much larger in absolute terms and poses a much bigger systemic risk for the euro zone as a whole they said in a research note recently italy is stuck inside a downward debt growth cycle according to milan based nicola nobile an analyst at oxford economics the government is very likely to miss the fiscal targets agreed with the european commission at the end of last year 2 of gdp for 2019 and 1 8 for 2020 he told clients recently italy s banks hold a high ratio of domestic government debt if investors believe either the banks or the government cannot sustain that debt a national default becomes a real risk advertisement this bad equilibrium is very fragile this bad equilibrium is very fragile the main wildcard remains the political environment as we do not see the government surviving its five year term the other wildcard is a financial crisis if markets confidence in italy deteriorates quickly a financial crisis that brings down the current government could lead to a new unity government which implements fiscal tightening further depressing growth nobile says this situation cannot last capital s allen lays out this analysis of italy s problems extremely low productivity growth in part because italy has not invested in technology the way the us or the uk has in 2017 only 61 of italians were on the internet compared to 95 in uk according to the world bank the italian labour force is shrinking and immigration won t make up the difference italy is a haven for lousy management and corporate governance according to the wef global competitiveness report there is more government corruption in italy than other european economies and the italian legal system is slow to enforce or defend the rights of litigants italian companies still have weak access to credit and capital rigid labour market rules make companies afraid to hire people they can t get rid of later the quantity and quality of education is too low italian 15 year olds perform below the average tracked by the oecd poorly educated workers tend to be less productive advertisement capital economics in addition nobile says the limited deficit spending headroom that italy is allowed has been spent on the wrong projects for instance the eu allowed the government a little extra spending room last year and the government put 10 billion into early retirement benefits and a basic income scheme those might be good for unemployed people and pensioners but they aren t the kind of capital or educational investments that italy needs to restructure its economy for growth he says italians were richer than americans until they switched to the euro italy was not always this way advertisement in the 1980s and 1990s italians were richer on a purchasing power parity basis than americans they managed that because italy used the lira and the currency was competitively devalued it made italian goods and services cheap and spurred growth capital economics now italy uses the euro and it cannot devalue its currency the country could only do that if it left the eurozone and reinstated the lira unfortunately italy s obligations inside the ecb s euro transaction clearing system are approaching 500 billion according to the ecb technically that is debt italy must pay immediately if it defaults out of the euro it is the equivalent of about a third of italian gdp so that situation is extremely unlikely advertisement italy s problems are so intractable and so big that analysts are theorizing about what it would take to break up the eurozone it s an outside chance the possibility of italy leaving the eurozone is 5 or less nobile told business insider but he estimates the chance of a greek style financial crisis at 25 to 30 italy is several orders of magnitude bigger than greece i think it would be more difficult to contain the contagion the crisis has been a long time coming of course so haven t banks made sure to reduce their exposure to italian debt one of the reasons the greek crisis was largely confined to greece was because the private finance sphere successfully insulated itself from exposure to greek debt advertisement italy is several orders of magnitude bigger than greece allen told business insider i think it would be more difficult to contain the contagion read more about the italian debt crisis see also
overview restrictions are there any restrictions on the establishment of a business entity by a foreign licensor or a joint venture involving a foreign licensor and are there any restrictions against a foreign licensor entering into a licence agreement without establishing a subsidiary or branch office whether or not any such restrictions exist is there any filing or regulatory review process required before a foreign licensor can establish a business entity or joint venture in your jurisdiction the united kingdom does not have restrictions on foreign persons or entities being shareholders in uk corporate entities or participating in joint ventures subject to any international sanctions that may be in place foreign entities will often license into or take part in a joint venture in the united kingdom without establishing a branch office or subsidiary in the united kingdom this may be subject to some limitations depending upon the industry and other places of business of that foreign entity for example eu pharmaceutical regulations require that a company has a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance based in the european union foreign licensors may establish their own subsidiary entities governed by uk legislation such as private limited companies using the standard uk processes alternatively a foreign entity may establish business operations in the united kingdom in its own right provided that it registers as an overseas company with companies house the uk body responsible for administering companies within one month of opening for business this registration is done by completing a form titled os in01 and paying a small fee certain businesses may also require operating licences depending upon their field of industry kinds of licences forms of licence arrangement identify the different forms of licence arrangements that exist in your jurisdiction the united kingdom does not have a specific piece of licensing legislation however various intellectual property ip statutes patents act 1977 pa copyright designs and patents act 1988 cdpa and trade marks act 1994 tma contain rules governing at least part of the licensing of those rights the scope and complexity of licensing under english law often exceeds the simpler bounds contemplated by this legislation and there is a substantial body of english common law clarifying these rights common licence types include the following technology transfer licensing and its sub types patent and know how licensing such licences are highly fact specific and can perform multiple functions such as governing intra group know how transfers in a tax efficient manner governing the input and outcomes of joint r d projects or direct licensing of ip for manufacturing or sales purposes within a jurisdiction depending upon the parties and ip involved uk and eu competition law may be a consideration software licences these are increasingly prevalent given the growth of the uk information technology it services economy again the scope and purpose vary considerably on the matter at hand licences to a generic software tool are often granted by developers in perpetuity for a fixed fee though these licences will often not govern future software upgrades by the developer or warrant as to coverage licences for bespoke software tools or software development will often be considerably more complex and contain carefully delineated ip right ipr transfers or exchanges trademarks these are often licensed as between various parties in a supply chain for example from a manufacturing licensor to a distributing licensee or a holding licensor to a licensee that may manufacture and distribute trademark and brand licensing are also a significant intra group tool for value transfers where the licensor and licensee are not part of a group royalty and quality control provisions will typically be exacting the united kingdom also has limited compulsory licensing and licences of right for example in order to prevent the abuse of monopolies of functional designs section 237 1 of cdpa 1988 provides for any person to obtain a licence to do any act that would infringe an unregistered design right in the last five years of that design right s term if the parties cannot agree to the terms of such a licence then the terms will be settled by the comptroller of patents designs and trade marks although the cdpa contains no guidance for the comptroller eu regulation also requires compulsory licensing of patents relating to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products to countries with public health problems the above paragraphs are not exhaustive and there is a wide variety of possible licensing arrangements under english law these include for example licences for domain names plant varieties registered and unregistered designs and other ipr law affecting international licensing creation of international licensing relationship does legislation directly govern the creation or otherwise regulate the terms of an international licensing relationship describe any such requirements depending upon the parties and rights involved in the licence the legislation most likely to impact an international licensing relationship will be united kingdom and eu competition laws particularly article 101 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu and the technology transfer block exemption regulation ttber and its accompanying guidelines the ttber restricts the use of certain licensing terms notably passive sales restrictions other than in jurisdictions with exclusive licensees and automatic assignments or exclusive licences of improvements developed by a licensee to the licensor the tfeu is concerned with anticompetitive behaviour more generally and seeks to regulate the relationship between competitors suppliers and customers these laws can be used to prevent dominant parties forcing others into perpetual licences or manipulating markets by contracting with anticompetitive royalty rates or minimum supply requirements from a given supplier see question 28 the united kingdom has no legislation requiring that products must be purchased locally or any equivalent provisions pre contractual disclosure what pre contractual disclosure must a licensor make to prospective licensees are there any requirements to register a grant of international licensing rights with authorities in your jurisdiction there are no formal requirements for pre contractual disclosure in the united kingdom subject to the transaction and resources at hand parties may wish to agree upon a due diligence process similar to that for a corporate acquisition however for many small scale licences such as generic software licences this is neither feasible nor necessary licensors should be aware of the impact of inducing a licensee to enter into an agreement by misrepresentation which can lead to rescission of the contract or a payment in damages to the licensee silence may constitute misrepresentation in some circumstances and accordingly a licensor may wish to make some limited disclosure or include some level of warranty in any licence there are no requirements to register licences to confirm their validity however it is advisable to register exclusive patent licences and any trademark licence with the uk intellectual property office uk ipo european patent office epo only european patent applications may be registered licences to granted european patents can registered in the national patent offices or trade marks registry as applicable licensees are only granted certain rights in the event of prompt registration for example an exclusive patent licensee must register the grant of the licence within six months if it wishes to claim costs of an infringement action that are attributable to infringements pre dating the registration for patent and trademark licences registration is important to give notice to third parties without registration the licence will be ineffective against a party acquiring a subsequent interest in the patent or trademark without actual knowledge of the licence registration are there any statutorily or court imposed implicit obligations in your jurisdiction that may affect an international licensing relationship such as good faith or fair dealing obligations the obligation to act reasonably in the exercise of rights or requiring good cause for termination or non renewal commercial entities contracting in the united kingdom are able to agree to such terms as they wish provided that the agreement is freely entered into by all the parties while the position is not entirely settled english courts have typically been reluctant to imply general good faith obligations into contracts the courts have a limited discretion to imply terms into agreements where such a term is required to give business efficacy to an agreement or is obvious to both parties to have been a term at the time of formation however the courts will not intervene to resolve a bad bargain where both parties have freely entered into the agreement to the ultimate detriment of one or both termination is similarly subject to the agreement reached between the parties and may be unilateral and without cause if the parties will agree it however where an agreement is silent on both its term and termination the courts will imply a term that an agreement is terminable on reasonable notice though reasonableness will be judged on the facts at hand rather than a statutory standard there is also no obligation that a party must have good cause for non renewal intellectual property issues paris convention is your jurisdiction party to the paris convention for the protection of industrial property the patent cooperation treaty pct the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips the united kingdom is party to the paris convention 1883 in force since 1884 the patent cooperation treaty 1970 in force since 1978 and the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights 1994 in force since 1995 on a pan european point the european union s long delayed unitary patent package legislation which will ultimately create a unitary patent right and a unified patent court upc for europe currently features the united kingdom as a signatory the uk government has also ratified the upc agreement and existing european patents will be subject to the jurisdiction of the upc however the ultimate scope of the united kingdom s long term involvement in the upc remains uncertain in light of the brexit vote the british government has expressed an intention to seek to remain as part of the upc even in the event that no deal is reached with the european union following brexit negotiations but it remains to be seen whether that will be possible contesting validity can the licensee be contractually prohibited from contesting the validity of a foreign licensor s intellectual property rights or registrations in your jurisdiction there is no outright prohibition on non challenge clauses however licensors should be wary of being seen to restrict competition or restrain trade under article 101 of the tfeu the ttber and its guidelines provide a competition framework for patent know how and copyright agreements by way of a block exemption to article 101 under article 5 1 b of the ttber non challenge clauses relating to eu ipr in non exclusive licence agreements will not benefit from the block exemption and will be subject to article 101 however non challenge clauses in exclusive licence agreements are protected under the block exemption paragraph 134 of the guidelines explains the proviso as follows the reason for excluding non challenge clauses from the scope of the block exemption is the fact that licensees are normally in the best position to determine whether or not an intellectual property right is invalid in the interest of undistorted competition and in accordance with the principles underlying the protection of intellectual property invalid intellectual property rights should be eliminated invalid intellectual property stifles innovation rather than promoting it the european commission views non challenge clauses as typically acceptable in the context of settlement agreements although with the proviso that the no challenge should only be induced by a licence to the right in question invalidity or expiry what is the effect of the invalidity or expiry of registration of an intellectual property right on a related licence agreement in your jurisdiction if the licence remains in effect can royalties continue to be levied if the licence does not remain in effect can the licensee freely compete typically it will be a term of an ip licence that it will terminate in line with the expiry or invalidity of the right in question however there are some nuances depending upon the right in question patent licensors should be aware of the impact of eu competition law because agreements that restrict the right of a licensee to compete against the licensor after the expiry of the patent will be in breach of this legislation similarly licences requiring indefinite payment of royalties or fees are likely to be in breach of competition law although an ongoing obligation for payment exceeding the term of the patent may be permissible where it pertains to either fair reward for the patent holder eg in research patents which may not ultimately bear fruit during their term although their exploitation may be instrumental to any eventual commercial outcome or is in relation to know how associated with the patent trademark licensors may wish to be careful about accepting termination on the invalidation of a trademark as the trademark may retain value as an unregistered trademark with its attendant goodwill should a licence not provide for expiry on the invalidation of the trademark a licensee would need to demonstrate that the invalidity of the trademark was a repudiatory breach of the licence or that the maintenance of that trademark was a condition of the agreement in order to terminate various unregistered rights such as copyright and design rights will expire over time and agreements pertaining to such rights should take this into account in much the same way as they would otherwise pertain to expiry of registration requirements specific to foreigners is an original registration or evidence of use in the jurisdiction of origin or any other requirements unique to foreigners necessary prior to the registration of intellectual property in your jurisdiction the united kingdom has no special requirements for the registration of ipr owned by foreigners or for the registration of ipr originating in another jurisdiction the registration of ipr originating outside or held by entities based outside the united kingdom should follow the united kingdom s standard registration processes unregistered rights can unregistered trademarks or other intellectual property rights that are not registered be licensed in your jurisdiction an unregistered right may be licensed or assigned to the extent that it can be defined in such a way as to grant sufficient certainty as to the scope of that property right unregistered trademarks are not uncommon in the united kingdom and are often licensed because they are easily delineated and can be protected under the common law tort of passing off thereby giving a licensee comfort as to the value of its licence similarly licences of registered trademarks will typically incorporate reference to the attendant unregistered rights associated with that trademark such as any goodwill accrued to it future or potential rights can be licensed prospectively security interests are there particular requirements in your jurisdiction to take a security interest in intellectual property ipr are property rights and are therefore capable of being subject to the usual security interests under english law there are no requirements unique to the securitisation of ip which may be mortgaged or subject to fixed or floating charges in the usual manner proceedings against third parties can a foreign owner or licensor of intellectual property institute proceedings against a third party for infringement in your jurisdiction without joining the licensee from your jurisdiction as a party to the proceedings can an intellectual property licensee in your jurisdiction institute proceedings against an infringer of the licensed intellectual property without the consent of the owner or licensor can the licensee be contractually prohibited from doing so subject to the provisions of any licensing agreement there is nothing in uk legislation to restrict a foreign owner or licensor from commencing proceedings without joining the uk licensee there is also nothing to prevent a licensee from initiating proceedings without the consent of the owner or licensor subject to the licensee having standing to issue the proceedings the position in respect of patents is prescribed by legislation under section 67 of pa 1977 a licensee may only bring proceedings in respect of a patent to which it is the exclusive licensee and in the event that it does so the patentee must either be joined as a claimant or if it is unwilling to do so as a defendant provided that if the patentee does not enter an appearance as defendant it shall have no liability in costs an exclusive licensee under section 67 of pa 1977 may be awarded damages or other relief recent case law has clarified that an exclusive licence that is subject to the right of a third party to request a non exclusive licence remains an exclusive licence for the purposes of section 67 of pa 1977 until the third party exercises its right section 46 of pa 1977 provides that a licensee under a licence of right may require a patentee to issue proceedings to prevent infringement and if the patentee does not do so within two months may commence proceedings itself joining the patentee as a defendant though without cost liabilities unless entering an appearance a licensee may be prohibited from exercising the above rights by agreement with the licensor the tma sets out similar provisions in respect of trademarks section 31 of tma 1994 provides that where an exclusive trademark licence states that the licensee has the same rights as if the licence had been an assignment the licensee shall be able to bring proceedings in its own name where the exclusive licensee and proprietor of the trademark have a concurrent right to bring infringement proceedings they can both sue but must both be made parties to protect a defendant from being sued twice for the same infringement where the proprietor is joined as a defendant to proceedings they will not be liable for costs unless they take part in the proceedings the obligation to join the proprietor or exclusive licensee and the proprietor s ability to avoid liability for costs can be contracted out of by the proprietor and the exclusive licensee for non exclusive trademark licensees and exclusive licensees where the licence does not grant a right to bring an action in the licensee s name section 30 of tma 1994 entitles the licensee to call on the proprietor to take infringement proceedings in respect of any matter which affects the licensee s interests unless the licence excludes this right if the proprietor refuses to bring proceedings or fails to do so within two months of being requested the licensee may bring proceedings in its own name once again the proprietor must be joined as a party to the proceedings and if added as a defendant is not liable for costs unless they take part in the proceedings sub licensing can a trademark or service mark licensee in your jurisdiction sub license use of the mark to a third party if so does the right to sub license exist statutorily or must it be granted contractually if it exists statutorily can the licensee validly waive its right to sub license there is no statutory right to sub license in uk legislation and both section 30 4 of pa 1977 and section 28 4 of tma 1994 refer to sub licences being grantable only so far as is provided for in the relevant head licence the cdpa is silent on rules for sub licensing copyright but in light of the above it is likely that no such right will be implied unless specifically contemplated within the head licence licences should in any event deal expressly with sub licensing rights to avoid later dispute or inference for instance where a licence is to all the rights under the patent jointly owned intellectual property if intellectual property in your jurisdiction is jointly owned is each co owner free to deal with that intellectual property as it wishes without the consent of the other co owners are co owners of intellectual property rights able to change this position in a contract in contrast to many other jurisdictions such as the united states in the united kingdom co owners of ip are significantly restricted in the way they can deal with and exploit co owned ip without the consent of the other co owner or owners pursuant to section 16 2 and 173 2 of cdpa 1988 in the united kingdom a joint owner of copyright cannot license or exploit a copyright work without the consent of the other joint owner where a jointly owned right has been licensed by one owner the other non licensing owner would be free to sue for infringement the cdpa does not expressly deal with assignment of jointly owned copyright although it has been asserted academically that this is possible with the assignee stepping into the shoes of the assignor and taking the copyright ownership as tenant in common this uncertainty regarding assignment can be dealt with expressly between the parties by contract in respect of patents the pa provides that patents may be jointly owned and each patent owner will be free to work the patent for him or herself however section 36 3 of pa 1977 provides that a joint owner of a patent may not without the consent of all other joint owners grant a licence under the patent assign his or her share of the patent mortgage his or her share in the patent or amend the patent specification or apply for an amendment the ability for a co owner to exploit the patent is therefore significantly limited again this may be varied by contractual agreement between the parties a similar position exists in respect of trademarks under the tma co owners of trademarks may exploit the mark themselves without the consent of the other co owners but may not license assign or charge the mark without consent broadly speaking the above statutory positions can be varied by express agreement between the parties in a contract however practical and drafting difficulties may often arise in trying to foresee and provide for any possible permutation of future exploitation by each of the parties first to file is your jurisdiction a first to file or first to invent jurisdiction can a foreign licensor license the use of an invention subject to a patent application but in respect of which the patent has not been issued in your jurisdiction the united kingdom is a first to file jurisdiction patent applications are considered personal property under section 30 pa and accordingly grants of rights may be made out of them scope of patent protection can the following be protected by patents in your jurisdiction software business processes or methods living organisms software while software is an excluded and non patentable category under section 1 2 c of pa 1977 uk case law is pulling away from the certainty of this because the courts have considered whether the software creates a meaningful technical effect the ipo has issued guidance based primarily upon the judgments in aerotel limited v telco holdings ltd and ors symbian limited v the controller of patents and htc europe co ltd v apple inc indicating that where software meets certain signposted criteria around technical effect it will be patentable subject to the other usual requirements additionally computer code as well as the images text video and sound present in any user interface of the software may be protected by copyright and databases within software may be protected by database rights business methods business methods are similarly excluded from patent protection under section 1 2 c of pa 1977 however they are subject to the same ipo guidance as software and in the wake of aerotel business methods have been found to be patentable where they have a demonstrable technical effect above and beyond their methodology living organisms the biotechnology directive directive 98 44 ec as implemented in schedule a2 of pa 1977 states that a biological product or a process relating to biological material may be patented subject to several exceptions within the field these include any inventions pertaining to the human body cloning and any industrial or commercial use of human embryos trade secrets and know how is there specific legislation in your jurisdiction that governs trade secrets or know how if so is there a legal definition of trade secrets or know how in either case how are trade secrets and know how treated by the courts on 9 june 2018 the united kingdom implemented the trade secrets directive 2016 244 eu that harmonises trade secret protection throughout the european union information is a trade secret if it is secret has commercial value because it is secret and has been subject to reasonable steps to keep it secret trade secrets and know how can also be effectively protected under the united kingdom s law of confidence a common law doctrine trade secrets can be protected if it can be established that the information has the necessary quality of confidence and that anyone with access to the information owes its owner a duty of confidence it is not a requirement that a given recipient enters into a non disclosure agreement although it is indicative of a relationship of confidence if a recipient then discloses that information in breach of that confidence legal action can be taken by the owner trade secret owners may bring claims under the common law for breach of confidence or misuse of confidential information in addition to or as an alternative to a claim under the implementation of the trade secrets directive parties will often enter into agreements when transferring trade secrets or know how between each other for any purpose expressly protecting the use and handling of the information and setting out the indemnities in respect of their loss or misuse it is also common in such agreements to include an express reference granting the right to seek an injunction as first recourse in the event that the information is lost or misused the courts have been willing to grant injunctions in recognition of the importance of trade secrets under english law trade secrets know how and confidential information are not classed as property as such accordingly rights in the same are enforced under the laws of tort rather than property does the law allow a licensor to restrict disclosure or use of trade secrets and know how by the licensee or third parties in your jurisdiction both during and after the term of the licence agreement is there any distinction to be made with respect to improvements to which the licensee may have contributed parties are free to contract so as to restrict the disclosure of trade secrets to third parties and will ordinarily do so confidentiality provisions will typically be drafted to survive the agreement and be severable as disclosing parties will wish to protect their trade secrets indefinitely rather than just for the term of a given licence any loss of confidentiality in the future will limit the capacity of the disclosing party to monetise that information going forward parties are similarly free to contract with respect to the confidentiality and other rights associated with any follow on work or improvements that a licensee might make but should be aware of competition law restrictions on exclusive grant backs of ipr see question 27 copyright what constitutes copyright in your jurisdiction and how can it be protected uk copyright law is set out in cdpa 1988 although works published before that date will be subject to the law in place at the time of their creation the copyright act 1956 and the copyright act 1911 although there is some nuance in the application generally a work that is original and permanent ie has been recorded in some way will be automatically protected by copyright provided that it falls within one of the following categories literary dramatic musical or artistic works sound recordings films broadcasts or cable programmes typographical arrangements of published editions and databases copyright protection lasts for 70 years from the end of the year in which the last creator of the work dies though for some of the above categories the period is shorter although there are no publication or registration requirements for uk copyright it is advisable to maintain a record of a work s creation should ownership disputes arise software licensing perpetual software licences does the law in your jurisdiction recognise the validity of perpetual software licences if not or if it is not advisable for other reasons are there other means of addressing concerns relating to perpetual licences parties to agreements in the united kingdom are free to contract for any term that they wish subject to competition rules there is therefore no bar to a perpetual licence but to ensure the functioning of the licence in practice parties should contract clearly that the licence is in perpetuity and also directly address termination in bms computer solutions v ab agri ltd the courts held a perpetual licence to be terminable on its true construction including by reference to its construction in relation to other related agreements between the parties practically speaking software has a limited lifespan relative to the copyright protection it is entitled to and accordingly parties are unlikely to come upon issues of enforceability owing to duration and competition requirements legal requirements are there any legal requirements to be complied with prior to granting software licences including import or export restrictions as software can be protected by copyright an exclusive licence to a piece of software should be in writing and signed by or on behalf of the copyright owner this is typically the licensing entity but copyright ownership should be checked in advance of entering into any licence beyond this there are no bespoke requirements pertaining to software licensing the united kingdom has some export restrictions primarily in relation to military goods the list of restricted goods which can include software is published as the uk strategic export control list software is unlikely to be restricted at import however importers should be aware that imported goods infringing ipr in the united kingdom may be detained restrictions on users are there any legal restrictions in your jurisdiction with respect to the restrictions a licensor can put on users of its software in a licence agreement it is permitted and indeed market practice in this jurisdiction for a software licensor to restrict the licensee from copying adapting reverse engineering decompiling disassembling or modifying the licensed software however this restriction is often caveated with the wording to the extent permitted by law or words to that effect this is because the cdpa provides that there are some rights available to a licensee that a licensor is not permitted to restrict including the right to decompile or effectively reverse engineer software if necessary in order for it to interoperate with another program the right to make a backup copy of the software if necessary for its lawful use and the right to observe study and test the functioning of the software in order to determine the principles and ideas that underlie it royalties and other payments currency conversion and taxes relevant legislation is there any legislation that governs the nature amount or manner or frequency of payments of royalties or other fees or costs including interest on late payments in an international licensing relationship or require regulatory approval of the royalty rate or other fees or costs including interest on late payments payable by a licensee in your jurisdiction the united kingdom does not place restrictions on or require approvals for payments in international licensing relationships unless the contract stipulates the interest rate and details how debts will be recovered the late payment of commercial debts interest act 1998 provides that in business to business contracts a creditor can claim interest at a rate of 8 per cent a year above the bank of england base rate on the price of goods or services plus a fixed sum and reasonable costs of recovering the debt whether or not the act applies to international agreements depends on the choice of law and whether there is a significant connection to the united kingdom restrictions are there any restrictions on transfer and remittance of currency in your jurisdiction are there are any associated regulatory reporting requirements there are no legal restrictions on capital flows to and from the united kingdom although persons carrying more than 10 000 or equivalent in cash cheque or bankers draft into or out of the european union must complete a cash declaration form with fines of up to 5 000 and seizure of the cash for a false or non declaration additionally the proceeds of crime act 2002 places reporting obligations on those who suspect money laundering and imposes liability on those involved in the handling of assets obtained from criminal conduct taxation of foreign licensor in what circumstances may a foreign licensor be taxed on its income in your jurisdiction in general non resident licensors are only subject to tax in the united kingdom on income that is attributable to a permanent establishment in the united kingdom of that licensor or to the extent that tax is required to be withheld by the licensee withholding tax is imposed on payments of royalties for a number of different types of ip including patent royalties copyrights trademarks and design rights there are certain reliefs from the duty to deduct tax the most common being where a double taxation treaty dtt concluded between the united kingdom and the jurisdiction in which the licensor is resident provides that the rate of withholding is to be reduced sometimes to as low as zero where no reduction in the rate of withholding tax is possible the rate of deduction is 20 per cent of the royalty if a licensor has suffered a withholding it may be able to claim credit for the uk tax withheld in its home jurisdiction either under local law or under the provisions of any applicable dtt from april 2019 withholding tax on royalties will also apply where a non uk entity without a permanent establishment in the united kingdom makes sales in the united kingdom and pays a royalty to a connected non uk party the change in legislation is aimed to capture uk sales made by large multinational technology companies who do not fall within the scope of the separate diverted profits tax competition law issues restrictions on trade are practices that potentially restrict trade prohibited or otherwise regulated in your jurisdiction practices that have as their object or effect the prevention restriction or distortion of competition within the european union and may affect trade between member states are prohibited by article 101 of the tfeu a similar prohibition applies to practices having an effect on trade within the united kingdom under chapter i of the competition act 1998 ca agreements or practices relating to price fixing output limitation market sharing resale price maintenance or absolute territorial protection are particularly likely to be caught by this prohibition however commercial agreements may contain other terms that affect competition such as exclusivity provisions or customer restrictions these need to be considered in their market context article 102 of the tfeu and chapter ii of ca 1998 similarly prohibit practices affecting trade that constitute an abuse of a dominant position this can include acts by a dominant company such as predatory pricing refusal to supply and tied selling serious infringements of these prohibitions carry heavy penalties agreements that infringe article 101 and the chapter i prohibition may be partly or wholly unenforceable such agreements can be investigated by the competition authorities in the united kingdom the competition and markets authority cma or the european commission and may also be the subject of private litigation legal restrictions are there any legal restrictions in respect of the following provisions in licence agreements duration exclusivity internet sales prohibitions non competition restrictions and grant back provisions the prohibitions outlined in question 26 can apply to licence agreements licences that comply with the terms of the ttber are deemed compliant with competition law licence agreements outside of the block exemption require fuller consideration with the assistance of the technology transfer guidelines the duration of a licence rarely leads to competition concerns in itself although it can be problematic where restrictions continue to apply to a licensee after a licensed right has expired exclusivity may be permitted depending on the market context a licensor can also generally prevent licensees from actively soliciting customers from other countries however if a licence confers absolute territorial protection it is likely to be found anticompetitive prohibitions in internet selling are treated as restrictions on passive sales and are usually prohibited although bans on third party platforms may be permitted in selective distribution systems case c 230 16 coty direct or indirect non compete obligations that last longer than five years are specifically excluded from the vertical agreements block exemption applicable to brand licences contained in distribution agreements licensors are not permitted to prevent licensees from exploiting their own technology but other non compete obligations are permitted under the ttber exclusive grant back provisions where the licensee is required to assign or license improvements back to the licensor on an exclusive basis are likely to breach competition law non exclusive grant backs are permitted under the ttber ip related court rulings have courts in your jurisdiction held that certain uses or abuses of intellectual property rights have been anticompetitive the united kingdom s competition regulator the cma has held in paroxetine case ce 9531 11 that patent settlement agreements that delay entry of a generic drug in return for value transfers a pay for delay deal breached the prohibition against anticompetitive agreements and amounted to an abuse of the patentee s dominant position gsk appealed the decision to the competition appeals tribunal which referred a number of questions to the court of justice of the european union cjeu in march 2018 judgment is pending similar decisions have been reached by the european commission and the general court of the european union these are currently binding on uk courts in case c 179 16 hoffmann la roche ltd roche the cjeu warned that entering into a licence agreement that complies with competition law does not justify later anticompetitive conduct connected to that licence certain patent life cycle management strategies in the pharmaceutical sector have also been held to be anticompetitive product hopping which encourages a switch from a product for which a patent is about to expire to a newly patented product with no generic alternatives has been held anticompetitive where the company recommending the switch intends to limit generic competition see reckitt benckiser case ca98 02 2011 in case c 170 13 huawei v zte the cjeu has held that in certain circumstances it may be anticompetitive for holders of standard essential patents that have committed to license those patents on fair reasonable and non discriminatory frand terms to seek injunctions against potential licensees in unwired planet v huawei ewhc 711 pat the english high court was willing to set a global frand rate and licence terms and impose an injunction for failure to accept those terms conversely a licensor who failed to grant a licence on terms established by the court to be frand would be refused an injunction the english court of appeal upheld this decision in october 2018 ewca civ 2344 indemnification disclaimers of liability damages and limitation of damages indemnification provisions are indemnification provisions commonly used in your jurisdiction and if so are they generally enforceable is insurance coverage for the protection of a foreign licensor available in support of an indemnification provision indemnities are generally enforceable and are commonly found in licence agreements as a way of mitigating losses without resorting to other principles of contract and tort which may be more difficult to prove such as causation insurance coverage is available for those providing indemnities and will be subject to the terms and conditions of the insurer waivers and limitations can the parties contractually agree to waive or limit certain types of damages are disclaimers and limitations of liability generally enforceable what are the exceptions if any parties will frequently waive or limit their liability and such limitations will generally be enforceable provided that they are seen as fair and reasonable under the unfair contract terms act 1977 ucta the test for fairness and reasonableness takes into account all the circumstances that were or that ought reasonably to have been known or in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made schedule 2 of ucta 1977 provides guidelines as to the application of the test and lists such factors as bargaining position and trade customs liability for death or personal injury as a result of negligence and liability for fraud cannot be limited under any circumstances termination right to terminate does the law impose conditions on or otherwise limit the right to terminate or not to renew an international licensing relationship or require the payment of an indemnity or other form of compensation upon termination or non renewal more specifically have courts in your jurisdiction extended to licensing relationships the application of commercial agency laws that contain such rights or remedies or provide such indemnities in england and wales the principle of freedom of contract also applies to the right to terminate without conditions or limitation subject to the terms of the contract itself wrongful termination may result in damages for breach of contract licensing relationships are not treated any differently in this respect compensation may be owing to a commercial agent under the commercial agents council directive regulations 1993 for termination of their continuing authority to negotiate a sale of purchase of goods on behalf of a principal consequently most international licensing contracts will be structured so as to avoid the licensee coming under the definition of commercial agent the english courts will only apply the laws of agency where there is an agreement that establishes an agent principal relationship ie where the agent is empowered to bind the principal as opposed to a mere licensing relationship see vlm holdings limited v ravensworth digital services limited impact of termination what is the impact of the termination or expiration of a licence agreement on any sub licence granted by the licensee in the absence of any contractual provision addressing this issue would a contractual provision addressing this issue be enforceable in either case without an agency relationship a sub licence will only be as good as the head licence however as the case of vlm holdings limited v ravensworth digital services limited has held if the court finds an agency relationship exists then the sub licence may not terminate on termination of the head licence the law in this area is subject to evolution to protect the parties positions ip owners should ensure that the effect of termination of a head licence is clearly stated with respect to any sub licences bankruptcy impact of licensee bankruptcy what is the impact of the bankruptcy of the licensee on the legal relationship with its licensor and any sub licence that the licensee may have granted can the licensor structure its international licence agreement to terminate it prior to the bankruptcy and remove the licensee s rights upon a licensee becoming insolvent an administrator will be appointed to take control of the licensee s assets the administrator will then decide how those assets should be distributed to ascertain as much value as possible for the licensee s creditors this is likely to include valuable assets such as licensed ipr it is common for licensors to structure licences to provide for express termination of the licence on administration or liquidation of the licensee in this way the licensor can protect valuable ip assets impact of licensor bankruptcy what is the impact of the bankruptcy of the licensor on the legal relationship with its licensee and any sub licence the licensee has granted are there any steps a licensee can take to protect its interest if the licensor becomes bankrupt where a licensor becomes insolvent the insolvency act 1986 ia does not trigger an automatic termination of the licence it is unlikely also that a licensee would have or indeed want a contractual right to terminate in these circumstances the ia does provide the option for the licensee to apply for an order to rescind the licence although in practice this is not likely to be desirable the licensee can put in place contractual provisions in the licence to protect itself from this situation including inserting a contractual right to buy the licensed ip on arm s length terms upon a triggering event pre the licensor s insolvency or providing that the licence will become perpetual and royalty free in the event of the licensor s insolvency both these options must be carefully considered so as to avoid the transaction being voided as a transaction at an undervalue under uk insolvency laws it is also advisable for a licensee of registered ip to record its licence at the relevant registries as this will protect its interest against a third party who may subsequently purchase the ip via a liquidator or other insolvency practitioner without knowledge of the licence see question 4 governing law and dispute resolution restrictions on governing law are there any restrictions on an international licensing arrangement being governed by the laws of another jurisdiction chosen by the parties it is common in international licensing agreements for the parties to choose a governing law of a jurisdiction other than their own there are no specific restrictions in this regard in relation to the united kingdom when drafting the governing law provisions the parties should take into account conflict of laws principles and mandatory laws contractual agreement to arbitration can the parties contractually agree to arbitration of their disputes instead of resorting to the courts of your jurisdiction if so must the arbitration proceedings be conducted in your jurisdiction or can they be held in another parties are free to agree to submit their disputes to arbitration alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are encouraged by the civil procedure rules which govern civil litigation in england and wales the parties may also agree to have the hearing conducted in a jurisdiction of their choosing when agreeing to arbitration of ip disputes the parties should carefully consider the varying forms of dispute that may occur to ensure that such a clause does not fall foul of public policy restrictions on the arbitrability of disputes in the united kingdom the validity of an ipr is arbitrable although the award will only bind the parties to the arbitration as the position on this varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the parties should ensure that this is taken into account in their governing law and jurisdiction clauses the most popular arbitral body or rules selected in respect of licensing arrangements are typically the london court of international arbitration or the world intellectual property organization arbitration rules with the most favoured seat being london there is no concept of collective arbitration in the united kingdom and the statute governing arbitration the arbitration act 1996 does not provide for a mechanism by which collective arbitration could proceed for this reason clauses excluding collective arbitration are not found in agreements governed by english law enforceability would a court judgment or arbitral award from another jurisdiction be enforceable in your jurisdiction is your jurisdiction party to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards foreign court judgments are generally enforceable in the united kingdom but are subject to different regimes depending on the jurisdiction from which the foreign judgment originates enforcement is most straightforward for judgments from eu member states iceland norway and switzerland because by virtue of its eu membership the united kingdom is subject to the provisions of council regulation eu no 1215 2012 the recast brussels regulation and the lugano convention these provisions will stop applying upon the united kingdom s exit from the european union in the event that a deal is not reached between the united kingdom and the european union that comprehensively addresses mutual enforcement of judgments it will remain open to the united kingdom to apply to join the lugano convention which is in broadly the same terms as the recast brussels regulation or any other international treaty for mutual enforcement the united kingdom is a party to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 accordingly foreign arbitral awards are ordinarily enforceable injunctive relief is injunctive relief available in your jurisdiction may it be waived contractually if so what conditions must be met for a contractual waiver to be enforceable may the parties waive their entitlement to claim specific categories of damages in an arbitration clause injunctive relief both interim and final is available and is a frequent feature in ip and licensing disputes an injunction is not available as a remedy of right and is only granted at the discretion of the court if it is just and convenient to grant such a relief provided that the ordinary conditions for a contract are met a party may waive its entitlement to claim specific heads of damages such as loss of profits and indirect losses or the availability of injunctive relief updates trends updates trends updates and trends in two recent cases the english courts have clarified what constitutes an exclusive patent licence for a licensee s right to bring patent infringement proceedings in its own name illumina inc ors v premaitha health plc ors ewhc 2930 pat and oxford nanopore technologies anor v pacific biosciences of california inc anor ewhc 3190 pat see question 12 an exclusive licence that is subject to the right of a third party to request a non exclusive licence as is commonly seen in licences where the patents are owned by academic institutions remains an exclusive licence until the third party exercises its right on the other hand a licence granted to a party and its affiliates cannot constitute an exclusive licence and drafting should instead provide for the licensee to grant sub licences to its affiliates in order to protect the statutory rights granted to exclusive licensees the 2017 first instance decision in unwired planet v huawei see question 28 which dealt with determining frand terms for sep licences was affirmed in 2018 by the court of appeal ewca civ 2344 the court of appeal s confirmation that the english courts can set global frand rates and licensing terms and grant injunctions for any arising patent infringement should reinforce the reputation of the english courts as a favoured location for sep litigation for global actors in the field of telecommunications in anticipation of the delayed introduction of the unitary patent and upc see question 6 parties to a licence agreement are advised to deal expressly with their respective rights and responsibilities during the transitional period as regards opting out any classical european patents that are the subject of the licence from the upc system and subsequently opting them back in these precautions remain prudent despite the uncertainties surrounding the united kingdom s involvement in the upc brought about by the brexit process ip licensing continues to be a popular business model in the united kingdom in particular in the life sciences sector increasingly the parties are entering into r d or collaboration arrangements as a precursor to or alongside or as part of a licence agreement in order to take what are becoming increasingly complex technologies from early stage through to industrial application licences between academic institutions and commercial companies and between large pharmaceutical organisations and small biotech companies are becoming very common and there is also now a notable increase in the number of transactions between pharmaceutical companies and traditional it and technology companies in the rapidly growing arena of digital health
surging crude prices are posing another headwind for the world economy after president donald trump s zero pledge on iran oil sales brent crude has risen about 40 percent this year and is at the highest in six months while higher prices due to strong demand typically reflects a robust world economy a shock from constrained supply is a negative much will depend on how sustained the spike proves to be exporting nations will enjoy a boost to corporate and government revenues while consuming nations will bear the cost at the pump potentially fanning inflation and hurting demand ultimately there comes a point where higher prices may be damaging to everyone 1 what does it mean for global growth the impact will vary rising oil prices will hurt household income and spending and it could accelerate inflation as the world s biggest importer of oil china is vulnerable and many countries in europe also rely on imported energy seasonal effects will also impact with the northern hemisphere summer approaching consumers can switch energy sources and scale back usage a slowing world economy will also hurt demand and by extension keep a lid on prices 2 how can the world economy absorb oil at 100 for a sustained hit to growth economists say oil would need to hold above 100 it also depends on dollar strength or weakness given crude is priced in greenbacks analysis by oxford economics found that brent at 100 per barrel by the end of 2019 means the level of global gross domestic product would be 0 6 percent lower than currently projected by end 2020 with inflation on average 0 7 percentage points higher we see increased risks of significantly higher oil prices oxford economists john payne and gabriel sterne wrote in a note in the short run it is likely the supply impact will be offset by higher production elsewhere but the market is tightening and all it would take is one more shock to supply and oil could reach 100 3 how will iran and trump impact the market an upending of global oil trade around the iran trump spat could continue to have a sizable impact on financial markets as the affected supply is as much as 800 000 barrels a day uncertainties around availability have already whipsawed oil markets and the political sensitivities of these developments have other markets bracing for volatility trump has pledged to help alongside saudi arabia and the u a e those needing to shift orders from iran to another supplier but u s claims that its domestic supply can help offset the loss are a high bar to meet given that the daily american output for similar crude is about a quarter of iran s 4 who wins from higher oil prices emerging economies dominate the list of oil producing nations which is why they re affected more than developed ones the increase in revenues will help to repair budgets and current account deficits allowing governments to increase spending that will spur investment winners include saudi arabia russia norway nigeria and ecuador according to analysis by nomura 5 who loses those emerging economies nursing current account and fiscal deficits run the risk of large capital outflows and weaker currencies which in turn would spark inflation that in turn will force governments and central banks to weigh up their options hike interest rates even as growth slows or ride it out and risk capital flight nomura s losers list includes turkey ukraine and india 6 what does it mean for the the world s biggest economy while u s oil producers try to take advantage of any sales boost from customers moving away from iran the broader u s economy won t necessarily see benefits with oil price tags as high as 100 a barrel it would be a squeeze on american consumers that are the backbone of still steady economic growth prices at the gas pump already have risen 6 3 percent this month to 2 87 a gallon which could weigh on retail sales that jumped in march by the most since 2017 and if things go awry in global oil markets there s risk that political blame shifts back to the u s for the sanctions which could mean backlash via investment or other channels that threatens economic stability 7 will it lead to higher inflation around the world because energy features prominently in consumer price gauges policy makers look to core indexes that remove volatile components if the run up in prices proves to be substantial and sustained those costs will filter through to transportation and utilities 8 what does it mean for central banks led by the federal reserve central banks around the world have taken a dovish tilt as the absence of inflation allows policy makers to shift their focus to slowing growth that s unlikely to quickly change the international monetary fund this month lowered its global

jerome powell won t be raising interest rates any time soon a couple of months ago everyone was panicking about impending recessions and inverted yield curves now the us has just reported much

bank the federal reserve to cut interest rates have grown even louder why s that no one wants tighter monetary policy especially not politicians later this week the federal reserve will meet up to discuss what it should do next with monetary policy it might be a tricky discussion you see it s pretty clear now that fed boss jerome powell is well on the way to being a true convert to the greenspan gospels commandment number one thou shalt not allow the s p 500 to fall by 20 powell admitted it earlier this year with the fed s epic u turn on interest rates which has helped to power the world s financial assets to a record breaking start to the year meanwhile donald trump has been calling for the fed to do even more indeed he s even called for more money printing quantitative easing qe earlier this month he said i think they should drop rates and get rid of quantitative tightening you would see a rocket ship presumably he s referring to the us economy there this should come as no surprise trump s business background is in property and you wouldn t expect a property guy to be anything other than a fan of low interest rates property is all about debt after all that said it seems harsh to single trump out i can t imagine there are many lobbyists for higher interest rates out there among the asset owning classes and to be fair i haven t seen many other past presidents crying out for higher interest rates during their terms in office either trump just happens to be in the hot seat during what should be a rate rising cycle and he s hardly the only person saying we should print more money that s exactly what the advocates of modern monetary theory mmt getting lots of press for the democrats are calling out for as well make no mistake everyone wants easy money which is one reason that it s so hard to hold out as fed boss anyway the trouble for trump and for powell more pertinently is that the latest us gdp figures were a lot better than expected us economic output grew at a rate of 3 2 in the first quarter versus expectations for 2 growth that is pretty impressive given that a couple of months ago people couldn t stop talking about the shutdown and you d think it might make the fed start to wonder whether the economy is fragile enough to justify scrapping all rate rises for the year ahead there are many excuses for the fed to be dovish the good news for the fed is that there are plenty of excuses it can make if it wants to keep the market s hopes alive the fed s key interest rate is sitting at a level of 2 25 to 2 5 right now and it certainly won t be rising this week i can tell you that firstly even if economic growth is doing ok there are plenty of holes that can be picked in the report there are always holes that can be picked in these reports but the eagerness to do so in the mainstream press shows that the fed will be pushing at an open door if it decides to be even more cautious this week for example a lot of the growth was based on stockpiling companies building up inventories due to fears of trade disruption underlying domestic demand grew by just 1 3 versus 2 6 the previous quarter meanwhile inflation rose at an annualised rate of just 1 3 which is well below the fed s target of 2 secondly and perhaps more importantly there s the issue of the strong us dollar powell knows as well as anyone else does that a strong american currency is bad news for rising markets an emerging market crisis would not go down well with us investors they might be willing to ride it out but not so much if the earnings of us listed stocks which sell lots of goods overseas get hammered too you ve also got members of the fed board saying that they might be as well to take out some insurance cuts just for the sake of it that s a point made by fed vice chair richard clarida notes the ft clarida pointed out that the fed did this in both 1995 and 1998 clarida presumably doesn t think that this overly precautionary monetary policy had anything to do with the rampant tech bubble and bust that ended the 1990s anyway don t be surprised if the fed sounds even more nervous at its next meeting than it did at the last and don t be surprised if an earlier end to quantitative tightening is hinted at i suspect they ll want to head the strong dollar off as quickly as possible if not the eventual market reaction will force the issue further down the line in terms of your own portfolio stick to your plan give a bit of thought to taking some profits from overseas investments and bringing them back to sterling assets if relevant and have a bit of gold for when a dovish fed and inflationary pressure finally start to convince people of the value of the yellow metal oh and subscribe to moneyweek if you don t already

this article is more than 4 years old the bad policy ideas just keep on coming from scotland ruling party saturday the scottish national party which controls scotland s independent parliament voted to ditch the british pound as soon as practicable when or if the country gains full independence the vote appears to be motivated by little more than animosity toward many things english a recurrent theme for the snp it could signal a turn towards venezuelan style economics the problem with such a policy is that it may do far more to harm scotland s economy than the joy it will give snp party members in snubbing the english here s what you need to know scotland already has a near perfect currency regime the scottish banks the royal bank of scotland the bank of scotland and the clydesdale bank issue their own branded bills a k a notes which circulate through the scottish economy and also through the rest of the u k these bills change hands one for one with bank of england bills that one for one exchange rate helps scotland s economy because it provides businesses in scotland with stability scotland s sends 61 of its exports to the rest of the u k which is nearly four times the amount of trade with the eu market according to british government data introducing a new currency that would presumably fluctuate in value versus the pound would add extra costs of scotland s businesses and so hurt the economy those additional expenses could include higher costs to borrow money britain currently benefits from a rare privilege because the pound is one of a few reserve currencies the other major ones include the u s dollar the euro the japanese yen because many countries choose to hold the pound it means the british economy has easier and cheaper access to money that access to cheaper borrowing could quickly disappear if the snp gets its way and ditches the pound the result would mean interest rates would be higher than otherwise oil led currency volatility scotland s vast reserves of oil and natural gas present another problem if scotland does ditch the pound the wild swings in energy prices which are a regular feature of the oil and gas market could also make the new scottish currency volatile swings in the new currency which would come in line with the gyrations in the oil market could hurt any scottish business that relies on exports when oil prices rise then typically the value of the currency in an oil rich country will increase too that higher value makes it harder for businesses to export this doesn t happen in britain s economy because as a whole it is well diversified and the energy sector s contributions are relatively small however that s not the case with scotland it has a relatively small economy where the oil revenues would loom larger in scotland than they do for the uk as a whole the venezuelan connection the move by snp members to call for an independent currency seems reminiscent of the recent economic policies from venezuela s socialist government the south american country is the only state in the world currently experiencing hyperinflation it s annualized inflation rate hit 72 944 on april 27 according to steve hanke an expert in hyperinflation and professor of applied economics at the johns hopkins university that hyperinflation inflation has ruined the country s economy which has collapsed venezuela s government could solve the inflation problem overnight by adopting the u s dollar as its currency but the hatred of all things american and all things capitalist by the country s leaders has led them to persistently reject that idea even though adopting the dollar could bring the economy back to life in a trice that s where there are similarities with scotland s ruling snp the ultra left leaning party repeatedly adopts policies that are all but guaranteed to hurt its economy it also embracing some ideas like ditching the pound which are designed only to snub england scotland s people deserve better than bad policies which have the sole merit of sending a message of disdain to their leading trading partner
what oil at us 100 a barrel would mean for the world economy surging crude prices are posing another headwind for the world economy after president donald trump s zero pledge on iran oil sales brent crude has risen about 40 per cent this year and is at the highest in six months while higher prices due to strong demand typically reflects a robust world economy a shock from constrained supply is a negative much will depend on how sustained the spike proves to be exporting nations will enjoy a boost to corporate and government revenues while consuming nations will bear the cost at the pump potentially fanning inflation and hurting demand ultimately there comes a point where higher prices may be damaging to everyone 1 what does it mean for global growth the impact will vary rising oil prices will hurt household income and spending and it could accelerate inflation as the world s biggest importer of oil china is vulnerable and many countries in europe also rely on imported energy seasonal effects will also impact with the northern hemisphere summer approaching consumers can switch energy sources and scale back usage a slowing world economy will also hurt demand and by extension keep a lid on prices 2 how can the world economy absorb oil at us 100 for a sustained hit to growth economists say oil would need to hold above us 100 it also depends on dollar strength or weakness given crude is priced in greenbacks analysis by oxford economics found that brent at us 100 per barrel by the end of 2019 means the level of global gross domestic product would be 0 6 per cent lower than currently projected by end 2020 with inflation on average 0 7 percentage points higher we see increased risks of significantly higher oil prices oxford economists john payne and gabriel sterne wrote in a note in the short run it is likely the supply impact will be offset by higher production elsewhere but the market is tightening and all it would take is one more shock to supply and oil could reach us 100 3 how will iran and trump impact the market an upending of global oil trade around the iran trump spat could continue to have a sizable impact on financial markets as the affected supply is as much as 800 000 barrels a day uncertainties around availability have already whipsawed oil markets and the political sensitivities of these developments have other markets bracing for volatility trump has pledged to help alongside saudi arabia and the u a e those needing to shift orders from iran to another supplier but u s claims that its domestic supply can help offset the loss are a high bar to meet given that the daily american output for similar crude is about a quarter of iran s 4 who wins from higher oil prices emerging economies dominate the list of oil producing nations which is why they re affected more than developed ones the increase in revenues will help to repair budgets and current account deficits allowing governments to increase spending that will spur investment winners include saudi arabia russia norway nigeria and ecuador according to analysis by nomura 5 who loses those emerging economies nursing current account and fiscal deficits run the risk of large capital outflows and weaker currencies which in turn would spark inflation that in turn will force governments and central banks to weigh up their options hike interest rates even as growth slows or ride it out and risk capital flight nomura s losers list includes turkey ukraine and india 6 what does it mean for the world s biggest economy while u s oil producers try to take advantage of any sales boost from customers moving away from iran the broader u s economy won t necessarily see benefits with oil price tags as high as us 100 a barrel it would be a squeeze on american consumers that are the backbone of still steady economic growth prices at the gas pump already have risen 6 3 per cent this month to us 2 87 a gallon which could weigh on retail sales that jumped in march by the most since 2017 and if things go awry in global oil markets there s risk that political blame shifts back to the u s for the sanctions which could mean backlash via investment or other channels that threatens economic stability 7 will it lead to higher inflation around the world because energy features prominently in consumer price gauges policy makers look to core indexes that remove volatile components if the run up in prices proves to be substantial and sustained those costs will filter through to transportation and utilities 8 what does it mean for central banks led by the federal reserve central banks around the world have taken a dovish tilt as the absence of inflation allows policy makers to shift their focus to slowing growth that s unlikely to quickly change the international monetary fund this month lowered its global growth forecast and said the world is in a delicate moment
in the wake of a slowing global economy middle eastern countries need to press ahead with structural reforms fiscal consolidation diversifying their economies boosting employment and harnessing the disruptive powers of technology a senior international monetary fund official said it s ever so more important to implement structural reforms and there are a certain number of low hanging fruits jihad azour imf director of the middle east and central asia department said in an interview with the national it s important to pursue the consolidation that has started a few years ago and to anchor it into the medium term fiscal framework this is where the target should be the washington based lender is projecting global growth to slow to 3 3 per cent in 2019 from 3 6 per cent last year before rising up again to 3 6 per cent in 2020 uncertainty over brexit and trade tensions between the us and china the world s two largest economies have dented global economic output within the broader middle east north africa afghanistan and pakistan region menap overall gross domestic product gdp is projected to slow to 1 5 per cent this year from 1 8 per cent in 2018 before accelerating by 3 2 per cent next year according to the imf s regional economic outlook released on monday economies of oil exporting menap countries are expected to expand by 0 4 per cent this year with their non oil gdp output rising 2 1 per cent their economies will accelerate by 2 8 per cent and non oil gdp output will rise by 2 9 per cent in 2020 oil importing economies are expected to slow to 3 6 per cent from 4 2 per cent last year and rebound to 4 per cent in 2020 oil exporters have pressed forward with economic diversification agendas in the wake of a three year oil price slump that began in the middle of 2014 the implementation of vat reduction of the public wage bill and removal of subsidies on fuel and electricity sectors were steps in the right direction mr azour said while fiscal stimulus programmes to kick start economic growth are good oil exporters need to move forward gradually with an instrument driven financial inclusion policy that addresses macro and sectoral issues as well as challenges facing companies mr azour said it s an integrated framework that is needed here he said these policy decisions will allow sovereigns to be more predictable in terms of their consolidation plans and will make them less dependent on the evolution of the price of oil the path of diversification will help the economy to be less dependent on the fiscal stimulus said the imf official who previously served as lebanon s finance minister for the gcc it is still important to pursue fiscal adjustment by anchoring their fiscal policy into medium term fiscal plans will allow them to be less impacted by movement in oil price although the last five years have shown that the recovery from the oil price shock is slow higher than average growth of the non oil economy is positive mr azour said in the long term the region needs to better understand how the fourth revolution is going to shape up the global economy and what is the play a region like gcc could benefit from he added access to finance in the menap region for small and medium sized enterprises smes which account for more than 90 per cent of businesses remains a big challenge credit to the private sector or smes which employ 30 to 60 per cent of the population in different countries does not exceed 6 per cent on average which is one of the lowest in the world unemployment in the region also remains particularly high at 24 per cent among young people at the end of last year close to 19 per cent in the female population according to the imf report the region has not been able to address the problem of unemployment in the last ten years we are talking the whole region he said addressing those impediments will have a positive impact increased competition among banks and reforms to strengthen legislative frameworks are key to credit growth being extended to the private sector increasing transparency and corporate governance are also important he said for the oil importing nations such as lebanon and jordan which are laden with public debt maintaining untargeted and costly subsidies is not sustainable oil importers need to reform overall subsidy policies and build stronger safety nets that allow them to channel government support to those who need it most for lebanon and jordan reforming their electricity companies is a priority he said those companies are bleeding and affecting the macro economic stability the solution is to have a comprehensive energy policy gradually move to full removal of the subsidies and then redirect subsidies differently targeted on poverty alleviation he added the level of debt for oil importers is on average about 80 per cent of gdp or more and has risen rapidly over the past decade countries such as lebanon and jordan have limited fiscal space and need to spend less on social protection in comparison to other emerging market countries mr azour said this level of debt is unsustainable and needs to be addressed and the countries need to use wisely their fiscal tools he added the imf director also called on international community to help palestine with its fiscal woes as the economy teeters on the verge of collapse there s a need for the international community to help palestine address its economic and financial challenges by allowing the economy to get access to resources mr azour said

once again the federal reserve has regrettably become a favorite whipping boy president trump has been lobbying it to lower interest rates even though the unemployment rate is 3 8 percent progressives are still complaining that the central bank didn t do enough to stimulate the economy in the wake of the 2008 recession more worrisome mr trump has been attacking the fed s actions with more vitriol than any previous president in memory while proposing two highly partisan and unqualified nominees to join a distinguished board that has historically been free of any political agenda the policy critics on both sides are about as wrong as imaginable and above all we need to guard the independence of the central bank the most important government institution that has not been divided by the deep partisanship so evident elsewhere in an era when even the supreme court divides routinely along ideological lines the fed still maintains an analytical and as the former chairman janet yellen liked to say data dependent approach to policymaking
overview restrictions are there any restrictions on the establishment of a business entity by a foreign licensor or a joint venture involving a foreign licensor and are there any restrictions against a foreign licensor entering into a licence agreement without establishing a subsidiary or branch office whether or not any such restrictions exist is there any filing or regulatory review process required before a foreign licensor can establish a business entity or joint venture in your jurisdiction in most cases to enter into a licence agreement the foreign licensor does not need to establish a business entity in vietnam or a joint venture with a vietnamese party establishing a subsidiary or branch office in vietnam is optional there are no restrictions against a foreign licensor entering into a licence agreement without establishing a subsidiary or branch office in vietnam foreign licensors who wish to establish a business entity in vietnam have to satisfy certain conditions or restrictions imposed on foreign investors typical examples of these conditions and restrictions include among other things limitations on foreign ownership in certain sectors business sector restrictions requirements for forms of investment geographic restrictions conditions on the qualifications of vietnamese partners and other conditions or requirements relating to specific business sectors as for regulatory review requirements to establish a company in vietnam foreign licensors must obtain at least an investment registration certificate irc the irc will set out content relating to the investment project such as investors project location objectives and scale of the project investment capital investment incentives and restrictions and an enterprise registration certificate erc the erc will provide the corporate details such as the company name registered office address charter capital owner s details and legal representatives of the company the provincial department of planning and investment or the board of management of the relevant industrial zone or park with jurisdiction over the location of the investment project has the power to approve the ircs and ercs however larger scale projects and certain types of projects require a decision on investment planning approval from higher level government bodies prior to submission of the irc and erc to the local investment authorities in addition approval of the foreign investment from a number of other government bodies may be required depending on the nature and scale of the foreign investment kinds of licences forms of licence arrangement identify the different forms of licence arrangements that exist in your jurisdiction vietnamese law does not explicitly differentiate between types of licence arrangements some licence arrangements are expressly regulated by specific laws while others are not and therefore will be treated as civil arrangements under civil laws the two general licence arrangements are as follows licence arrangements that are regulated by specific laws these include copyright licence arrangements which include software licences performance or tv show licences music licences industrial property rights licences such as patent licences trademark or service mark licences industrial design licences plant variety licences technology transfer licences and franchise agreements and licence arrangements that are regulated by civil laws this covers other types of licences for example celebrity and character licences or licence agreements for non registered industrial property subject matters law affecting international licensing creation of international licensing relationship does legislation directly govern the creation or otherwise regulate the terms of an international licensing relationship describe any such requirements yes legislation directly governs the terms of a licensing relationship vietnamese law does not differentiate between national and international licensing relationships the law requires that a licence agreement must be established in the form of a written contract and must consist of the following terms full names and addresses of the licensor and the licensee grounds for licensing contract type licensing scope including limitations on use rights and territorial limitations contract term duration licensing price and rights and obligations of the licensor and the licensee the law also provides limitations on industrial property licences in particular the licence contract must not have provisions that unreasonably restrict the rights of the licensee such as terms that prohibit the licensee from improving the industrial property object other than marks or compel the licensee to transfer to the licensor free of charge improvements to the industrial property object made by the licensee and must not directly or indirectly restrict the licensee from exporting goods produced or services provided under the licence contract to territories where the licensor neither holds the respective industrial property right nor has the exclusive right to import such goods pre contractual disclosure what pre contractual disclosure must a licensor make to prospective licensees are there any requirements to register a grant of international licensing rights with authorities in your jurisdiction there are no specific pre contractual disclosure obligations for the licensor to make to prospective licensees under vietnamese law except for franchise agreements which will be discussed below however the general obligations for civil transactions which cover licence agreements require each party to freely and voluntarily enter into the agreement and establish fulfil or terminate rights and obligations in good faith and honestly to exercise good faith and honesty the licensor is required to disclose information that might influence the decision of the prospective licensee to enter into the licence agreement for example the ownership of the licensor with the licensed intellectual property right ipr and the validity thereof under the franchise regulations unless the franchisor and franchisee agree otherwise the franchisor must provide the proposed franchisee with a copy of the franchise agreement form and a franchise disclosure document at least 15 business days before the date that the franchise agreement is to be signed in addition foreign franchisors in any business sector must register their franchising activities with the ministry of industry and trade moit before conducting franchising activities in vietnam the law provides that a licence agreement shall take effect as so agreed by the two parties but it shall be legally valid against third parties only after being recorded with the national office of intellectual property of vietnam noip this may be interpreted to mean that registration of a licence agreement is not compulsory however the registration of the licence agreement provides some advantages for the parties such as to facilitate the transfer of royalties to an offshore licensor or to ensure that use of a mark by the licensee will inure to the trademark owner to defend the mark in a non use cancellation action registration are there any statutorily or court imposed implicit obligations in your jurisdiction that may affect an international licensing relationship such as good faith or fair dealing obligations the obligation to act reasonably in the exercise of rights or requiring good cause for termination or non renewal vietnam s law on intellectual property ip law and relevant regulations do not have a general rule for fair dealing in a licensing relationship however good faith is a fundamental principle in vietnam s civil code which governs civil transactions including licensing relationships and it is expressly indicated in article 3 that each person must establish exercise or fulfil or terminate his her civil rights and or obligations in the principle of goodwill and honesty to terminate a licensing relationship good causes are not required instead the interested parties can agree on any circumstances for termination or non renewal intellectual property issues paris convention is your jurisdiction party to the paris convention for the protection of industrial property the patent cooperation treaty pct the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips yes vietnam has been a member of the paris convention for the protection of industrial property 1883 since 1949 the patent cooperation treaty 1970 since 1993 and the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights 1994 since 2007 contesting validity can the licensee be contractually prohibited from contesting the validity of a foreign licensor s intellectual property rights or registrations in your jurisdiction no article 144 2 of the intellectual property law provides that a licence contract must not have provisions that unreasonably restrict the right of the licensee including prohibiting the licensee from complaining about or initiating lawsuits with regard to the validity of the industrial property rights or the licensor s right to license the law further indicates that such provision in a licence agreement if any shall be invalid invalidity or expiry what is the effect of the invalidity or expiry of registration of an intellectual property right on a related licence agreement in your jurisdiction if the licence remains in effect can royalties continue to be levied if the licence does not remain in effect can the licensee freely compete article 148 3 of the ip law sets out that the licence agreement shall be terminated upon the end of validity of the licensed ipr as such once the validity of an ipr expires or is terminated the related licence agreement will no longer be in effect in such case the royalties may not continue to be levied and the licensee can freely compete unless otherwise explicitly agreed by the two parties in the licence agreement requirements specific to foreigners is an original registration or evidence of use in the jurisdiction of origin or any other requirements unique to foreigners necessary prior to the registration of intellectual property in your jurisdiction the laws do not require an original registration or evidence of use in the jurisdiction of origin or any other requirements unique to foreigners to register intellectual property in vietnam an original or certified copy of registration in the country of origin is only required when the application for registration of intellectual property claims priority rights from a prior registration in the such jurisdiction furthermore foreign applicants need to appoint a local representative to pursue registration of intellectual property in vietnam unregistered rights can unregistered trademarks or other intellectual property rights that are not registered be licensed in your jurisdiction in principle in vietnam trademark rights are only derived from registration except for well known marks therefore the transfer of the right to use unregistered trademarks as well as other ipr to which rights are established upon registration is not considered a licence agreement and cannot be recorded at the noip however the rightsholder can still grant the right to use of unregistered intellectual property to another party in the form of a civil contract for intellectual property objects for which the rights are not derived from registration such as copyright the licence can be made without registration of such objects security interests are there particular requirements in your jurisdiction to take a security interest in intellectual property in principle ipr can be registered for security interest however the laws do not set particular requirements to take a security interest in intellectual property proceedings against third parties can a foreign owner or licensor of intellectual property institute proceedings against a third party for infringement in your jurisdiction without joining the licensee from your jurisdiction as a party to the proceedings can an intellectual property licensee in your jurisdiction institute proceedings against an infringer of the licensed intellectual property without the consent of the owner or licensor can the licensee be contractually prohibited from doing so yes a foreign owner or licensor of intellectual property can institute proceedings against a third party for infringement without joining the licensee as a party to the proceedings in vietnam the law also allows a licensee to request handling of infringement by administrative measures provided that the trademark owner does not explicitly restrict the licensee s right to do so although the laws do not expressly state the same for civil and criminal measures it may be interpreted that the same requirements will apply the licensee can be contractually prohibited from instituting proceedings against an infringer of the licensed intellectual property without the consent of the owner or licensor sub licensing can a trademark or service mark licensee in your jurisdiction sub license use of the mark to a third party if so does the right to sub license exist statutorily or must it be granted contractually if it exists statutorily can the licensee validly waive its right to sub license yes a trademark or service mark licensee can sub license the use of the mark to a third party with the consent of the master licensor the right to sub license does not exist statutorily but must be granted contractually jointly owned intellectual property if intellectual property in your jurisdiction is jointly owned is each co owner free to deal with that intellectual property as it wishes without the consent of the other co owners are co owners of intellectual property rights able to change this position in a contract co owners of intellectual property except copyright must jointly act when they want to deal with that intellectual property including licensing or assigning it to a third party or using it as security the noip requires the mutually signed written consent of all co owners to the licensing of the industrial property objects to record the licence agreement if the licence agreement has not been signed by all of the co owners in other words if one of the co owners is to act on its own the other co owners must give written consent for the former to act on their behalf the co owners are not able to change this position in a contract however in the case of copyright the laws provide that in a case of joint ownership of a work performance audio or visual fixation or broadcast that is composed of separate parts detachable for independent use copyright holders or related rights holders may license their copyright or related rights in their separate parts to other organisations or individuals this means each co owner is free to deal with its separate part as it wishes without the consent of the other co owners first to file is your jurisdiction a first to file or first to invent jurisdiction can a foreign licensor license the use of an invention subject to a patent application but in respect of which the patent has not been issued in your jurisdiction vietnam adopts the first to file principle licences can only be recorded for patented inventions a foreign licensor can licence the use of an invention but it would not be considered a licence of a patent application and cannot be recorded such licence agreement will be treated as a contract governed by civil laws scope of patent protection can the following be protected by patents in your jurisdiction software business processes or methods living organisms software business processes or methods vietnam currently excludes software comprising computer programs libraries and data and business processes or methods from the scope of patentable subject matter under article 59 of the ip law computer programs business methods and presentations of information are listed as types of subject matter that are expressly not eligible for patent protection however there are exceptions as follows regarding computer programs while a computer program itself in the form of code cannot be patented the vietnamese guidelines for patent examination provide for the concept of computer implemented inventions which are inventions involving the use of computers computer networks or other programmable apparatus whereby prima facie one or more of the features of the claimed invention are realised wholly or partly by means of a program or programs this invention could be patentable if it has a technical character and is a technical solution for solving a technical problem by technical means to attain a technical effect provided that the technical effect goes beyond the normal physical interactions between the program and the computer the ip law defines an invention as a technical solution in the form of a product or a process in practice patent examiners usually interpret a product to be a tangible product accordingly for a computer implemented invention to take the form of a product the designation of subject matter of a claim must be converted into a tangible designation such as a storage medium containing a computer program that regarding business processes or methods according to the vietnamese guidelines for patent examination the claimed subject matter will be excluded from patent protection if it is merely directed to a method of doing business does not use technical means does not solve any technical problems and does not create any technical effects however this means if the claimed subject matter involves methods of doing business and specifies an apparatus or a technical process for carrying out at least some part of these methods the subject matter will not be excluded from patent protection as such living organisms article 59 of the ip law includes plant varieties and animal breeds in its list of subject matters that are not protectable as inventions however point 5 8 2 8 of the guidelines for patent examination states that inventions related to plants and animals are protected as long as their technical features are not limited to a specific plant variety or animal breed for example transgenic plants are normally protectable as inventions in addition plant varieties are protectable by the rights to plant varieties if they are novel distinct uniform stable designated by proper denominations and belong to the list of state protected plant species promulgated by the ministry of agriculture and rural development of vietnam the requirements for plant variety protection are stipulated in detail in articles 158 163 of the ip law processes of plant or animal production that are not microbiological processes and are principally of biological nature are not protected either according to article 59 of the ip law however according to point 5 8 2 8 of the guidelines for patent examination it is possible to grant patents for invention or utility solution to processes of plant variety or animal breed production that are not of biological nature whether a process is considered to be biological or not is based on the degree of technical intervention by humans in the said process if the technical intervention by humans in the process is a critical or controlling factor for its products or effectiveness the process does not involve a biological nature for example a process of irradiating cattle for high yield production of milk is protectable on the other hand microorganisms are not mentioned in article 59 of the ip law and therefore are protectable as inventions in particular point 5 8 2 8 of the guidelines for patent examination states that microorganisms and microbiological processes are eligible for patent protection if they are not in opposition to the social ethics and public order and not prejudicial to national defence and security trade secrets and know how is there specific legislation in your jurisdiction that governs trade secrets or know how if so is there a legal definition of trade secrets or know how in either case how are trade secrets and know how treated by the courts yes vietnam s ip law and the law on technology transfer no 07 2017 qh 14 dated 19 june 2017 and effective from 1 july 2018 govern trade secrets and know how under article 4 23 of the ip law a trade secret means information obtained from activities of financial or intellectual investment which has not yet been disclosed and can be used in business under article 2 1 of the law on technology transfer know how means information accumulated and discovered during the process of research production and business by the technology owner which is decisive for the quality and competitive capacity of technology and technological products know how includes technical know how and technological know how so far there have been very few cases regarding trade secrets brought before the court taking into account the lack of precedents and the limited ip expertise of the court it is unpredictable how trade secrets and know how will be treated by the court does the law allow a licensor to restrict disclosure or use of trade secrets and know how by the licensee or third parties in your jurisdiction both during and after the term of the licence agreement is there any distinction to be made with respect to improvements to which the licensee may have contributed yes the law allows a licensor to restrict disclosure or use of trade secrets and know how by the licensee or third parties both during and after the term of the licence agreement as agreed by the two parties in the related licence agreement except when disclosing or using trade secrets acquired without knowing or having the obligation to know that they have been unlawfully acquired by others disclosing secret data in order to protect the public using secret data not for commercial purposes disclosing or using trade secrets obtained independently and disclosing or using trade secrets obtained by analysing or evaluating lawfully distributed products unless otherwise agreed upon by the analysers or evaluators and the owners of such business secrets or sellers of such products the law provides that the licensee owns the ipr for their improvements this can be interpreted to mean that the law does not allow a licensor to restrict or prohibit the use of improvements to which the licensee may have contributed copyright what constitutes copyright in your jurisdiction and how can it be protected in vietnam the following types of work are copyrightable literary and scientific works including textbooks teaching courses and other works expressed in written language or other characters lectures addresses and other speeches press works musical works dramatic works cinematographic works and works created by a process analogous to cinematography plastic artworks and works of applied art photographic works architectural works sketches plans maps and drawings related to topography architecture or scientific works folklore and folk art works of folk culture and computer programs and data compilations to be protected the work must be created personally by the authors through their intellectual labour without copying others works software licensing perpetual software licences does the law in your jurisdiction recognise the validity of perpetual software licences if not or if it is not advisable for other reasons are there other means of addressing concerns relating to perpetual licences article 47 1 of vietnam s ip law defines a copyright licence as the permission given by the copyright holder for other entities to use its rights for a definite term such a provision can be interpreted to mean that the licence of a copyrighted work including a software licence must be for a definite term as such perpetual software licences may not be accepted to address concerns relating to perpetual licences the licence agreement may indicate a licence term concurrent with the term of protection of the licensed software legal requirements are there any legal requirements to be complied with prior to granting software licences including import or export restrictions software products that are incorporated in a medium such as cd vcd dvd hard disk etc may be considered cultural products and if so may be subject to content censorship under the law any products having contents contrary to social ethics and public policy or prejudicial to national defence and security will be banned as such for the purpose of import or export of software products that are considered to be cultural products the importer or exporter needs to obtain an import licence and approval of the content of such products from the competent authorities restrictions on users are there any legal restrictions in your jurisdiction with respect to the restrictions a licensor can put on users of its software in a licence agreement under the law the licensee is entitled to make a single copy of the licensed software for backup and replacement other than that there are no legal restrictions in vietnam with respect to the restrictions a licensor can put on users of its software in a licence agreement such as prohibiting the licensees from carrying out any form of reverse engineering or decompiling of a software program royalties and other payments currency conversion and taxes relevant legislation is there any legislation that governs the nature amount or manner or frequency of payments of royalties or other fees or costs including interest on late payments in an international licensing relationship or require regulatory approval of the royalty rate or other fees or costs including interest on late payments payable by a licensee in your jurisdiction in general parties are free to agree on the amount royalty rate or manner of payment of royalties or other fees or costs of an international licensing agreement there is no regulatory approval requirement of the royalty rate or other fees or costs it is worth noting that according to the civil code 2015 the agreed interest rate must not exceed 20 per cent per annum of the amount overdue restrictions are there any restrictions on transfer and remittance of currency in your jurisdiction are there are any associated regulatory reporting requirements the current regulations on foreign exchange are the ordinance on foreign exchange and its guiding regulations which govern every outbound payment whether to an overseas licensor or otherwise the foreign exchange rule is that within the territory of vietnam except for a few narrow exceptions allowing the use of foreign currency local currency must be used for all transactions of offers payments advertisements quotations pricing prices in contracts agreements and other similar forms including the conversion or adjustment of the prices of goods and services and the values of contracts and agreements in other words the licensee s transactions with its onshore vendors would generally need to be denominated and paid in local currency however the current laws allow a licensee s transaction with its offshore vendors to be denominated and paid in foreign currency it is worth noting that for outbound transfer commercial banks in vietnam are imbued by law with discretion to scrutinise and examine underlying documents before allowing outbound transfers thus the offshore vendors may need to provide the local licensee some documents such as invoices for implementing such outbound transfers taxation of foreign licensor in what circumstances may a foreign licensor be taxed on its income in your jurisdiction a foreign licensor having vietnam sourced income from engaging in a licence agreement with a vietnamese contracting party will be subject to foreign contractor tax fct the fct is subject to any double taxation avoidance agreement that vietnam has entered into with the country under whose laws the foreign licensor is duly established fct consisting of corporate income tax cit and value added tax vat is collected through a withholding mechanism fct rates vary and are specified according to the nature of the service supplied for the cit component the rate varies from 0 1 per cent to 10 per cent for the vat component the rate can range from exempted to 5 per cent competition law issues restrictions on trade are practices that potentially restrict trade prohibited or otherwise regulated in your jurisdiction yes in vietnam antitrust and unfair competition are generally governed by the competition law and its guiding legislation depending on the nature of the activities potentially trade restricting activities can be considered competition restraints or acts of unfair competition that are prohibited under the law for example in accordance with the newly issued law on competition which will come into effect from 1 july 2019 the competition law would prohibit agreements to restrain technical or technological development or agreements not to trade with parties not participating in the agreements if such agreements have or potentially have the effect of significantly restricting competition in the market legal restrictions are there any legal restrictions in respect of the following provisions in licence agreements duration exclusivity internet sales prohibitions non competition restrictions and grant back provisions yes the ip law does not recognise perpetual licence for copyright the ip law also stipulates that a licence agreement shall be terminated upon the termination of validity of the licensed industrial property rights which means the duration of a licence shall not exceed the term of protection of the licensed object in addition the ip law does not allow provisions that unreasonably restrict the right of the licensee particularly provisions that do not derive from the rights of the licensor specifically the following provisions are not allowed prohibiting the licensee from improving the industrial property object other than marks compelling the licensee to transfer to the licensor free of charge improvements to the industrial property object made by the licensee or the right of industrial property registration or industrial property rights to such improvements directly or indirectly restricting the licensee from exporting goods produced or services provided under the licence contract to territories where the licensor neither holds the respective industrial property rights nor has the exclusive right to import such goods compelling the licensee to buy all or a certain percentage of raw materials components or equipment from the licensor or a third party designated by the licensor not for the purpose of ensuring the quality of goods produced or services provided by the licensee and forbidding the licensee to complain about or initiate lawsuits with regard to the validity of the industrial property rights or the licensor s right to license if a licence agreement contains any of the above provisions such provisions shall be invalid in addition the competition law contains a number of provisions that could potentially restrict licence agreements including prohibiting agreements that provide for an exclusive arrangement or non competition restrictions where the parties thereto hold a dominant market position in the relevant market or where such agreements have or potentially have the effect of significantly restricting competition in the market in vietnam unless the transaction is exempted pursuant to the law ip related court rulings have courts in your jurisdiction held that certain uses or abuses of intellectual property rights have been anticompetitive there have been no rulings by the courts that certain uses or abuses of ipr have been anticompetitive however the local laws have some provisions relating to use or abuse of intellectual property rights that could be considered as anticompetitive the law does not specifically mention the situation of pay for delay deals to keep generic drugs or improvements to a product off the market or changing the design of products to extend the term of ip protection however under the law when enterprises hold a dominant market position a dominant market position exists when one enterprise has significant market power as set out by the law or has at least a 30 per cent market share of the relevant market a group of enterprises is deemed to hold a dominant market position when they act together to cause a competition restraining impact and have significant market power as set out by the law or two enterprises have at least a 50 per cent market share three enterprises have at least a 65 per cent market share four enterprises have at least a 75 per cent market share or five enterprises have at least a 85 per cent market share they are not allowed to acquire invention patents utility solution patents or industrial design patents for destruction or for non use purposes these activities could be deemed as prohibited competition restraining agreements if such agreements have or potentially have the effect of significantly restricting competition in the market indemnification disclaimers of liability damages and limitation of damages indemnification provisions are indemnification provisions commonly used in your jurisdiction and if so are they generally enforceable is insurance coverage for the protection of a foreign licensor available in support of an indemnification provision indemnification provisions are commonly used in international licensing contracts of varying subject matter and there are no expressed prohibitions against them similarly insurance coverage is commonly used for the protection of a foreign licensor in support of an indemnification provision however the concept is relatively untested in vietnam similarly there is no legal guidance as to what constitutes a reasonable or otherwise enforceable indemnification provision waivers and limitations can the parties contractually agree to waive or limit certain types of damages are disclaimers and limitations of liability generally enforceable what are the exceptions if any both waivers and limits on liability are frequently used in international licensing agreements and are not prohibited in vietnam thus parties can contractually agree to waive or limit liability to certain types of damages however the enforcement and scopes of both are relatively untested the enforceability of this waiver must be under the judge s discretion currently these matters have not been clarified under vietnamese law or jurisprudence termination right to terminate does the law impose conditions on or otherwise limit the right to terminate or not to renew an international licensing relationship or require the payment of an indemnity or other form of compensation upon termination or non renewal more specifically have courts in your jurisdiction extended to licensing relationships the application of commercial agency laws that contain such rights or remedies or provide such indemnities there are no conditions or other limitations on the right to terminate or not renew a licence relationship vietnamese law does not differentiate between national and international licensing relationships the concerned parties can reach agreements on any circumstances or obligations of the parties for termination or non renewal of a licence agreement impact of termination what is the impact of the termination or expiration of a licence agreement on any sub licence granted by the licensee in the absence of any contractual provision addressing this issue would a contractual provision addressing this issue be enforceable in either case in the absence of any contractual provision stating otherwise the termination or expiration of a licence agreement will result in termination or expiration of any sub licence granted by the licensee if there are contractual provisions on this issue the law respects such agreements between the concerned parties and a contractual provision addressing this issue will be enforceable except when the termination of the licence agreement is caused by the termination of validity of the licensed industrial property rights bankruptcy impact of licensee bankruptcy what is the impact of the bankruptcy of the licensee on the legal relationship with its licensor and any sub licence that the licensee may have granted can the licensor structure its international licence agreement to terminate it prior to the bankruptcy and remove the licensee s rights the bankruptcy of the licensee will not automatically result in the termination of the licensing relationship with the licensor and any sub licensee however during the bankruptcy proceeding on the perception that the performance of the licence contract may have negative impacts on the licensee the creditors or the licensee may request the competent authority to suspend the execution of the contract the licensor can structure its international licence agreement to terminate the licence and remove the licensee s rights by including bankruptcy as a condition for termination of the licence as agreed to by both licensor and licensee under the licence agreement impact of licensor bankruptcy what is the impact of the bankruptcy of the licensor on the legal relationship with its licensee and any sub licence the licensee has granted are there any steps a licensee can take to protect its interest if the licensor becomes bankrupt the bankruptcy of the licensor will not automatically result in the termination of the licensing relationship with the licensee and any sub licensee however during the bankruptcy proceeding on the perception that the performance of the licence contract may have negative impacts on the licensor the creditors or the licensor may request the competent authority to suspend the execution of the contract the licensee can protect its interest if the licensor becomes bankrupt by including bankruptcy as a condition for termination of the licence as agreed to by both licensor and licensee under the licence agreement governing law and dispute resolution restrictions on governing law are there any restrictions on an international licensing arrangement being governed by the laws of another jurisdiction chosen by the parties in most cases an international licensing agreement that involves a foreign element eg one party is an offshore organisation or individual or the assets are located offshore can be governed by foreign law provided that the application of that foreign law is not contrary to the fundamental principles of vietnamese law however the fundamental principles of vietnamese law have been interpreted very broadly and even seemingly minor inconsistencies could render contract terms unenforceable therefore even provisions that seem almost standard to overseas licensors should be examined very carefully to ensure enforceability contractual agreement to arbitration can the parties contractually agree to arbitration of their disputes instead of resorting to the courts of your jurisdiction if so must the arbitration proceedings be conducted in your jurisdiction or can they be held in another generally if the agreement involves a foreign element eg one party is an offshore organisation or individual or the assets are located offshore the parties can mutually agree and set out in their agreement the method for settlement of dispute by arbitration or by court or even by a foreign arbitration or court provided that the dispute does not fall into the exclusive jurisdiction of a vietnamese court if a foreign arbitration organisation is selected the arbitration proceedings can be conducted in another country in principle foreign arbitration awards may be enforceable in vietnam if such awards are declared in a country or by arbitration of a country that is party to an international treaty that vietnam has signed or acceded to as vietnam is a party to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 new york convention foreign arbitration awards could thus be enforceable in vietnam enforceability would a court judgment or arbitral award from another jurisdiction be enforceable in your jurisdiction is your jurisdiction party to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards yes ostensibly a foreign court judgment or foreign arbitration awards can be enforceable in vietnam in accordance with applicable regulations in case of dispute settlement by foreign arbitration vietnam is a member of the new york convention a foreign award from a country that is not a party to the convention may also be enforced in vietnam on a reciprocal basis however foreign arbitral awards need to be recognised in a vietnamese court before they can be enforced unless there is voluntary compliance by the franchisor unlike domestically rendered arbitral awards the recognition proceedings are cumbersome and usually take a year or more to complete in case of dispute settlement by the foreign court it is important to note that the possibility to enforce a foreign court judgment in vietnam is very limited a foreign court judgment may be enforced in vietnam on a treaty or reciprocal basis a treaty on mutual legal assistance with a foreign country is a potential occasion to recognise and enforce the foreign court s judgments however vietnam has entered into very few treaties of this type injunctive relief is injunctive relief available in your jurisdiction may it be waived contractually if so what conditions must be met for a contractual waiver to be enforceable may the parties waive their entitlement to claim specific categories of damages in an arbitration clause yes vietnam has provisional emergency measures roughly akin to temporary injunctive relief in certain other jurisdictions provisional emergency measures are where courts can provisionally deal with the urgent requests of the involved parties to protect evidence and preserve their current conditions in order to avoid irrecoverable damage or to ensure judgment execution there is no legal guidance as to the precise extent or scope of waiver of injunctive relief which is relatively untested in vietnam this means that injunctive relief can be waived contractually but it cannot be enforceable in practice the enforceability of this waiver must be under the judge s discretion currently these matters have not been clarified under vietnamese law or jurisprudence updates trends updates trends updates and trends the new law on competition was issued in june 2018 and will be effective from 1 july 2019 and will significantly alter the competition law regime existing under the 2004 competition law the government and relevant ministries are drafting decrees for the guidance and implementation of the competition law accordingly the guiding decrees will detail regulations on prohibited competition restricting agreements or prohibited acts of enterprises holding a dominant market position that may impact licensing agreements

in the wake of a slowing global economy middle eastern countries need to press ahead with structural reforms fiscal consolidation diversifying their economies boosting employment and harnessing the disruptive powers of technology a senior international monetary fund official said it s ever so more important to implement structural reforms and there are a certain number of low hanging fruits jihad azour imf director of the middle east and central asia department said in an interview with the national it s important to pursue the consolidation that has started a few years ago and to anchor it into the medium term fiscal framework this is where the target should be the washington based lender is projecting global growth to slow to 3 3 per cent in 2019 from 3 6 per cent last year before rising up again to 3 6 per cent in 2020 uncertainty over brexit and trade tensions between the us and china the world s two largest economies have dented global economic output within the broader middle east north africa afghanistan and pakistan region menap overall gross domestic product gdp is projected to slow to 1 5 per cent this year from 1 8 per cent in 2018 before accelerating by 3 2 per cent next year according to the imf s regional economic outlook released on monday economies of oil exporting menap countries are expected to expand by 0 4 per cent this year with their non oil gdp output rising 2 1 per cent their economies will accelerate by 2 8 per cent and non oil gdp output will rise by 2 9 per cent in 2020 oil importing economies are expected to slow to 3 6 per cent from 4 2 per cent last year and rebound to 4 per cent in 2020 oil exporters have pressed forward with economic diversification agendas in the wake of a three year oil price slump that began in the middle of 2014 the implementation of vat reduction of the public wage bill and removal of subsidies on fuel and electricity sectors were steps in the right direction mr azour said while fiscal stimulus programmes to kick start economic growth are good oil exporters need to move forward gradually with an instrument driven financial inclusion policy that addresses macro and sectoral issues as well as challenges facing companies mr azour said it s an integrated framework that is needed here he said these policy decisions will allow sovereigns to be more predictable in terms of their consolidation plans and will make them less dependent on the evolution of the price of oil the path of diversification will help the economy to be less dependent on the fiscal stimulus said the imf official who previously served as lebanon s finance minister for the gcc it is still important to pursue fiscal adjustment by anchoring their fiscal policy into medium term fiscal plans will allow them to be less impacted by movement in oil price although the last five years have shown that the recovery from the oil price shock is slow higher than average growth of the non oil economy is positive mr azour said in the long term the region needs to better understand how the fourth revolution is going to shape up the global economy and what is the play a region like gcc could benefit from he added access to finance in the menap region for small and medium sized enterprises smes which account for more than 90 per cent of businesses remains a big challenge credit to the private sector or smes which employ 30 to 60 per cent of the population in different countries does not exceed 6 per cent on average which is one of the lowest in the world unemployment in the region also remains particularly high at 24 per cent among young people at the end of last year close to 19 per cent in the female population according to the imf report the region has not been able to address the problem of unemployment in the last ten years we are talking the whole region he said addressing those impediments will have a positive impact increased competition among banks and reforms to strengthen legislative frameworks are key to credit growth being extended to the private sector increasing transparency and corporate governance are also important he said for the oil importing nations such as lebanon and jordan which are laden with public debt maintaining untargeted and costly subsidies is not sustainable oil importers need to reform overall subsidy policies and build stronger safety nets that allow them to channel government support to those who need it most for lebanon and jordan reforming their electricity companies is a priority he said those companies are bleeding and affecting the macro economic stability the solution is to have a comprehensive energy policy gradually move to full removal of the subsidies and then redirect subsidies differently targeted on poverty alleviation he added the level of debt for oil importers is on average about 80 per cent of gdp or more and has risen rapidly over the past decade countries such as lebanon and jordan have limited fiscal space and need to spend less on social protection in comparison to other emerging market countries mr azour said this level of debt is unsustainable and needs to be addressed and the countries need to use wisely their fiscal tools he added the imf director also called on international community to help palestine with its fiscal woes as the economy teeters on the verge of collapse there s a need for the international community to help palestine address its economic and financial challenges by allowing the economy to get access to resources mr azour said

friday s figures are preliminary and will be revised at least twice in the months ahead economists warned that the report was inflated by short term factors and probably overstated the underlying pace of growth most anticipate a downshift as the year progresses still after a rough winter the economy appears to have entered the spring fundamentally intact trump heralded the report friday declaring the first quarter growth figure an incredible number we re no 1 economy right now in the world and it s not even close he told reporters on his way to an event in indianapolis trump has often treated gdp along with the stock market the trade deficit and other economic indicators as a sort of scorecard for his presidency late last year that scorecard wasn t looking good as growth slowed the trade deficit ballooned and the stock market plunged advertisement kevin hassett chairman of the president s council of economic advisers acknowledged friday that there had been nervousness inside the white house that the partial federal government shutdown which idled hundreds of thousands of federal workers and disrupted countless private businesses could cause growth to stall in the first quarter a sharp drop in consumer spending in december and a slowdown in job growth in february added to those fears things have looked up since then however consumer confidence rebounded quickly once the shutdown ended and retail sales were strong in march hiring too has recovered and the stock market has roared back hitting record highs this week everything kind of turned around relatively quickly hassett said the government reopened a lot of uncertainty resolved equity markets started to get more confident and then i think a lot of other people did too several factors explain the renewed optimism efforts by chinese authorities to stabilize their slumping economy seem to be working damping fears of a global economic slowdown china and the united states also appear to be nearing a trade deal reducing the risk of a new round of tariffs perhaps the most important factor in the turnaround the federal reserve markets began to stabilize and stocks climbed again after jerome h powell the fed chairman said in january that the central bank would be patient before raising interest rates again after four increases in 2018 trump and his allies had been sharply critical of the fed s rate increases advertisement the president has said he will nominate one such ally stephen moore to fill an opening at the fed on friday moore an informal economic adviser to trump said the new growth figure made him feel 100 per cent vindicated in his criticisms thank god the fed listened to me moore said powell has said the president s criticisms won t influence the bank s decisions still trump has gotten what he wanted when fed policymakers meet next week it is essentially a foregone conclusion that they will leave interest rates unchanged fed officials indicated in march that they did not expect to raise rates again this year in part because they forecast a growth slowdown from last year and still tame inflation friday s report showed inflation slowing yet further in the first quarter indeed despite the robust gdp figure the underlying pace of economic growth has slowed since the middle of last year when tax cuts and government spending briefly pushed the growth rate above 4 per cent the most important components of the economy consumer spending and business investment were both weak in the first quarter and the housing market contracted for the fifth quarter in a row the strength in gdp was partly the result of a surge in inventories and a drop in imports both of which are likely to reverse in the second quarter advertisement for a better gauge of the economy s health analysts recommend focusing on a different number which strips out trade and inventory effects as well as the effect of government spending that measure known as final private sales came in at 1 3 per cent down from 2 6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the weakest showing since 2013 domestic demand in the economy investment consumer spending that was weak said ellen zentner chief us economist for morgan stanley economists expect consumer spending to bounce back in the second quarter as december s market drop and january s shutdown fade into memory but businesses remain cautious in part because they expect the economy to cool gradually as the effects of last year s tax cuts and spending increases fade if there s weakness it s in the business spending data said michael gapen chief us economist for barclays it has yet to rebound in a meaningful way following the end of the government shutdown worthington industries an ohio based metals manufacturer has seen no sign of a slowdown from its domestic customers said andy rose the company s president still spending isn t rising as quickly as it did early in the recovery and slower growth in china and other countries has hurt sales overseas while trump s steel tariffs have driven up costs we re not seeing a drop off but i think the challenge for a lot of us companies right now is to find where the next leg up is going to come from rose said how are we going to drive earnings growth going forward if we re not going to see a big increase in demand that means companies are looking for other ways to improve profitability including cutting costs cost cutting certainly is a late cycle exercise rose said labor costs are going up you have no choice but to try to save costs where you can
islamabad a number of officials in the finance ministry and some top members of the ruling pakistan tehreek i insaf pti believe that reasons behind the removal of asad umar as finance minister were political rather than economic policies justifying this view they said only a few days back the prime minister had praised mr umar for his efforts in lowering the scale of adjustments demanded by the international monetary fund imf in the proposed bailout package the sources said that mr umar who was once considered a close confidant of the prime minister had received the news of his removal with a high surprise as he was not expecting such a move days after his successful visit to washington in connection with the negotiations with the imf interest groups played a key role in changing pm s perception says a cabinet member aide to premier denies political motive for the removal we have almost agreed to the basic framework agreement with top imf officials a source privy to these developments said mr umar was celebrating with fellow cabinet members his success over getting the much harsher conditions of the imf package changed but was not aware that the prime minister had another plan for him the source added the change in the ministerial slot was a big surprise even for the top imf officials in washington the source said a source said the decision also came as a surprise for many of mr umar s associates as they were aware of mr khan s reported statement that he considered the former finance minister as his deputy prime minister conversations with senior officials of the finance ministry and a few cabinet members who have direct knowledge of mr umar s ouster provided various reasons behind the sudden decision of the pm they believed that mr khan was under immense pressure due to a campaign launched by opposition parties against the government over the issues of price hikes and increase in the prices of gas and electricity in addition to an unprecedented devaluation of the pakistani rupee against the us dollar the prime minister thought that the change in portfolio of asad umar will lessen the criticism from opposition and the media said one of the cabinet members on condition of anonymity he said the premier did not expect that his close confidant would refuse to accept another ministry the minister was of the opinion that the pm was perturbed over media reports and discussions by economists in tv talk shows challenging the government s claims about improvements in the economy another federal minister said the prime minister was least interested in matters related to the economy before coming to power as his main focus was on the improvement of education health and climate change however the minister said mr khan after coming to power had to deal with economic issues and in order to keep himself updated had started consultations with other economists some of whom had also been associated with past governments the prime minister had started to believe these economists when they pointed out flaws in the policies which were being pursued by the pti government he added the campaign by some of the interest groups against mr umar also played a major role in changing mr khan s perception about the abilities of his finance minister the interest groups of three sectors were persistent in seeking his removal from the portfolio of finance those involved in the sugar business were also continually criticising mr umar for opposing a subsidy on sugar similarly a group of powerful bankers was also unhappy with some of his decisions regarding regulation of banking services the third group which was all out against mr umar comprised real estate tycoons who were against the introduction of market based valuation rates for taxation in the provinces of punjab khyber pakhtunkhwa and balochistan an understanding was reached on this issue with the revenue ministers of the three provinces the cabinet minister said adding the decision was to be announced in the budget since representatives of all these interest groups always remain present in power corridors they also played a key role in making the prime minister realise that asad umar was not the right choice for this key cabinet position said a senior party leader who is close to the ex minister read performance aside asad umar s resignation ill timed say trade and industry leaders govt denies political motive when contacted special assistant to the prime minister on media affairs yousaf baig mirza said he was present in almost all the top meetings and therefore could say that political situation had nothing to do with mr umar s removal he also denied involvement of any pressure group in the decision saying that he was not aware of the presence of any pressure group mr mirza said the reason for bringing changes in his cabinet had already been cited by the pm the very next day when addressing a public gathering he had declared that those who would not be beneficial for the country would have no place in the cabinet mr mirza said that since the prime minister had himself given the reason for changes he had made in the cabinet therefore he did not want to add anything further addressing a public gathering in kalaya the headquarters of orakzai tribal district a day after shuffling his cabinet the prime minister had stated that the only objective in his mind was the nation s uplift adding i want to tell all the ministers that any one of no use to the country will be replaced with one who is beneficial published in dawn april 29th

first quarter of 2018 return on average assets and return on average tangible equity1 for the first quarter of 2019 were 0 61 percent and 6 64 percent respectively our results for the first quarter of 2019 continue to reflect positive operating leverage as we delivered record operating income in the quarter said javier rodríguez soler president and ceo of bbva compass revenue growth was driven by a double digit increase in net interest income and expense growth was well contained loan growth was modest but most importantly was fully funded by deposit growth as we continued to successfully grow and deepen our deposit relationships while provision levels in the quarter were elevated the overall health of our loan portfolio remains strong as we continue to navigate the challenging environment our focus remains on being at the forefront of the digital transformation in our industry and using technology to improve efficiency and provide our customers with amazing experiences total revenue for the quarter was 932 million an increase of 6 percent from the first quarter of 2018 net interest income totaled 683 million an increase of 60 million or 10 percent from the first quarter of 2018 and an annualized increase of 1 percent on a linked quarter basis the percent net interest margin in the first quarter of 2019 was 3 41 percent an increase of 14 basis points from a year ago and 4 basis points on a linked quarter basis the increase in net interest income reflects higher short term market rates and growth in higher yielding loans partially offset by higher funding costs as customers continue to migrate into interest bearing accounts and the competitive landscape for deposits noted rodríguez soler noninterest income for the quarter totaled 258 million relatively unchanged from first quarter of 2018 levels fee based businesses reported positive growth including card and merchant processing fees 16 percent service charges on deposit accounts 5 percent and money transfer income 6 percent conversely interest rate sensitive businesses and weaker demand impacted corporate and correspondent investment sales 43 percent investment banking and advisory fees 21

percent increase compared to first quarter 2018 levels and down 13 percent on a linked quarter annualized basis as a result of this positive operating leverage operating income1 for the quarter totaled a record 359 million an increase of 41 million or 13 percent from the first quarter of 2018 and the efficiency ratio improved 147 basis points to 61 58 percent compared to 63 05 percent in the first quarter of 2018 in terms of balance sheet growth total loans for the first quarter of 2019 were 65 0 billion an increase of 4 percent from the 62 3 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018 on a reported basis total commercial loans were flat versus a year ago however during the first quarter approximately 1 2 billion of commercial loans were transferred to loans held for sale adjusting for the impact of this transfer the year over year increase in commercial loans was 3 percent total consumer loans grew 6 percent led by increased activity in direct consumer lending 36 percent credit cards 27 percent and indirect auto lending 14 percent although year over year growth in these portfolios was at double digit rates compared to previous quarters the pace of growth slowed particularly compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 total deposits at the end of the first quarter of 2019 were 74 4 billion a 6 percent increase from the 69 9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018 noninterest bearing demand deposits declined 6 percent as customers continue to shift from demand deposits into interest bearing accounts as a result interest bearing transactions accounts savings money market and interest bearing checking increased 11 percent compared to a year ago deposit growth at 4 4 billion fully funded loan growth of 2 7 billion consequently the loan to deposit ratio ended the quarter at 87 percent compared to 89 percent a year ago while loan growth is important maintaining sound underwriting standards and a strong risk profile is one of our highest priorities noted rodríguez soler during the quarter we recorded a meaningful increase in provision expense to address isolated one off issues in our commercial and consumer loan portfolios nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans ended the quarter at 1 34 percent compared to 1 24 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1 11 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2018 the increase in nonperforming loans during the quarter was primarily due to a handful of unrelated commercial credits net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were 63 basis points in the quarter down from 68 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 and up from the 44 basis points recorded during the first quarter of 2018 the increase in net charge offs over the past two quarters was primarily the result of increased charge offs in certain consumer portfolios reflecting growth in those portfolios as well as the further seasoning of newly established consumer direct portfolio product offerings provision expense for the quarter was 182 million exceeding net charge offs by 81 million as a result the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans at the end of the quarter was 1 52 percent up from 1 36 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1 34 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2018 the coverage ratio of nonperforming loans ended the

the debate over the north american free trade agreement nafta spans more than 25 years the trade deal was originally negotiated by the first bush administration then came up for a vote early in president clinton s first term with opposition from a broad coalition of democrats unions some environmental groups family farmers and others at the time activists in the u s mexico and canada opposed the agreement s weak labor protections nonetheless nafta narrowly passed in congress after a vigorous and contentious debate mosads with hindsight we know that critics objections were justified the agreement accelerated corporate outsourcing to mexico eventually costing at least 682 900 u s jobs through 2010 and america s bilateral trade deficit with mexico grew by at least 97 billion on the campaign trail in 2016 candidate donald trump railed against nafta s inequities and vowed to do better calling nafta the worst trade deal ever negotiated since taking office his administration has worked to renegotiate the agreement last fall the president s team unveiled an updated u s mexico canada agreement usmca unfortunately the resulting document offers little for u s workers hoping to find greater job security in the face of subsidized global competition last week the u s international trade commission itc released its assessment of the usmca s economic impact overall they foresee a minor positive impact a gdp increase of 0 35 percent over six years along with 176 000 additional jobs in the domestic economy including 28 000 in the u s automotive and parts sectors one aspect of the itc s estimate focuses on labor rules that could increase mexico union wages by 17 2 percent assuming that these provisions are enforced that s a major if but it holds the promise of real honest enforcement of labor provisions for mexico s factory workers only 14 5 percent of mexico s labor force is unionized and many belong to weak company unions the afl cio other labor unions and members of congress are now demanding that enforcement tools be included in the deal to ensure actual progress note that such increases in mexican wages might only happen after struggles that take longer than the six year timeframe of the itc assessment some of the most noteworthy changes in the usmca involve stronger rules of origin for motor vehicle content plus requirements that 40 45 percent of the labor involved earns at least 16 per hour companies not meeting these requirements would face a tariff on exports to the u s but as the center for automotive research notes the tariff amounts to a mere 2 5 percent companies could simply ignore these wage and content requirements and instead pay the minor tariff the itc admits that the usmca would slightly increase u s car prices resulting in some losses in car sales and employment but they believe these losses would be more than offset by increased domestic parts production however companies could instead offshore more production to other low wage locations in fact researchers at the international monetary fund imf recently concluded the usmca would result in a loss of 794 million for the united states with motor vehicle and parts output declining in all three countries by an average of 7 6 billion overall the usmca s benefits appear highly questionable with many net gains expected to come from increased certainty for investors thanks to new regulations for internet commerce and data transfer that are expected to increase investment but at what cost more offshoring and job loss the itc claims that greater certainty would add 0 47 percentage points to future u s gdp it s a reed thin margin on which to assume the deal s benefits particularly when the usmca also contains a six year sunset clause mossecondads trade agreements have become much more complex in the face of regulatory shifts and changing corporate strategy and the itc s track record on economic modeling doesn t inspire confidence either namely the errant projections for the u s korea trade deal and beijing s 2001 entry into the world trade organization the usmca simply follows the failed model of prior free trade agreements adopted over the past 25 years which facilitate corporate offshoring to low wage countries while undermining democratic power the usmca may nibble at the edges of such long standing precedent but it doesn t appear to make real progress the locations may change factories moving onward from mexico to china malaysia or vietnam for example but the results remain the same it s time for a genuinely new trade model and president trump s team should go back to the drawing board in order to incorporate realistic provisions that can actually save u s jobs not relocate them robert e scott is a senior economist and the director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the economic policy institute

first quarter of 2018 return on average assets and return on average tangible equity1 for the first quarter of 2019 were 0 61 percent and 6 64 percent respectively our results for the first quarter of 2019 continue to reflect positive operating leverage as we delivered record operating income in the quarter said javier rodríguez soler president and ceo of bbva compass revenue growth was driven by a double digit increase in net interest income and expense growth was well contained loan growth was modest but most importantly was fully funded by deposit growth as we continued to successfully grow and deepen our deposit relationships while provision levels in the quarter were elevated the overall health of our loan portfolio remains strong as we continue to navigate the challenging environment our focus remains on being at the forefront of the digital transformation in our industry and using technology to improve efficiency and provide our customers with amazing experiences total revenue for the quarter was 932 million an increase of 6 percent from the first quarter of 2018 net interest income totaled 683 million an increase of 60 million or 10 percent from the first quarter of 2018 and an annualized increase of 1 percent on a linked quarter basis the percent net interest margin in the first quarter of 2019 was 3 41 percent an increase of 14 basis points from a year ago and 4 basis points on a linked quarter basis the increase in net interest income reflects higher short term market rates and growth in higher yielding loans partially offset by higher funding costs as customers continue to migrate into interest bearing accounts and the competitive landscape for deposits noted rodríguez soler noninterest income for the quarter totaled 258 million relatively unchanged from first quarter of 2018 levels fee based businesses reported positive growth including card and merchant processing fees 16 percent service charges on deposit accounts 5 percent and money transfer income 6 percent conversely interest rate sensitive businesses and weaker demand impacted corporate and correspondent investment sales 43 percent investment banking and advisory fees 21

percent increase compared to first quarter 2018 levels and down 13 percent on a linked quarter annualized basis as a result of this positive operating leverage operating income1 for the quarter totaled a record 359 million an increase of 41 million or 13 percent from the first quarter of 2018 and the efficiency ratio improved 147 basis points to 61 58 percent compared to 63 05 percent in the first quarter of 2018 in terms of balance sheet growth total loans for the first quarter of 2019 were 65 0 billion an increase of 4 percent from the 62 3 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018 on a reported basis total commercial loans were flat versus a year ago however during the first quarter approximately 1 2 billion of commercial loans were transferred to loans held for sale adjusting for the impact of this transfer the year over year increase in commercial loans was 3 percent total consumer loans grew 6 percent led by increased activity in direct consumer lending 36 percent credit cards 27 percent and indirect auto lending 14 percent although year over year growth in these portfolios was at double digit rates compared to previous quarters the pace of growth slowed particularly compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 total deposits at the end of the first quarter of 2019 were 74 4 billion a 6 percent increase from the 69 9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018 noninterest bearing demand deposits declined 6 percent as customers continue to shift from demand deposits into interest bearing accounts as a result interest bearing transactions accounts savings money market and interest bearing checking increased 11 percent compared to a year ago deposit growth at 4 4 billion fully funded loan growth of 2 7 billion consequently the loan to deposit ratio ended the quarter at 87 percent compared to 89 percent a year ago while loan growth is important maintaining sound underwriting standards and a strong risk profile is one of our highest priorities noted rodríguez soler during the quarter we recorded a meaningful increase in provision expense to address isolated one off issues in our commercial and consumer loan portfolios nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans ended the quarter at 1 34 percent compared to 1 24 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1 11 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2018 the increase in nonperforming loans during the quarter was primarily due to a handful of unrelated commercial credits net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were 63 basis points in the quarter down from 68 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 and up from the 44 basis points recorded during the first quarter of 2018 the increase in net charge offs over the past two quarters was primarily the result of increased charge offs in certain consumer portfolios reflecting growth in those portfolios as well as the further seasoning of newly established consumer direct portfolio product offerings provision expense for the quarter was 182 million exceeding net charge offs by 81 million as a result the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans at the end of the quarter was 1 52 percent up from 1 36 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1 34 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2018 the coverage ratio of nonperforming loans ended the

islamabad a number of officials in the finance ministry and some top members of the ruling pakistan tehreek i insaf pti believe that reasons behind the removal of asad umar as finance minister were political rather than economic policies justifying this view they said only a few days back the prime minister had praised mr umar for his efforts in lowering the scale of adjustments demanded by the international monetary fund imf in the proposed bailout package the sources said that mr umar who was once considered a close confidant of the prime minister had received the news of his removal with a high surprise as he was not expecting such a move days after his successful visit to washington in connection with the negotiations with the imf interest groups played a key role in changing pm s perception says a cabinet member aide to premier denies political motive for the removal we have almost agreed to the basic framework agreement with top imf officials a source privy to these developments said mr umar was celebrating with fellow cabinet members his success over getting the much harsher conditions of the imf package changed but was not aware that the prime minister had another plan for him the source added the change in the ministerial slot was a big surprise even for the top imf officials in washington the source said a source said the decision also came as a surprise for many of mr umar s associates as they were aware of mr khan s reported statement that he considered the former finance minister as his deputy prime minister conversations with senior officials of the finance ministry and a few cabinet members who have direct knowledge of mr umar s ouster provided various reasons behind the sudden decision of the pm they believed that mr khan was under immense pressure due to a campaign launched by opposition parties against the government over the issues of price hikes and increase in the prices of gas and electricity in addition to an unprecedented devaluation of the pakistani rupee against the us dollar the prime minister thought that the change in portfolio of asad umar will lessen the criticism from opposition and the media said one of the cabinet members on condition of anonymity he said the premier did not expect that his close confidant would refuse to accept another ministry the minister was of the opinion that the pm was perturbed over media reports and discussions by economists in tv talk shows challenging the government s claims about improvements in the economy another federal minister said the prime minister was least interested in matters related to the economy before coming to power as his main focus was on the improvement of education health and climate change however the minister said mr khan after coming to power had to deal with economic issues and in order to keep himself updated had started consultations with other economists some of whom had also been associated with past governments the prime minister had started to believe these economists when they pointed out flaws in the policies which were being pursued by the pti government he added the campaign by some of the interest groups against mr umar also played a major role in changing mr khan s perception about the abilities of his finance minister the interest groups of three sectors were persistent in seeking his removal from the portfolio of finance those involved in the sugar business were also continually criticising mr umar for opposing a subsidy on sugar similarly a group of powerful bankers was also unhappy with some of his decisions regarding regulation of banking services the third group which was all out against mr umar comprised real estate tycoons who were against the introduction of market based valuation rates for taxation in the provinces of punjab khyber pakhtunkhwa and balochistan an understanding was reached on this issue with the revenue ministers of the three provinces the cabinet minister said adding the decision was to be announced in the budget since representatives of all these interest groups always remain present in power corridors they also played a key role in making the prime minister realise that asad umar was not the right choice for this key cabinet position said a senior party leader who is close to the ex minister read performance aside asad umar s resignation ill timed say trade and industry leaders govt denies political motive when contacted special assistant to the prime minister on media affairs yousaf baig mirza said he was present in almost all the top meetings and therefore could say that political situation had nothing to do with mr umar s removal he also denied involvement of any pressure group in the decision saying that he was not aware of the presence of any pressure group mr mirza said the reason for bringing changes in his cabinet had already been cited by the pm the very next day when addressing a public gathering he had declared that those who would not be beneficial for the country would have no place in the cabinet mr mirza said that since the prime minister had himself given the reason for changes he had made in the cabinet therefore he did not want to add anything further addressing a public gathering in kalaya the headquarters of orakzai tribal district a day after shuffling his cabinet the prime minister had stated that the only objective in his mind was the nation s uplift adding i want to tell all the ministers that any one of no use to the country will be replaced with one who is beneficial published in dawn april 29th

overview restrictions are there any restrictions on the establishment of a business entity by a foreign licensor or a joint venture involving a foreign licensor and are there any restrictions against a foreign licensor entering into a licence agreement without establishing a subsidiary or branch office whether or not any such restrictions exist is there any filing or regulatory review process required before a foreign licensor can establish a business entity or joint venture in your jurisdiction in principle there are no such restrictions however business entities that are incorporated under foreign law but are active on the dutch market rather than within their own country are subject to the companies formally registered abroad act the cfra act the cfra act does not apply to members of the european union and countries that are members of the european economic area agreement all other entities must comply with certain requirements applicable to dutch entities registration with the commercial register and filing of annual accounts with the commercial register where the business entity is registered kinds of licences forms of licence arrangement identify the different forms of licence arrangements that exist in your jurisdiction dutch law does not define types of licences as such basically any exclusive right or asset can be the subject of a licence governed by the general provisions on dutch contract law and if applicable the specific provisions in specialised acts such as the dutch patent act licences can include intellectual property rights such as trademarks patents design rights technology transfer copyrights or software and confidential know how the licence can be granted on a pending application or a registered right and can be limited in time or perpetual sole exclusive or not exclusive limited in scope for certain use only for free or for consideration compulsory for certain patent licences or by law copy for private use of copyrighted work law affecting international licensing creation of international licensing relationship does legislation directly govern the creation or otherwise regulate the terms of an international licensing relationship describe any such requirements there is no specific legislation that governs the creation or regulates the terms of an international licensing relationship or that governs royalty rates or fees that may be charged the dutch civil code dcc does not contain specific provisions on licensing the general provisions on dutch contract law apply as well as dutch court decisions book 6 of the dcc sets out the requirements relating to the formation of contracts these provisions must be read in conjunction with the more general rules regarding legal actions that is actions intended to invoke legal consequences as provided in book 3 dcc further commercial contracts including licence agreements are governed by the principle of reasonableness and fairness based on article 6 248 1 dcc this principle may not only supplement the existing contract and relationship but may also derogate from the contract the parties agreed upon at an earlier stage in the event a provision is under the circumstances at hand unacceptable according to the principle of reasonableness and fairness the standard to derogate from an agreed provision is high this said especially very large companies should be aware that a provision in an existing contract could be set aside by the principle of reasonableness and fairness if it is very one sided and thus unacceptable in the given circumstances eg a provision that the licence relationship may be terminated by one of the parties at any given moment upon only 30 days notice especially when dealing with a very small or dependent counterparty it is not possible to predict what kind of provisions may be set aside if any since the court will consider all relevant circumstances including the economic power of each party the interdependency of the parties the duration of the contract the investments made by either party what each party could reasonably expect from the other party and all other relevant circumstances as a general rule dutch courts generally tend to protect economically weaker smaller parties at the expense of stronger larger parties however this certainly does not mean that simply by being a weaker party certain clauses will be set aside in general an agreed contract in writing will define a relationship primarily whether there are grounds to deviate from a written contract depends on all circumstances of the matter including the expectations of the parties when executing the contract there may be a dutch franchise law somewhere in the future years at least the intention of a franchise law has been communicated by the current dutch minister of economic affairs however at the moment it is uncertain how and when the legislative process will take place and what the result of this process is going to be besides the civil law aspects in licensing as well as distribution and all other vertical agreements competition laws play an important role and should be kept in mind the commission regulation eu no 330 2010 of 20 april 2010 on the applicability of article 101 3 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices the commission regulation on vertical agreements is important as well as the eu guidelines thereto the competition law aspects in relation to licensing are further discussed under questions 28 and 29 pre contractual disclosure what pre contractual disclosure must a licensor make to prospective licensees are there any requirements to register a grant of international licensing rights with authorities in your jurisdiction pre contractual disclosure requirements stem from unwritten law and case law which impose upon contracting parties the duty to inform and investigate parties are entitled to rely on the accuracy of each other s information and must always bear in mind each other s reasonable expectations the principle of reasonableness and fairness can also play a role see question 3 there are no requirements to register the grant of international licensing rights with authorities in the netherlands however only after registration does a licence obtain third party effect registration are there any statutorily or court imposed implicit obligations in your jurisdiction that may affect an international licensing relationship such as good faith or fair dealing obligations the obligation to act reasonably in the exercise of rights or requiring good cause for termination or non renewal yes as explained under question 3 the principle of reasonableness and fairness plays an important role in dutch law and this principle also applies to licensing agreements and relationships further under dutch law it is accepted that under certain exceptional circumstances a party may only terminate a long lasting commercial agreement for cause however the general rule is that those agreements can be terminated for convenience but it may be necessary to observe a notice period and possibly even financially compensate the other party see question 31 intellectual property issues paris convention is your jurisdiction party to the paris convention for the protection of industrial property the patent cooperation treaty pct the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips the netherlands is a party to all three treaties contesting validity can the licensee be contractually prohibited from contesting the validity of a foreign licensor s intellectual property rights or registrations in your jurisdiction such contractual arrangement can be made however the principles of reasonableness and fairness which apply to all contractual relationships see question 5 may cause such arrangement to be invalid or be set aside depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular matter also under certain circumstances such an arrangement may be contrary to the applicable competition laws see questions 26 and 27 invalidity or expiry what is the effect of the invalidity or expiry of registration of an intellectual property right on a related licence agreement in your jurisdiction if the licence remains in effect can royalties continue to be levied if the licence does not remain in effect can the licensee freely compete the effect is governed by the terms of the licence agreement if the agreement does not provide for such a situation and the licensed right expires the licence at least insofar as the expired right is concerned also ends if the licensed right is declared invalid it has owing to the retroactive effect thereof never existed however this does not affect the agreement concluded prior to the invalidity insofar as it has been performed prior to the invalidity date nevertheless depending on the circumstances repayment of royalties already paid may be claimed article 55 of regulation eu no 2017 1001 european trademark regulation and article 26 of regulation ec no 6 2002 european design regulation after the licence has ended the licensee can in principle freely compete with the former licensor although the agreement may contain non compete provisions that survive the termination of the licence whether those provisions are enforceable against licensee depends on compliance with competition law competing with licensor may under the terminated agreement also be prohibited owing to possible contractual restrictions on the use of licensed secret know how requirements specific to foreigners is an original registration or evidence of use in the jurisdiction of origin or any other requirements unique to foreigners necessary prior to the registration of intellectual property in your jurisdiction unless a priority right is invoked under article 4c of the paris convention no unregistered rights can unregistered trademarks or other intellectual property rights that are not registered be licensed in your jurisdiction under benelux trademark law unregistered trademarks do not receive trademark protection unless they fall within the scope of article 6 bis of the paris convention for the protection of industrial property 1883 however parties can conclude licences for the use of unregistered signs such as trade names and domain names further unregistered rights such as copyrights or unregistered community design rights can also be licensed as well as confidential know how security interests are there particular requirements in your jurisdiction to take a security interest in intellectual property a security interest in an intellectual property right must be vested by a written deed to that effect which must contain a description of the pledged subject there are no particular requirements for security interests in intellectual property rights however in order for the security interest ie a right of pledge to have third party effect the security interest should be registered in the official intellectual property ip registers in case of a registered ip right such as a trademark design right or patent if a right of pledge is vested in an intellectual property right for which no register exists such as copyrights there is no such obligation usually a deed of pledge will be registered with the tax authorities anyway proceedings against third parties can a foreign owner or licensor of intellectual property institute proceedings against a third party for infringement in your jurisdiction without joining the licensee from your jurisdiction as a party to the proceedings can an intellectual property licensee in your jurisdiction institute proceedings against an infringer of the licensed intellectual property without the consent of the owner or licensor can the licensee be contractually prohibited from doing so yes the foreign owner or licensor is in principle free to act on its own against infringements but the licensee can join the proceedings to claim its own damages the licensee cannot initiate proceedings for infringement without the licensor s consent and the licensee can only initiate proceedings of its own to claim damages with the express permission of the owner however the court of justice of the european union cjeu has ruled hassan v breiding and thomas phillips v grüne welle that with regard to eu trademarks and designs the holder of an exclusive licence may initiate proceedings without the licensor s consent if the licensor does not act after having been urged to do so it furthermore ruled that the licensee can take action with consent of the licensor even if the licence has not been registered often licence agreements contain specific wording on actions to be taken in the event of infringements who will take the action how will damages be distributed etc sub licensing can a trademark or service mark licensee in your jurisdiction sub license use of the mark to a third party if so does the right to sub license exist statutorily or must it be granted contractually if it exists statutorily can the licensee validly waive its right to sub license benelux trademark law does not allow or prohibit sub licensing as such trademark licences fall within the scope of contractual relations which are executed between the contracting parties as a consequence the licensor should give permission to the licensee for the granting of sub licences further it is recommended that the licensor and licensee agree on the consequences of the sub licence term conditions royalties etc in order to avoid disputes over time jointly owned intellectual property if intellectual property in your jurisdiction is jointly owned is each co owner free to deal with that intellectual property as it wishes without the consent of the other co owners are co owners of intellectual property rights able to change this position in a contract on the basis of general civil law the main rule is that co owners only have a joint authority there are some exceptions to this main rule each co owner is entitled to use all community assets on condition that this use is compatible with the rights of the other co proprietors ordinary maintenance operations and operations to preserve the assets of the community of property and in general operations that cannot be postponed without causing damage may be performed by all co owners if necessary independently and every co owner is entitled to file legal claims and to lodge legal applications at the court in order to get a judicial decision on behalf of the community of property however the co owners may make a contractual arrangement for the enjoyment the use and the administration of the community assets and deviate from the above mentioned main rules in addition to these main rules there are some specific regulations following from the several intellectual property laws such rules precede the general civil rules the benelux convention for intellectual property 2005 does not know specific rules for the co ownership of a trademark general civil law applies the dutch copyright act states that where two or more persons own the joint copyright in one and the same work any one of them may enforce the right unless otherwise agreed this rule is similar to general civil law the dutch patent act 1995 also knows a specific regulation for co ownership for registered patents it states that if various persons are jointly entitled to a patent their mutual relationship shall be governed by an agreement made between them if no such agreement has been made or if the agreement does not provide otherwise any person entitled to the patent shall have the right to solely use maintain and exploit the patent however a licence may be granted only with the joint consent of the persons entitled to the patent first to file is your jurisdiction a first to file or first to invent jurisdiction can a foreign licensor license the use of an invention subject to a patent application but in respect of which the patent has not been issued in your jurisdiction the netherlands has a first to file system patent applications can be licensed if the patent is not granted the licensor may terminate the agreement the licensor may only continue to collect royalties if the licensor continues to make certain efforts for the benefit of the licensee usually the parties will make the validity of the licence conditional upon the patent being granted scope of patent protection can the following be protected by patents in your jurisdiction software business processes or methods living organisms the 1995 dutch patent act explicitly excludes software and business processes or methods from protection however the courts in europe are becoming more and more lenient in granting patents for software and business processes or methods if the invention meets certain technical standards microorganisms bacteria etc can in general be patented patenting animal and plant species is difficult but it is possible to patent inventions that are applicable in animals as well as a wide variety of animals and plants in which a certain invention has been applied eg all plants that are resistant against a certain herbicide trade secrets and know how is there specific legislation in your jurisdiction that governs trade secrets or know how if so is there a legal definition of trade secrets or know how in either case how are trade secrets and know how treated by the courts with the acceptance of directive 2016 943 eu trade secrets as per 5 july 2016 eu member states had a maximum of two years to incorporate the directive s provisions into domestic law the dutch senate accepted the draft trade secrets law wet bescherming bedrijfsgeheimen on 16 october 2018 the law entered into force on 23 october 2018 the definition of a trade secret in dutch law corresponds with the definition in the above mentioned directive the courts will treat the trade secrets more or less the same as ip rights with regard to licence agreements commission regulation ec no 772 2004 technology transfer block exemption regulations defines know how as basically secret substantial and identified as know how or trade secrets are not intellectual property rights directive 2004 48 ec enforcement as implemented into dutch law does not apply to cases on the subject cases of unauthorised disclosure of know how and trade secrets are usually dealt with as tort such as unfair competition or breach of contract such as non disclosure agreements employment agreements or otherwise pursuant to case law if the disclosing party has not made clear that the information is confidential it cannot qualify as know how the confidential nature cannot be assumed merely based on the relationship between the parties does the law allow a licensor to restrict disclosure or use of trade secrets and know how by the licensee or third parties in your jurisdiction both during and after the term of the licence agreement is there any distinction to be made with respect to improvements to which the licensee may have contributed yes the parties can and often do agree that disclosure is restricted and know how remains confidential even after the term of the licence agreement however holding a licensee to such an arrangement while the know how has meanwhile become public knowledge through no fault of the licensee may be in conflict with competition rules for improvements to which the licensee has contributed such an arrangement would only work if the licensee assigned its rights to the improvements to the licensor or if it has granted an exclusive perpetual licence to the licensor to use the improvements note that a specific law with regard to trade secrets entered into force on 23 october 2018 see question 17 copyright what constitutes copyright in your jurisdiction and how can it be protected pursuant to the dutch copyright act works of literature science or art can be protected by copyright this includes an unlimited variety of works including literary musical and audiovisual works as well as software to qualify for protection the work has to have its own original character and bear the personal stamp of the author the work must be the author s own intellectual creation and cannot be derived from an existing work ideas are not protected the work must be in tangible form copyrights allow the author to object to the unauthorised making public or reproducing of the work and include moral rights copyrights arise upon creation of the work and last for 70 years after the death of the author or after its publication if the author is a company software licensing perpetual software licences does the law in your jurisdiction recognise the validity of perpetual software licences if not or if it is not advisable for other reasons are there other means of addressing concerns relating to perpetual licences dutch law does not prohibit perpetual software licences however perpetual licences might not be preferable after the decision of the cjeu in usedsoft v oracle 3 july 2012 c 128 11 which has been confirmed since in that case oracle objected to usedsoft s resale of oracle licences for standard software which licences usedsoft had acquired from oracle licensees albeit in violation by the licensee of its contractual obligation not to transfer the licence the court sided with usedsoft and ruled that oracle had exhausted its rights to distribute the software as it had sold the first copy of the software in the european union the court held that if the licence has been granted for an unlimited period of time and for a one time fee representing the economic value of the software such a transaction actually involves a transfer of the ownership of the software copy and therefore constitutes a sale as a consequence a perpetual licence which will have a one time fee will be regarded as a sale the licensor is therefore better off granting a licence for the term of the agreement and at recurring fees legal requirements are there any legal requirements to be complied with prior to granting software licences including import or export restrictions no although depending on the sector and the kind of software there may be restrictions in the area of dual use when a certain component also has or could have a military use or purpose restrictions on users are there any legal restrictions in your jurisdiction with respect to the restrictions a licensor can put on users of its software in a licence agreement parties are to a great extend free to set the conditions for a software licence however the dutch copyright act stipulates that reverse engineering and decompiling of software is allowed insofar as necessary for interoperability of the licensed software with other applications this cannot be excluded in a licence agreement furthermore depending on the activities or processes that occur under the licence this could give rise to privacy issues and thus fall within the general data protection regulation royalties and other payments currency conversion and taxes relevant legislation is there any legislation that governs the nature amount or manner or frequency of payments of royalties or other fees or costs including interest on late payments in an international licensing relationship or require regulatory approval of the royalty rate or other fees or costs including interest on late payments payable by a licensee in your jurisdiction no there is no specific legislation on royalties nor is regulatory approval required the parties can contractually agree on interest for late payment and payment terms without such an agreement the dutch statutory interest rate in commercial matters as from 1 july 2013 applies currently at 8 0 per cent per year and payments between companies must be made within 30 days for transactions with consumers an annual rate of 3 per cent applies directive 2011 7 eu to prevent payment delays in commercial agreements was implemented by the act of 16 march 2013 the act only applies to professional parties not to consumers even though professional parties can agree upon payment terms the act provides that only under exceptional circumstances is a payment term exceeding 60 days allowed when dealing with governmental bodies the maximum payment term is 30 days and can only be extended under exceptional circumstances but never exceeding 60 days a creditor can claim 40 as minimum compensation for recovery costs restrictions are there any restrictions on transfer and remittance of currency in your jurisdiction are there are any associated regulatory reporting requirements no there are no restrictions or reporting requirements taxation of foreign licensor in what circumstances may a foreign licensor be taxed on its income in your jurisdiction a corporate foreign licensor will become liable to netherlands corporate income tax as a foreign taxpayer if the corporate foreign licensor conducts an enterprise in the netherlands via a permanent establishment and the intellectual property assets subject to the licence can be attributed to that permanent establishment in that event the netherlands will levy 20 per cent corporate income tax on the first 200 000 of profits of the permanent establishment and 25 per cent corporate income tax on the profits exceeding 200 000 the netherlands does not levy withholding tax on royalties competition law issues restrictions on trade are practices that potentially restrict trade prohibited or otherwise regulated in your jurisdiction yes within the netherlands and the european union practices that restrict trade are prohibited commission regulation eu no 330 2010 on vertical agreements provides the relevant framework for the competition law assessment of all licence agreements with an effect on trade between eu member states the commission regulation on vertical agreements inter alia prohibits resale price maintenance as well as certain restrictions regarding the territory or group of customers that can be served it is prohibited to limit passive sales from a licensee or reseller not being the end user which includes sales via the internet see question 27 it also restricts the duration of a contract in the event that it contains a non compete clause further commission regulation eu no 772 2004 on the application of article 101 3 of the treaty to categories of technology transfer agreements commission regulation eu no 316 2014 technology transfer might apply the latter commission regulation includes restrictions on exclusive grant back obligations for severable improvements whether such provisions are allowed must be determined individually legal restrictions are there any legal restrictions in respect of the following provisions in licence agreements duration exclusivity internet sales prohibitions non competition restrictions and grant back provisions yes see question 26 pursuant to the commission regulation on vertical agreements the licensor may in principle not restrict or prohibit its licensee or reseller not being the end user to sell or resell licences to its customers via the internet internet sales qualify as passive sales that may not be prohibited however the cjeu in coty parfumerie akzente 6 december 2017 c 230 16 ruled that a selective distribution system that is primarily aimed at maintaining the luxury image of the products offered is allowed provided the resellers are selected based on non discriminatory objective criteria under such circumstances the distributor may prohibited the reselling of its luxury products through certain online platforms that would not fit the luxury image furthermore since competition laws continually evolve and licensing arrangements can be rather specific and also as they could both fall within the scope of the commission regulation on vertical agreements or the commission regulation on technology transfer as well as under national competition laws each specific matter should be assessed individually ip related court rulings have courts in your jurisdiction held that certain uses or abuses of intellectual property rights have been anticompetitive on 8 september 2016 the eu general court fully upholding the eu commission s decision that the danish pharmaceutical company lundbeck and four generic competitors had concluded agreements that harmed patients and healthcare systems in 2002 lundbeck agreed with these four other companies to delay their market entry of cheaper generic versions of lundbeck s branded citalopram a blockbuster antidepressant these agreements violated eu antitrust rules that prohibit anticompetitive agreements article 101 of the tfeu it is the first time that it is ruled that pharma pay for delay agreements breach eu antitrust rules indemnification disclaimers of liability damages and limitation of damages indemnification provisions are indemnification provisions commonly used in your jurisdiction and if so are they generally enforceable is insurance coverage for the protection of a foreign licensor available in support of an indemnification provision indemnification provisions are common and are generally enforceable however dutch courts may always mitigate any penalties agreed upon insurance coverage is usually available depending of course on the precise needs and risks waivers and limitations can the parties contractually agree to waive or limit certain types of damages are disclaimers and limitations of liability generally enforceable what are the exceptions if any yes parties can contractually agree to waive or limit certain types of damages as well as maximise the amount disclaimers are generally enforceable unless deemed unacceptable under the given circumstances based on the principle of reasonableness and fairness see question 3 this can especially be the case if there is serious inequality between the contracting parties further liability resulting from intent or gross negligence of the higher management of a company cannot be excluded or limited termination right to terminate does the law impose conditions on or otherwise limit the right to terminate or not to renew an international licensing relationship or require the payment of an indemnity or other form of compensation upon termination or non renewal more specifically have courts in your jurisdiction extended to licensing relationships the application of commercial agency laws that contain such rights or remedies or provide such indemnities dutch law does not restrict or limit the right to terminate a licence agreement however this does not mean that a party can always terminate the agreement and even if it can it may be obliged to respect a certain notice period or pay compensation or indemnity or both a contract with an indefinite term may in principle be terminated for convenience this is the prevailing opinion recently affirmed by the dutch supreme court however under certain circumstances a party may have to show cause to terminate the agreement in any case a reasonable notice period must always be observed the length of which depends on the circumstances of the matter although standard practice was that courts granted notice periods of up to six to 12 months some recent higher court decisions imposed notice periods of two to three years even when the contract stated a shorter period further the terminating party may have to compensate the other party for investments or costs made which the other party may lose owing to the termination a licensing structure can under certain circumstances be qualified as a commercial agency relationship in the netherlands important criteria to determine this are is the licensee or sub licensor i a reseller or ii an intermediary does the licensee or sub licensor i establish the reseller prices itself or ii are they being fixed by the licensor does the licensee or sub licensor i earn a margin between the purchase price and the resale price or ii a commission fee for all licences sold does the licensee or sub licensee i receive the licence fees from customers or ii are they collected by the licensor the more questions that are answered with ii the more likely that a court will deem there to be a commercial agency relationship in which event a goodwill compensation may be payable upon termination of the licence agreement impact of termination what is the impact of the termination or expiration of a licence agreement on any sub licence granted by the licensee in the absence of any contractual provision addressing this issue would a contractual provision addressing this issue be enforceable in either case without a contractual provision the sub licence agreement ends upon the licence agreement ending this may however result in the sub licensor committing a material breach towards its sub licensee if this situation was not properly addressed in the sub licence agreement a contractual provision arranging for termination of the sub licence upon ending of the licence agreement would clarify the position of the parties from the outset and would indeed be enforceable bankruptcy impact of licensee bankruptcy what is the impact of the bankruptcy of the licensee on the legal relationship with its licensor and any sub licence that the licensee may have granted can the licensor structure its international licence agreement to terminate it prior to the bankruptcy and remove the licensee s rights a licensor can include the contractual right to terminate the agreement prior to the licensee s bankruptcy such clauses are common and usually valid without an explicit termination arrangement in the event of a bankruptcy of the licensee the licence remains in place and also a sub licence will not automatically terminate in such event impact of licensor bankruptcy what is the impact of the bankruptcy of the licensor on the legal relationship with its licensee and any sub licence the licensee has granted are there any steps a licensee can take to protect its interest if the licensor becomes bankrupt the position of the licensee in a bankruptcy of the licensor not entirely clear under dutch law there is case law regarding the position of tenants in the bankruptcy of the landlord which has absent of specific case law regarding licensing matters been suggested to apply to licensing as well although the opinions in legal literature differ the effect of the existing case law when applied to licensing could be that if the licensee does not default under the licence agreement the receiver of the bankrupt estate of licensor remains bound by the licence agreement the receiver may however sell the subject of the licence eg software it is questionable whether the licence follows the sale and licensee and sub licensee may invoke their licence towards the third party purchasing the software as licences only have third party effect when registered licences to trademarks and patents can be registered in the respective registers thus creating such a third party effect but copyright licences which includes software licences cannot be registered as there is no copyright register in the netherlands the position of a licensee or sub licensee confronted with a bankrupt licensor can therefore depending on the subject of the licence be unclear under dutch law governing law and dispute resolution restrictions on governing law are there any restrictions on an international licensing arrangement being governed by the laws of another jurisdiction chosen by the parties pursuant to article 3 of regulation ec no 593 2008 rome i contracting parties can choose the law of another country but remain bound by mandatory provisions of the country to which the matter exclusively relates eg for two dutch contracting parties the territory is the netherlands further parties cannot exclude the applicable eu competition laws and other specific mandatory rules of law such as goodwill compensation in commercial agency relationships contractual agreement to arbitration can the parties contractually agree to arbitration of their disputes instead of resorting to the courts of your jurisdiction if so must the arbitration proceedings be conducted in your jurisdiction or can they be held in another yes the parties can jointly choose to submit a case to arbitration rather than to the dutch courts the choice for arbitration has to be made in writing the arbitration can be conducted in a foreign country and a foreign language collective or class action arbitration is not addressed unlike class action claims before a court in the dutch code of civil procedure dccp besides the well known international arbitration institute for commercial disputes like the international chamber of commerce icc arbitration one can also choose for arbitration in accordance with the netherlands arbitration institute nai nai arbitration will generally be a lot cheaper than icc arbitration and has a good reputation see www nai nl org en for information technology licence disputes there is the dutch stichting geschillenoplossing automatisering a foundation for the resolution of information and communications technology disputes see www sgoa eu english services arbitration specifically for disputes in the field of international distribution intended in the wide sense of the term comprising agency distributorship franchising selective distribution etc there is the recently established international distribution institute arbitration project created in 2016 by the international distribution institute in collaboration with the chamber of commerce of geneva and the swiss chambers arbitration institution see www idiproject com content idarb idi arbitration project with this in mind to conduct court proceedings before the dutch courts will be generally much cheaper than going through arbitration and will be objective and generally of similar quality so unless there is a specific reason to choose for arbitration for instance when it is very important that the proceedings will not be made public or when the nature of the relationship or content is very confidential the dutch court will be appropriate and is often preferred enforceability would a court judgment or arbitral award from another jurisdiction be enforceable in your jurisdiction is your jurisdiction party to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards regulation ec no 1215 2012 applies to the recognition of foreign judgments in the netherlands consequently a judgment from another eu court is enforceable with regard to non eu judgments articles 985 to 994 of the dccp apply such a judgment can be executed upon approval of a dutch court however if no bilateral treaty applies the matter should be brought before a dutch court which will then decide upon the claim article 431 of the dccp if the foreign judgment is similar to the outcome under dutch law the dutch court may rule in conformity with the foreign judgment the netherlands is a party to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 new york convention a foreign arbitration award will be enforced as per article 1076 of the dccp unless there are reasons for refusal pursuant to the convention injunctive relief is injunctive relief available in your jurisdiction may it be waived contractually if so what conditions must be met for a contractual waiver to be enforceable may the parties waive their entitlement to claim specific categories of damages in an arbitration clause yes injunctive relief is available in the netherlands both without the defendant being involved ex parte as well as between the parties inter partes the parties may contractually waive their right to injunctive relief although this is rather uncommon in fact often when parties choose arbitration they also include the right to obtain injunctive relief for a contractual waiver to be enforceable it must be unambiguous that the waiving party wishes to waive its right this can be the case if the waiving party has given the clear impression that it will not invoke a certain right however for evidentiary purposes we recommend that the waiver is done in writing the right to claim certain types of damages may also be excluded updates trends updates trends updates and trends at the beginning of 2015 the ministry of economic affairs appointed a drafting committee for a dutch franchise code consisting of two members representing franchisee interests two members representing the interests of franchisors and assisted in this by two members from the ministry of economic affairs the activities of the drafting committee have initially led to the presentation on 16 june 2015 of a consultation version of the dutch franchise code after which stakeholders were given a period of only six weeks to submit their input to the code this procedure has led to a great deal of criticism on the part of franchisors who felt they were not consulted and who had given no mandate for the far reaching obligations contained in the particular code other parties too such as branch associations and similar organisations objected to the draft code the minister then decided work on the franchise code should be continued with greater support from the ministry this has led to the present version of the dutch franchise code presented to the minister by the drafting committee on 17 february 2016 in october 2016 the minister stated he is in favour of transforming the current dutch franchise code into franchise law in the dutch civil code and this has lead to the publication of a draft franchise bill for consultation during the consultation many objections were raised against the draft bill in the mean time a new government has been installed and the draft bill has been put on hold the new government has announced a new draft franchise bill will be presented in december 2018 for consultation it is very uncertain what this new draft bill will entail as the definition of franchise in the dutch franchise code is rather broad those developments could besides franchise relationships also affect distribution and license relationships in the netherlands

gaap financial measures rga uses a non gaap financial measure called adjusted operating income as a basis for analyzing financial results this measure also serves as a basis for establishing target levels and awards under rga s management incentive programs management believes that adjusted operating income on a pre tax and after tax basis better measures the ongoing profitability and underlying trends of the company s continuing operations primarily because that measure excludes substantially all of the effect of net investment related gains and losses as well as changes in the fair value of certain embedded derivatives and related deferred acquisition costs these items can be volatile primarily due to the credit market and interest rate environment and are not necessarily indicative of the performance of the company s underlying businesses additionally adjusted operating income excludes any net gain or loss from discontinued operations the cumulative effect of any accounting changes uncertain tax positions and other tax related items and other items that management believes are not indicative of the company s ongoing operations the definition of adjusted operating income can vary by company and is not considered a substitute for gaap net income book value per share excluding the impact of aoci is a non gaap financial measure that management believes is important in evaluating

thailand and other asian countries need stronger domestic defences against global economic challenges even if us china trade war is settled amid unfavourable external economic conditions and political uncertainties at home the outlook is dimming for thailand and other asian countries facing an export slowdown linked to weak trade and demand growth globally the world bank the international monetary fund imf and the united nations economic and social commission for asia and the pacific un escap have all conceded recently that the prolonged us china trade dispute is affecting global economic growth in its third downgrade since october the imf now expects the world economy to grow by 3 3 in 2019 that would be the weakest since 2009 a year after the lehman brothers collapse touched off a recession in many developed nations the latest world bank projection released last week is for expansion in developing east asia and the pacific to soften from 6 3 in 2018 to 6 in 2019 and 2020 amid global headwinds and the continued gradual policy guided slowdown in china this is a delicate moment for the global economy chief economist gita gopinath said following the release of the imf s semi annual world economic report earlier this month citing trade tensions and financial tightening last year as the main reasons andrew mason the world bank s acting chief economist for east asia and the pacific noted that the risks to global growth remain firmly tilted to the downside where there is considerable uncertainty around the outlook especially with the indication that global demand is softening the imf sees more than two thirds of the expected slowdown in 2019 stemming from developed economies notably the european union and the uk this will mean sleepless nights for exporters in asia pacific if demand from both china and europe slows at the same time in comparison to nominal trade growth that has recovered to double digit rates real trade growth actually stayed in the single digit levels and export growth in particular were below 4 in 2018 said mia mikic director of the trade investment and innovation division at escap looking at the data for 2019 so far she believes an end is already in sight to the recovery that started nicely in 2018 and ended five years of contraction external front one of the few hopeful signs is that after months of negotiations following a truce in december the united states and china are inching closer to a trade agreement enforcement remains a key talking point according to treasury secretary mnuchin who will join us trade representative robert lighthizer at a new round of talks in beijing starting tomorrow the important thing is that the trade war is not escalating said tim leelahaphan an economist at standard chartered bank in thailand last year china seemed to be the only side that was hit by the trade war he told asia focus this year the us is sharing the same concern as the world is also slowing down which means that an agreement might be on the horizon based on that shared concern in 2019 the most problematic continent is going to be europe as us economic numbers are still looking strong while china is heading in a better direction when compared to last year tim leelahaphan standard chartered bank thailand don nakornthab senior director of the economic and policy department at the bank of thailand agreed the us china talks were encouraging and while new trade conflict between the us and europe is a possibility that should not affect this region too much president donald trump has lately threatened that the us would impose tariffs on us 11 billion worth of european products amid rising tensions over a long running dispute over aircraft subsidies in any case mr tim said there will be more focus on europe as brexit is a significant concern for asia what we want to highlight more than the trade war is brexit which we have given more weight to this year he said in 2019 the most problematic continent is going to be europe as us economic numbers are still looking strong while china is heading in a better direction when compared to last year china has committed huge sums to economic stimulus packages since last year to stay on the path to growth with 6 4 expansion in the first quarter beating expectations still the imf is predicting 6 3 growth for all of 2019 and 6 1 in 2020 compared with 6 6 in 2018 the euro zone however is facing bigger headwinds with growth forecasts of 1 3 this year and 1 5 next year versus 1 8 in 2018 when many analysts believed the region had finally embarked on a recovery the euro has been trending lower since the beginning of the year where brexit is the problem in the uk but europe has large exposure to the uk since it is one of the important trading partners for the uk second only to the us mr tim said eu leaders have extended the brexit deadline until oct 31 but questions will remain about the british economy even if the risk of a no deal exit has receded brexit has so consumed the attention of uk politicians and policymakers that economic growth nearly ground to a halt in the first quarter the british chambers of commerce said recently citing a survey of 7 000 businesses as a result standard chartered now expects china us trade tensions to take a back seat with brexit and europe in the front seat driving global growth down said mr tim around 12 of thailand s total exports go to china and another 10 go to the eu but thailand s exports have been hit by the global trade war and that has already transpired into a contraction in the past three to four months which means that thailand s external front is weakening he said if there is another slowdown coming from europe the export contraction could be worse the us dollar value of exports in the first quarter contracted 1 64 from the same period last year to 61 98 billion according to commerce ministry data imports also contracted 1 2 to 59 98 billion nevertheless the ministry is still sticking with its export growth forecast of 8 this year compared to 6 7 in 2018 in march export value fell 4 9 year on year to 21 4 billion after a 5 9 rise in february that was inflated by shipments of weapons that had been brought into the country earlier for the cobra gold military exercises without the weapons exports would have contracted by 4 9 pimchanok vonkorpon director general of the ministry s trade policy and strategy office said the contraction in march was largely due to a slowdown in global trade shipments to most markets in the first two months of 2019 were in the red exports to the us surged 51 8 year on year mainly because of the weapons shipments exports to the clmv markets cambodia laos myanmar and vietnam inched up 0 1 to 4 3 billion but even without the weapons shipments thai exports to the us have been reasonably healthy suggesting that some economies in asia are gaining as a result of the trade war either from increased demand from the us or china but this will not offset the overall slowdown in global trade said mr tim risks to global growth remain firmly tilted to the downside says andrew mason world bank acting chief economist for east asia and the pacific he noted that demand for thai products from china the eu and asean has fallen since the beginning of the year exports to asean the country s largest partner contracted by 3 in the first two months exports to the us might have increased by 50 year on year in the first two months but our overall total market is still flat he said so yes we have gained some benefit from the increase of exports to the us market but if global demand continues to slow down then all pros that we might gained will not outweigh all the cons sluggish export performance has prompted the central bank to reduce its export growth forecast for 2019 to 3 from 7 previously predicted it has also lowered its gdp growth projection to 3 8 from 4 1 the siam commercial bank economic intelligence center has also trimmed its forecast to 3 6 from 3 8 while kasikorn research center revised down its figure from 4 to 3 7 the downgrades reflect the fact that the thai economy remains heavily dependent n exports which account for almost 70 of gdp we can see that trade is weakening all over the region asean at the moment said mr tim countries that have large exposure to the trade war without the benefits will be affected the most but in the end we will all be affected from the slowdown in global demand mr don said thailand needs economic reform to create a system that relies less on external demand and concentrates more on the domestic front and while domestic demand is improving it has to be more sustained what happened with the trade war makes you realise that you cannot let yourself be at the mercy of international trends he said you ve got to make domestic more resilient and strong where reform is the key he said adding that easiest ways to increase internal demand is through infrastructure development internal challenges given all the global challenges an effective home defence is crucial for asia but some asian economies are also weakening internally with politics a factor in some cases amid ongoing external issues the way that countries in asia will be able to grow is internally where their domestic market has to be strong to counter the gusting global headwinds but one theme for asia this year is elections mr tim said thailand and indonesia have already voted and india is halfway through six weeks of polling but great uncertainty persists he said the highest level of political uncertainty is in thailand as the country awaits official results on may 9 with two competing sides neck and neck in efforts to form a coalition government in any case policy continuity will be crucial for business and investment confidence improving domestic demand is the best way to reduce external risk says don nakornthab senior director of the economic and policy department at the bank of thailand photo courtesy of bank of thailand everybody in the region has external headwinds said mr don the key for thailand is to keep on with our infrastructure building regardless of what uncertainty we are having it is crucial for the current government or the next government to make sure that infrastructure projects especially the eec eastern economic corridor continue because that will boost domestic demand and provide opportunity for investment in india prime minister narendra modi and his bharatiya janata party bjp are facing a stiffer challenge from congress and regional opposition groups than they encountered five years ago it is far from clear whether the bjp will prevail when results are announced on may 23 the consensus is saying that the bjp could win the election but without a strong majority as before so we have to wait and see if they are coming back and how strong they will be mr tim said in indonesia president joko widodo finished 10 percentage points ahead of challenger prabowo subianto on april 17 though the latter is still challenging the results but uncertainties remain in terms of mr widodo s commitment to push reform policies however mr tim said the level of uncertainty in thailand remains much higher than it is in indonesia or even in india we have to be strong domestically because the global headwinds are strong but there is also domestic uncertainty on the political front of key asian countries he said the political situation in these three countries might not be a key risk right now but if there is more uncertainty it could affect their domestic situation coupled with a strong external headwind that means we might have to be more conservative with our economic outlook here
new york april 26th gross domestic product growth for the first quarter of 2018 or â 2019q1 gdpâ printed at a stunning 3 2 smashing well past the consensus estimate of 2 by 120 bps thatâ s 100 bps above the final 2 2 reading of the last quarter and also the 2 2 of the comparable period last year average gdp growth for the last four quarters printed at 3 3 percent that compares to average gdp growth for the prior four quarters 2017q2 to 2018q1 was 2 6 we had anticipated growth in the first quarter at between 1 9 and 2 4 percent growth in line with the consensus we had lowered the range in our march jobs report by 10bps the biggest gainer in gdp categories were net exports â nexâ and gross domestic investment â gdiâ weâ re always circmspect about the nex number as it is the one that is most frequently revised and especially since the percentage change in 2019q1 nex is substantially higher than other quarters in recent years we did not see substantial changes in the first two months of 2019q1 to warrant confidence that the u s is moving into an export boom as illustrated below it is mostly a strong recovery from a negative prior 2018q4 and thus merely a timing difference gdi had excellent growth in intellectual property 0 39 and non residential construction 0 39 personal consumption expenditures or pce growh declined by more than half to just 0 82 from 1 66 in 2018q4 but above the paltry 0 36 percent from 2018q1 what had been the lowest pce quarter in recent years we had anticipated pce to grow in the range of 1 2 to 1 7 percent thoughout 2019 and be a bigger contributor to the economy but the precipitous dip in consumer confidence during the government shutdown 12 22 2018 to 1 22 2019 likely affected pce summary analysis we were not surprised to see 2018q4 print in the lower end of the range we predicted but we were frankly stunned by this morningâ s print short term still based on all we see we expect 2019 q2 to print only in the range of 2 5 to 3 0 percent watch for our monthly jobs reports where we go through multiple datapoints for revisions up or down on that number the ibd tipp index of economic optimism for april dropped to just 54 2 just moderately expansionary we continued to be troubled by continuing volatility and flattening in the 3mo 10yr yield curve which has been narrowing on and off since the end of 2017 in march the two terms had inverted a handful of times and continue to remain very narrow at less than 15 bps or less for all but one day of april it ended at just 11 bps on thursday moreover the 10 year seems to be continuing its overall decline and struggles to keep above the 2 5 rate the continuing decline in the 10 year shows a that investors are moving toward bonds moving cash from equities to treasuries and b slow european and asian economies are moving to us treasuries as dollar flows are moving toward the us m2 velocity is still fairly flat though up somewhat from 2017q3 medium term we remain somewhat pessimistic over the medium term because we see recent distinct signs of a slowing economy and the extraordinarily high nex number this quarther is likelly an outlier inflation remains low seemingly inapposite to the dogma of the philips curve likewise a low interest rate environment and a low m2 velocity in a relatively high growth economy seems contrary to the quantity theory of money mv pq sometimes written as mv pt weâ re of the view that both of these rules are affected and possibly obsoleted by the fed now paying interest on excess reserves something in had not done prior to 2008 this is because more of money is being kept in the banking system at the fed than in the regular economy weâ ve never had that before some older economic theorems may now be consigned to the dustbin we expect exports and consumer spending to return to rates consistent with the averages of the results weâ ve seen in prior results weâ ve seen since the great recession 50bps we expect similar levels of inventory build which would make gdp much more modest in the 2 3 to 2 8 percent range or lower in mid 2019 long term our long term view of the economy beyond 2022q1 remains unchanged aside from ai thereâ s very little in this economy we see on the horizon to create rapid robust growth the â next big thingâ in the way of a product or service that ramps up a sustained substantial uptick in production and consumption to drive growth president trumpâ s more protectionist trade rhetoric could add foreign owned domestic production to drive gdp growth particularly in the gdi category but so far that rhetoric has mostly been a threat to induce more fair trade policies from our trading partners much remains to be seen direct foreign investment in the usa has actually declined as trade issues ramp up absent growth from some major consumer oriented innovation or some significant reshoring of manufacturing or other direct foreign investment in the usa we anticipate managers will look for growth in certain low margin industries and consolidate to realize cost savings we also expect internet retailers like amazon to realize enhanced growth by adding to their business of selling â stuffâ to their nascent business of selling â experiencesâ concert tickets airlines cruise lines car rentals theme parks hotel chains etc investment summary in equities weâ re mostly inclined to stand pat with these sectors from our 2018q4 summary but in less proportion and with some changes as follows outperform consumer discretionaries in the mid to high end retail sector trucking on speculation of consolidation and acquisition companies or reits that own real estate in sectors identified as opportunity zones under the tax cut and jobs creation act of 2017 chf perform consumer staples energy utilities telecom and materials and industrials lower end consumer discretionaries like dollar stores the asset light hospitality sector on speculation of stabilizing franchisee property values and

primarily to the origination of loans at higher market rates and adjustable rate loans repricing to higher market rates the decrease in interest income on the mbs portfolio was due to a 47 7 million decrease in the average balance of the portfolio partially offset by a four basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 2 63 for the current quarter the increase in the

related to the implementation of enhancements in the bank s information technology infrastructure the decrease in regulatory and outside services was due mainly to a decrease in audit fees the increase in advertising and promotional was due primarily to the timing of advertising campaigns and sponsorships the decrease in deposit and loan transaction costs was due mainly to a reduction in costs associated with the bank s online banking services the increase in office supplies and related expense was due mainly to the timing of such expenses the decrease in other non interest expense was due primarily to a decrease in other real estate owned oreo operations expense the company s efficiency ratio was 45 38 for the current quarter compared to 46 40 for the prior quarter the improvement in the efficiency ratio was due primarily to lower non interest expense in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter the efficiency ratio is a measure of a financial institution s total non interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income pre provision for credit losses and non interest income a lower value indicates that the financial institution is generating revenue with a proportionally lower level of expense income tax expense income tax expense was 6 9 million for the current quarter compared to 6 6 million for the prior quarter the effective tax rate was 21 9 for the current quarter compared to 21 2 for the prior quarter management estimates the effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2019 will be approximately 22 comparison of operating results for the six months ended march 31 2019 and 2018 the company recognized net income of 48 9 million or 0 36 per share for the six month period ended march 31 2019 compared to net income of 55 2 million or 0 41 per share for the six month period ended march 31 2018 the decrease in net income was due primarily to the prior year six month period including the impact of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act as discussed below as well as an increase in non interest expense these changes were partially offset by an increase in net interest income due primarily to the higher yielding loans added in the ccb acquisition the tax act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities in december 2017 to account for the lower corporate income tax rate the revaluation reduced income tax expense by 7 5 million the net interest margin increased 45 basis points from 1 85 for the prior year six month period to 2 30 for the current year six month period when the leverage strategy is in place it reduces the net interest margin due to the amount of earnings from the transaction in comparison to the size of the transaction the leverage strategy was suspended at certain times during the current year six month period due to the negative interest rate spreads between the related fhlb borrowings and cash held at the frb of kansas city making the transaction unprofitable see additional discussion regarding the leverage strategy in the financial condition section below excluding the effects of the leverage strategy the net interest margin would have increased 11 basis points from 2 22 for the prior year six month period to 2 33 for the current year six month period the increase in the net interest margin excluding the effects of the leverage strategy was due mainly to the addition of higher yielding commercial loans in the ccb acquisition interest and dividend income the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets increased 58 basis points from 3 02 for the prior year six month period to 3 60 for the current year six month period while the average balance of interest earning assets decreased 1 62 billion from the prior year six month period absent the impact of the leverage strategy the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets would have increased 29 basis points from 3 33 for the prior year six month period to 3 62 for the current year six month period and the average balance of interest earning assets would have increased 272 1 million the following table presents the components of interest and

average balance of the portfolio as well as a 20 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 3 77 for the current year six month period the increase in the average balance was due mainly to the acquisition of ccb the increase in the weighted average yield was also due mainly to the addition of higher yielding loans associated with the ccb acquisition as well as adjustable rate loans repricing to higher market rates and the origination and purchase of new loans at higher market rates the increase in interest income on the mbs portfolio was due to a 33 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 2 61 for the current year six month period along with a 48 6 million increase in the average balance of the portfolio the increase in the weighted average yield was due primarily to a decrease in the impact of net premium amortization as well as adjustable rate mbs repricing to higher market rates net premium amortization of 659 thousand during the current year six month period decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 13 basis points during the prior year six month period 1 6 million of net premiums were amortized which decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 35 basis points the decrease in dividend income on fhlb stock was due to a decrease in the average balance of fhlb stock as a result of the leverage strategy not being in place as often during the current year six month period as compared to the prior year six month period this was partially offset by a higher dividend rate on fhlb stock during the current year six month period the increase in interest income on the investment securities portfolio was due to a 75 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 2 13 the increase in the weighted average yield was primarily a result of replacing maturing securities at higher market rates the table above includes interest income on cash and cash equivalents associated and not associated with the leverage strategy interest income on cash and cash equivalents not related to the leverage strategy decreased 155 thousand from the prior year six month period due to a 98 9 million decrease in the average balance partially offset by a 97 basis point increase in the weighted average yield which was related to cash balances held at the frb of kansas city interest income on cash associated with the leverage strategy decreased 12 4 million from the prior year six month period due to a 1 80 billion decrease in the average balance as the leverage strategy was in place less often during the current year six month period interest expense the weighted average rate paid on total interest bearing liabilities increased 17 basis points from 1 32 for the prior year six month period to 1 49 for the current year six month period while the average balance of interest bearing liabilities decreased 1 58 billion from the prior year six month period absent the impact of the leverage strategy the weighted average rate paid on total interest bearing liabilities would have increased 19 basis points from 1 29 for the prior year six month period to 1 48 for the current year six month period and the average balance of interest bearing liabilities would have increased 315 2 million the following table presents the components of interest

interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a 22 basis point increase in the weighted average rate to 1 15 for the current year six month period the deposit accounts assumed in the ccb acquisition were at a lower average rate than our legacy deposit portfolio rate and our overall deposit portfolio rate which partially offset the increase in the deposit portfolio rate in the current year six month period the increase in the weighted average rate was due primarily to increases in the average retail business certificate of deposit portfolio rate and wholesale certificate of deposit portfolio rate which increased 28 basis points and 68 basis points respectively the table above includes interest expense on fhlb borrowings associated and not associated with the leverage strategy interest expense on fhlb borrowings not related to the leverage strategy increased 2 5 million from the prior year six month period due to a 19 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on the portfolio to 2 25 for the current year six month period and a 33 5 million increase in the average balance of the portfolio the increase in the weighted average rate paid was due primarily to certain maturing advances being replaced at higher effective interest rates interest expense on fhlb borrowings associated with the leverage strategy decreased 13 1 million from the prior year six month period due to the leverage strategy not being in place as often during the current year six month period the decrease in interest expense on other borrowings was due mainly to the maturity of a 100 0 million repurchase agreement during the prior fiscal year which was not replaced with a new repurchase agreement non interest income the following table presents the components of non interest

decrease in deposit service fees was due mainly to a change in the presentation of interchange network charges related to the adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard during the current year six month period previously interchange network charges were reported in deposit and loan expense upon adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard on october 1 2018 interchange transaction fee income is reported net of interchange network charges which totaled 1 7 million during the current year six month period and 1 5 million during the prior year six month period the increase in income from boli was due primarily to a one time adjustment during the prior year six month period to the benchmark rate associated with one of the policies which reduced income from boli during that period as well as to an increase in income related to policies acquired in the ccb acquisition the increase in other non interest income was due mainly to revenues from the trust asset management operations acquired from ccb additionally the prior year six month period included a loss on the sale of loans as management tested loan sale processes for liquidity purposes and there were no loan sales in the current year six month period non interest expense the following table presents the components of non interest expense for the time periods presented along with the

expense 3 190 1 766 1 424 80 6 total non interest expense 52 923 45 634 7 289 16 0 the increase in salaries and employee benefits was due primarily to 3 2 million of expense related to former ccb employees during the current year six month period as well as an increase due to salary adjustments the increase in information technology and related expense was due mainly to an increase in software licensing costs related to the integration of ccb operations and accelerated depreciation related to the implementation of enhancements to the bank s information technology infrastructure the increase in occupancy net was due primarily to expenses related to properties acquired in the ccb acquisition the increase in regulatory and outside services was due mainly to an increase in consulting expenses as well as expenses related to the acquisition of ccb the decrease in deposit and loan transaction costs was due mainly to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard as discussed above the decrease in federal insurance premium was due primarily to a decrease in average assets as a result of a reduction in the usage of the leverage strategy in the current year six month period the increase in other non interest expense was due primarily to amortization of deposit intangibles associated with the acquisition of ccb the company s efficiency ratio was 45 89 for the current year six month period compared to 41 47 for the prior year six month period the change in the efficiency ratio was due to higher non interest expense in the current year six month period compared to the prior year six month period income tax expense income tax expense was 13 5 million for the current year six month period compared to 9 3 million for the prior year six month period the effective tax rate was 21 6 for the current year six month period compared to 14 4 for the prior year six month period the increase in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year six month period was due mainly to the tax act being signed into law in december 2017 in accordance with gaap the company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities in december 2017 to account for the lower corporate tax rate which reduced income tax expenses by 7 5 million financial condition as of march 31 2019 the loans receivable portfolio net totaled 7 57 billion at march 31 2019 compared to 7 51 billion at september 30 2018 during the current year six month period the bank originated and refinanced 268 8 million of one to four family and consumer loans with a weighted average rate of 4 63 and purchased 88 9 million of one to four family loans from correspondent lenders with a weighted average rate of 4 32 the bank also originated 122 7 million of commercial loans with a weighted average rate of 4 94 and entered into commercial real estate loan participations totaling 72 6 million with a weighted average rate of 5 44 of which 37 9 million had not yet been funded as of march 31 2019 the bank is continuing to manage the size and mix of its loan portfolio while managing liquidity levels as measured by the ratio of securities and cash to total assets to a target level of approximately 15 the ratio of securities and cash to total assets was 15 7 at march 31 2019 management intends to continue to manage the size and mix of the loan portfolio by utilizing cash flows from the correspondent one to four family loan portfolio to fund commercial loan growth given the balance of total assets it is unlikely that net loan growth will substantially increase in the current environment generally over the past few years cash flows from the securities portfolio have been used primarily to purchase loans and in part to pay down fhlb advances by moving cash from lower yielding assets to higher yielding assets and repaying higher costing liabilities we have been able to maintain our net interest margin in addition to the repayment of securities the bank has emphasized growth in the deposit portfolio in part to pay down term borrowings at times the bank has utilized a leverage strategy to increase earnings in fiscal year 2019 the leverage strategy during the current year six month period involved borrowing up to 2 10 billion either on the bank s fhlb line of credit or by entering into short term fhlb advances depending on the rates offered by fhlb the borrowings were repaid prior to quarter end or earlier if the strategy was suspended the proceeds from the borrowings net of the required fhlb stock holdings which yielded 7 3 during the current year six month period were deposited at the frb of kansas city net income attributable to the leverage strategy is largely derived from the dividends received on fhlb stock holdings plus the net interest rate spread between the yield on the cash at the frb of kansas city and the rate paid on the related fhlb borrowings less applicable federal insurance premiums and estimated taxes net income attributable to the leverage strategy was 14 thousand during the current year six month period compared to 1 5 million during the prior year six month period the decrease was due mainly to the strategy being suspended for the majority of the current year six month period due to the large negative interest rate spread making the strategy unprofitable management continues to monitor the net interest rate spread and overall profitability of the strategy it is expected that the strategy will be reimplemented if it reaches a position that is profitable stockholders equity was 1 36 billion at march 31 2019 compared to 1 39 billion at september 30 2018 the 35 6 million decrease was due primarily to the payment of 77 1 million in cash dividends partially offset by net income of 48 9 million in the long run management considers a 10 ratio of stockholders equity to total assets at the bank an appropriate level of capital at march 31 2019 this ratio was 12 8 the cash dividends paid during the current year six month period totaled 0 56 per share and consisted of a 0 39 per share cash true up dividend related to fiscal year 2018 earnings per the company s dividend policy and two regular quarterly cash dividends totaling 0 17 per

each loan category in the formula analysis model the factors are reviewed by management quarterly to assess whether the factors adequately cover probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio the historical loss factors and qualitative factors continue to improve for our one to four family portfolio to the extent the commercial loan portfolio continues to grow and the inherent loss factors remain relatively constant the related acl amounts are expected to increase as well in addition to the formula analysis model management considers several other internal and external data elements when evaluating the overall adequacy of the acl management considers the overall acl to be adequate for the loan portfolio at march 31 2019 at march 31 december 31 september 30 june 30 march

associated with the advances the effective rate and wam presented include the effect of the interest rate swaps average rates and lives at march 31 2019 the bank s gap between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities projected to reprice within one year was 433 5 million or 4 54 of total assets compared to 100 6 million or 1 08 of total assets at december 31 2018 the increase in the one year gap amount was due primarily to an expected increase in cash flows from mortgage related assets compared to december 31 2018 as a result of lower interest rates as interest rates fall borrowers have more economic incentive to refinance their mortgages and agency debt issuers have more economic incentive or opportunity to exercise their call options in order to issue new debt at lower interest rates resulting in higher projected cash flows on these assets the majority of interest earning assets anticipated to reprice in the coming year are repayments and prepayments on one to four family loans and mbs both of which include the option to prepay without a fee being paid by the contract holder the amount of interest bearing liabilities expected to reprice in a given period is not typically impacted significantly by changes in interest rates because the bank s borrowings and certificate of deposit portfolios have contractual maturities and generally cannot be terminated early without a prepayment penalty if interest rates were to increase 200 basis points as of march 31 2019 the bank s one year gap is projected to be 271 1 million or 2 84 of total assets this compares to a one year gap of 419 2 million or 4 51 of total assets if interest rates were to have increased 200 basis points as of december 31 2018 the decrease in the gap compared to no change in rates is due to lower anticipated cash flows in the higher rate environment during the current quarter loan repayments totaled 233 6 million and cash flows from the securities portfolio totaled 139 3 million the majority of these cash flows were reinvested into new loans and securities at current market interest rates total cash flows from fixed rate liabilities that matured and repriced into current market interest rates during the current quarter were 293 8 million these offsetting cash flows allow the bank to manage its interest rate risk and gap position more precisely than if the bank did not have offsetting cash flows due to its mix of assets or maturity structure of liabilities other strategies include managing the bank s wholesale assets and liabilities the bank primarily uses long term fixed rate borrowings with no embedded options to lengthen the average life of the bank s liabilities the fixed rate characteristics of these borrowings lock in the cost until maturity and thus decrease the amount of liabilities repricing as interest rates move higher compared to funding with lower cost short term borrowings these borrowings are laddered in order to prevent large amounts of liabilities repricing in any one period the wal of the bank s term borrowings as of march 31 2019 was 1 5 years however including the impact of interest rate swaps related to 640 0 million of adjustable rate fhlb advances the wal of the bank s term borrowings as of march 31 2019 was 2 8 years the interest rate swaps effectively convert the adjustable rate borrowings into long term fixed rate liabilities the bank uses the securities portfolio to shorten the average life of the bank s assets security purchases over the past few years have primarily been focused on callable agency debentures with maturities no longer than five years shorter duration mbs and adjustable rate mbs these securities have a shorter average life and provide a steady source of cash flow that can be reinvested as interest rates rise into higher yielding assets in addition to the wholesale strategies the bank has sought to increase non maturity deposits and long term certificates of deposit non maturity deposits are expected to reduce the risk of higher interest rates because their interest rates are not expected to increase significantly as market interest rates rise specifically checking accounts and savings accounts have had minimal interest rate fluctuations throughout historical interest rate cycles though no assurance can be given that this will be the case in future interest rate cycles the balances and rates of these accounts have historically tended to remain very stable over time giving them the characteristic of long term liabilities the bank uses historical data pertaining to these accounts to estimate their future balances over the last few years the bank has priced long term certificates of deposit more aggressively than short term certificates of deposit with the goal of giving customers incentive to move funds into longer term certificates of deposit when interest rates were lower since december 2015 when short term interest rates began to rise the bank s portfolio of retail business certificates of deposit with terms of four years or longer has increased approximately 25 while the bank s portfolio of retail business certificates of deposit with terms of one year to four years has decreased approximately 15 long term certificates of deposit reduce the amount of liabilities repricing as interest rates rise in a given time period the following
