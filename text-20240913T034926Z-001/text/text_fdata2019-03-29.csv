of 1 2736 to 1 at 31 december 2018 and 1 3528 to 1 at 31 december 2017 the company s performance benchmark the msci em latin america index may be calculated on either a gross or a net return basis net return nr indices calculate the reinvestment of dividends net of withholding taxes using the tax rates applicable to non resident institutional investors and hence give a lower total return than indices where calculations are on a gross basis which assumes that no withholding tax is suffered as the company is subject to withholding tax rates for the majority of countries in which it invests the nr basis is felt to be the most accurate appropriate consistent and fair comparison for the company historically the benchmark data for the company has always been stated on a gross basis however going forward it is the board s intention to monitor the company s performance with reference to the nr version of the benchmark for transparency both sets of benchmark data have been provided in the performance data contained in this year end financial report the table showing the nav and share price return for the five year period to 31 december 2018 along with the benchmark return for the same period on both a gross and net basis can be found on page 3 of the annual report chairman s statement dear shareholder i am pleased to present the annual report to shareholders for the year ended 31 december 2018 market overview latin american markets were characterised by volatility in 2018 with the msci em latin america index net return with dividends reinvested falling by 6 6 stock markets in the region s largest economy brazil were marginally down over the year 0 5 but this masked a rollercoaster ride as markets fell by 18 6 in the first half of the year impacted by concerns over the presidential elections and the truck drivers strike in may the market bounced back in the second half of 2018 mainly due to the election of jair bolsonaro as president in october which investors viewed in a positive light in mexico markets fell by 15 5 over the year under review due to concerns about the election of a more populist president andres manuel lópez obrador and the re negotiation of the north american free trade agreement nafta these developments combined with interest rate increases to combat persistent inflation created a challenging climate for the domestic equity market markets in the andean region performed poorly over the year in colombia and chile markets fell by 11 5 and 19 7 respectively mainly due to commodity prices which fell on the back of concerns over chinese growth in argentina the stock market also fell by over 50 in the year with high inflation and currency weakness driving the collapse all percentages are total return in us dollar terms on 25

details of the factors affecting performance are set out in the investment manager s report gearing the board s view is that 105 of net asset value is the neutral level of gearing over the longer term and that gearing should be used actively in an approximate range of plus or minus 10 around this as measured at the time that gearing is instigated these current parameters sit within the company s gearing policy as set out in the investment policy in the annual report which states that net borrowings are not expected to exceed 25 of net assets under normal circumstances and the company s articles of association which limit net borrowings to 100 of capital and reserves average gearing for the year to 31 december 2018 was 108 7 and as at the year end the company was geared by 108 9 revenue return and dividends total revenue return for the year was 15 13 cents per share 2017 13 03 cents per share the increase was largely due to a higher level of special dividends received in the year which accounted for 2 cents per share of total revenue return 2017 0 4 cents per share with effect from july 2018 and as part of the board s overall strategy to reduce the discount at which the company s shares trade a new dividend policy was implemented whereby the company would pay a regular quarterly dividend equivalent to 1 25 of the company s us dollar nav at the end of each calendar quarter the company has paid interim dividends totalling 23 55 cents per share under this policy in respect of the year ended 31 december 2018 as detailed in the table below this represented a yield of 4 2 based on the company s share price at 31 december 2018 had the policy been in place for the full 12 month period and assuming a dividend had been paid based on 1 25 of the nav at 31 march 2018 the yield would have been 6 0 under the company s new dividend policy dividends are calculated based on 1 25 of the us dollar nav at close of business on the last working day of march june september and december and are paid in may august november and february respectively dividends will be financed through a combination of available net income in each financial year and revenue and capital reserves dividend pay date quarter to 30 june 2018 7 57 cents 23 august 2018 quarter to 30 september 2018 7 85 cents 9 november 2018 quarter to 31 december 2018 8 13 cents 8 february 2019 total 23 55

ordinary shares in sterling terms has averaged 14 5 and ranged between 10 8 and 20 6 the board has tried to reduce this volatility by offering shareholders a discount control mechanism covering the four years to 31 december 2021 whereby shareholders are offered a tender for 24 99 per cent of the shares in issue excluding treasury shares at a tender price reflecting the latest cum income nav less 2 per cent and related portfolio realisation costs in the event that the continuation vote for each relevant biennial period is approved being the continuation votes at the agms in 2020 and 2022 where

significant economic political and currency risks due to the location of the operation of the businesses in which the company may invest shares in businesses in which the company invests can prove volatile and this may be reflected in the company s share price the company may also invest in smaller capitalisation companies or in the securities markets of developing countries which are not as large as the more established securities markets and have substantially less trading volume which may result in a lack of liquidity and higher price volatility market risk includes the potential impact of events which are outside the scope of the company s control such as the uk s decision to leave the european union the board considers asset allocation stock selection unquoted investments if

company to continue for the foreseeable future and has therefore conducted this review for the period up to the agm in 2023 in choosing this period for its assessment of the viability of the company the directors have considered the following matters the company has a relatively liquid portfolio as at 31 december 2018 100 of the portfolio was estimated as being capable of being liquidated within 20 days the company s expenses and liabilities are relatively stable the company s business model should remain attractive for much longer than the period up to the agm in 2023 unless there is a significant economic or regulatory change the company s principal risks and uncertainties as set out above are unlikely to change materially the impact of a significant fall in latin american markets

manager s report market overview latin american performance was volatile throughout 2018 ending the year down 6 6 net return with dividends reinvested in usd terms making it the top performing region within the broader emerging markets complex which was down 14 6 over the same period intraregional performance was quite diverse driven by a mixture of domestic politics and negative sentiment felt across all emerging market regions brazil 0 5 the region s largest economy was subject to shifts in market sentiment for the entirety of the period whilst january was very strong with indices and flows hitting recent highs sentiment quickly tailed off following a sharp correction in the us despite improved confidence falling inflation and further central bank rate cuts in the beginning of the year brazil declined 18 6 by the end of the first half of 2018 as volatility spiked following the may truckers strike and uncertainty surrounding presidential elections grew brazil recovered sharply in the second half of the year primarily due to the election of jair bolsonaro on 28 october on this note brazil s performance resisted the sharp deterioration in global equities through the fourth quarter of 2018 with brazilian currency movements responsible for about 50 of equity gains in usd while data for the year was mixed signs of an economic rebound persist mexico 15 5 was plagued by stubborn inflation leading to a hawkish central bank earlier in the period while complexity surrounding nafta negotiations continued to put pressure on the currency although the market showed resiliency in the second quarter with uncertainty surrounding the presidential race declining volatility picked up following the cancellation of the partially built new airport in mexico city the naim project and increased concerns over how president lópez obrador s administration will try to pass policy following the transition period into 2019 performance in colombia 11 5 and chile 19 7 was primarily dictated by commodity prices which continued a downward trend into year end fuelled by concerns over chinese growth peru 1 6 was the top performer in 2018 and was the only country in the region to end in positive territory argentina was at the opposite end of the spectrum with markets declining 50 8 in 2018 a persistently strong us dollar and elevated inflation led to a collapse of both the equity and fx markets in june central bank missteps to combat rising inflation led to an initial 50bn stand by arrangement with the imf to help support the currency investors remained unconvinced of the government s economic plan leading to persistent outflows through the second half of 2018 with the exception of a short lived relief rally in the third quarter following august lows portfolio review during the year the company posted a 5 4 1 decline in its nav while its share price decreased by 6 9 1 this resulted in the nav outperformance of its benchmark the msci em latin america index which returned 6 2 1 on a gross return basis and 6 6 1 on a net return basis over the same time period 1 all calculations in us dollar terms with dividends reinvested the company s strong overweight to and selection within brazil was the primary contributor to returns as the market there rallied strongly following a positive election outcome in october and attention focused on the formation of the new government large cap macro proxies such as lender banco bradesco were among the top contributors amid continued optimism surrounding an economic recovery consumption oriented names also performed well digital retailer b2w cia digital has been able to maintain progression and positive cash flow generation on its third party marketplace while linx has benefitted from an increased demand for payment software solutions budget airline operator azul also posted stronger performance benefitting from stronger than expected traffic volumes and oil price weakness later in the period the company s underweight to chile was also additive to relative performance amid commodity price declines in the second half of 2018 on the other hand the company s off benchmark exposure to argentina was the largest detractor to performance lenders supervielle and galicia were among the most affected names as the equity and fx markets were unable to find a floor despite appropriate measures taken by the government to suppress investor concerns over runaway inflation cement producer loma negra also posted heavy declines as domestic growth slowed an underweight to colombia weighed on returns as the oil dependent market surged early in the period moving alongside oil price strength the company s leverage facility and implied 105 gross notional neutral level amplified underperformance to the benchmark portfolio positioning we notably shifted risk into mexico bringing our exposure to a more neutral position we increased some exposure to chile predominantly through mining names while exiting our peruvian exposure as we found better prospects elsewhere following a severe correction in the brazilian market over the summer due to a combination of inflation concerns stemming from the may truckers strike and spill over effects of argentina s peso crisis we added to underperforming state owned enterprises soes in brazil given significant underperformance attractive valuation and our continued belief that the october election would elect a government committed to the current economic reform process at that time we trimmed exposure to off benchmark argentina as tough fiscal and cpi consumer price index targets associated with the international monetary fund imf stand by agreement are likely to result in lower growth we continue to maintain an off benchmark allocation to argentina through software exporter globant which benefitted from persistent pressure on the currency we continued to add to our brazil overweight following a positive election result primarily topping up on existing positions in macro sensitive financials on the other hand we have remained cautious on mexico amid increased political uncertainty maintaining a neutral position we have been active in taking profits across our positions and redeploying capital on market dips most recently we have also trimmed exposure across the resource sectors the company ended the period being overweight brazil while being underweight chile peru colombia and neutral mexico at the sector level we remain overweight the domestic consumer while being underweight consumer staples and utilities in determining portfolio construction focus is given to the four c s namely commodities currency consumption and credit more detail is given below commodities moderation in global growth outlook led by china improving supply discipline favours energy sector improving economic cycle in brazil allows for exposure to brazilian steel stocks no exposure to mexican mining companies due to regulatory concerns currencies outlook for appreciation in the brazilian real and stabilization in the argentinian peso leads to above benchmark exposure to brazil and argentina uncertainty on the mexican peso leads to neutral mexico positioning pressure expected on currencies in chile and peru consumption historically low interest rates moderate inflation and improving unemployment make brazilian consumer stocks attractive the new mexican administration s social programmes should support positions in mexican beverage companies convenience stores and hypermarkets the portfolio reflects a structural shift to e commerce at the expense of department stores and shopping malls credit the low level of household and corporate indebtedness allows for supportive loan growth and low level of delinquency for the brazilian bank sector lower economic activity and expensive valuations have precluded exposure to chilean banks emphasis on financial inclusion and improving credit penetration offset policy fears in mexico outlook brazil remains our largest overweight given our positive expectations for the incoming administration so far newly elected president jair bolsonaro has delivered on his campaign promises looking to reduce the size of government by initially reducing the number of ministries naming sector subject experts to lead cabinets and pointing to a continuation of the reform process initiated two years ago meanwhile the outlook for upcoming corporate results points to a continuation in the economic recovery providing strong momentum for growth into 2019 elsewhere the cancellation of the naim airport project reminded markets of the concerns regarding increasing populism for the incoming administration in mexico reiterating our cautiousness with mexican equities we remain underweight in the andean region due to a combination of unattractive valuation and disappointing growth finally the dramatic sell off in argentina in 2018 leaves the stocks trading at attractive valuations while interest rates and fx have mostly stabilised providing a foundation for the economy to rebound from recent downturn sam vecht ed kuczma blackrock

performance against our 2019 imperatives and then i ll discuss business performance by segment i ll turn it over to john to review our financials and then finally we will wrap up the call with some closing comments and then take your questions we are off to a solid start for 2019 first quarter ebitda and eps results were in line with our expectations and our guidance despite organic revenue growth below our expectation our first quarter results demonstrated the resilience of our business model and the clear strategic positioning of h b fuller in key market segments strong pricing carryover from 2018 cost synergies and effective expense controls all helped to deliver solid performance we entered the year expecting organic revenue growth to be lower in q1 for a few reasons last year s q1 growth was unusually high 11 on a pro forma basis december the first month of our q1 was generally slow as was reported by many companies the strengthening dollar which impacted the year over year results in q1 and the planned repositioning of our construction adhesive portfolio and the slowdown in china in addition to these expected impacts our revenue was lower than forecasted primarily because of softness in our roofing business and durable assembly solutions for the housing market in the u s due to a colder winter with increased rain and snow however the overall benefit of royal synergies our pricing actions from last year and wins in key customers and targeted markets overcame the shortfalls and improved our profit performance and our organic revenues improving going forward many of the elements impacting q1 will not be a factor in q2 and the rest of the year this is all in line with the 2019 imperatives we identified at the beginning of the year in three key areas first we will deliver higher levels of ebitda margin improvement continues to be an operational focus for us in 2019 as we look to build upon the ebitda growth we achieved in 2018 you will hear this theme repeated across each of our segment we met this objective in q1 as adjusted ebitda of 83 million increased on a constant currency basis and adjusted ebitda margins of 12 increased by 40 basis points versus the first quarter of 2018 we expect ebitda trends to continue to increase during the course of the year with solid improvement in total for 2019 our second imperative is to continue to progress as planned with the integration of the royal acquisition we captured an additional three million of synergies in this quarter and we remain on track to deliver 15 million of total incremental cost synergies in 2019 our third imperative is to deliver our debt repayment commitments our debt paydown of 12 million in q1 was greater than q1 of last year just like in 2018 our cash flow from operations and the rate of our debt repayment will accelerate throughout the year based on the seasonal profile of our business thus far we have paid down 216 million in debt since the beginning of 2018 and our 200 million repayment plan in 2019 will put us ahead of our original two year plan for debt reduction now i ll cover the first quarter segment performance on slide 4 in the americas revenues were up modestly in constant currency primarily on pricing gains from 2018 and strong packaging sales these gains offset soft demand in some durable assembly areas such as doors and windows and a slowdown in demand for rvs in the u s adjusted ebitda margin of 12 improved 30 basis points year over year driven by positive pricing and lower sg a expenses eimea sales increased about 1 in constant currency with flattish overall sales in core europe and mid single digit growth in emerging markets positive pricing contribution and strong volumes from our new generation energy efficient insulating glass solution were offset by a general market slowdown in core europe in durable assembly and packaging and polymer the weaker euro british pound and turkish lira compared with the first quarter of 2018 substantially impacted reported revenue currency also negatively impacted ebitda as the weaker currencies combined with some dollar based operating costs offset underlying margin improvement asia pacific organic sales were flat strong growth in southeast asia hygiene and packaging offsets lower sales in other geographies including lower demand for durable assembly products for woodworking and textiles reflecting a softer export market we saw some stabilization in china with positive growth in the quarter although sales still lagged historical levels ebitda performance in asia pacific was very strong with a 25 year over year increase in ebitda dollars and a 250 basis point increase in ebitda margins driven by our continuous pricing portfolio and margin focus construction adhesives organic sales were off by 15 versus q1 of 2018 as we reported in the middle of last year we are moving away from underperforming products and customers in order to maximize profit performance and we forecasted a revenue decline in the quarter as a result this planned portfolio repositioning accounted for a little more than half of the decline the remainder was related to more severe weather in q1 than anticipated impacting this segment and roofing adhesives in particular low sales volume also impacted ebitda the roofing impact was pretty significant especially in late january and february for context the single ply roofing institute an independent data source reported february shipments of epdm rubber roofing membrane was down 25 compared to february of 2018 weather impacts are temporal of course and are part of what drives a significant seasonality that we manage in our fiscal first quarter every year for h b fuller our fiscal first quarter includes christmas chinese new year and weather related slowdowns in december january and february both sales and contribution margin in construction adhesives have begun to improve going into q2 lastly performance in engineering adhesives was strong ebitda dollars were up 21 and ebitda margin was up by 330 basis points to 19 driven by strong growth in the higher margin parts of our business organic revenues increased by mid single digits excluding a 4 currency impact we continue to win new applications with customers across many end markets in q1 strong growth in electronics new energy and aerospace offset lower results in automotive we forecast continued strong performance in engineering adhesives including higher organic growth in the second quarter and low double digit organic growth for the full year along with strong ebitda performance overall our bottom line performance in q1 was in line with our expectations and our guidance even as we absorbed some large unplanned weather related impacts and interruptions we are seeing improved results in the second quarter and we continue to forecast strong results in the second half of the year now let me turn the call over to john to discuss our financials and our guidance in more detail john corkrean baird analyst thanks jim i ll begin on slide 5 with some additional financial details on the first quarter net revenue was down 5 6 versus the same period last year driven by a significantly stronger dollar which negatively impacted net revenues by nearly 5 adjusting for currency organic revenue was down 1 as solid pricing carryover was offset by softness in construction related markets over the winter months and repositioning away from underperforming products and customers in the construction adhesive segment year on year adjusted gross profit margin increased 90 basis points reflecting strong pricing actions taken last year acquisition synergies and manufacturing efficiency gains adjusted selling general and administrative expense was down about 2 5 versus last year reflecting the impact of foreign currency exchange and thoughtful control of the discretionary expenses adjusted ebitda for the quarter of 83 million was in line with our expectations and guidance ebitda margin increased 40 basis points versus the same period in 2018 reflecting strong pricing carryover improved business mix manufacturing efficiency gains and expense control offsetting weaker volume in construction related markets adjusted earnings per share were 0 34 compared to 0 35 for the same period last year as improved margins good expense control and lower interest expense associated with our debt reduction actions offset significant currency headwinds versus last year with that let me now turn to our guidance for the 2019 fiscal year we continue to expect adjusted ebitda of between 465 and 485 million for the full year 2019 this represents an increase of 6 versus 2018 adjusted ebitda at the midpoint ebitda will continue to improve on the remaining three quarters based on the seasonality of our business improving volumes and moderating foreign currency exchange impact and we expect approximately 120 million to 125 million of adjusted ebitda in the second quarter we also continue to expect full year adjusted eps of between 3 15 and 3 45 this range represents growth of 10 versus the 2018 fiscal year at the midpoint of the range with that i will now turn the call back to jim owens for some closing comments jim owens president and chief executive officer thank you john our strategic plan to win business in highly engineered applications and to improve margins through effective pricing synergies and raw material costs all were executed well in q1 and continue to show positive momentum in the quarter we leveraged acquisition related synergies and the strong pricing actions that we took in 2018 along with continued customer wins in engineering adhesives and other key markets to deliver earning results and debt paydown in line with our guidance based on improving trends in several segments throughout the quarter we expect stronger organic growth in the second quarter and continued ebitda improvement throughout the year we re on track to deliver eps ebitda and debt paydown within our guidance ranges for fiscal 2019 our first quarter results show the resiliency in our business model as we build on our strategic position as a global leader in adhesives we are winning customer business and gaining share in our targeted growth markets we can t control the macro factors that occur external to our global business however we can and we are gaining share and margins through our business model of solving customers toughest adhesion problems that concludes our prepared comments for today so operator let s open up the call for some questions questions and answers operator and our first question today comes from ghansham panjabi with baird please go ahead ghansham panjabi executive vice president and chief financial officer hey guys good morning thanks for taking my questions i guess first off in the past you ve given us a volume breakdown by segment i was hoping you could do the same for the first quarter as well just trying to reconcile that 4 decline and how that kind of flowed through by segment and then also the same with price mix if you could jim owens president and chief executive officer yeah so i ll comment and maybe john can add we talked a little bit about this during our investor day the volume mix breakdown is something especially by segment on a quarter by quarter basis that really hasn t been providing enough meaningful information and the reason for that ghansham is because for any customer that we have we can change the product the price the packaging as well as the amount of adhesive that that customer uses so we look specifically at organic revenue as the big driver of our business this has gotten even more important as we ve integrated royal we sell adhesives in 30 ccs up to 10 trucks so this volume metrics i think were creating a lot of noise on a quarter by quarter basis that weren t really driving and that s why we ve stopped doing it on a segment basis by quarter but we still report it for the overall business as well so john do you want to add something to that john corkrean baird analyst yeah i mean i think we try to give a little color in the script too but just maybe to reemphasize it i d say in the regional adhesives markets it s very similar picture to q4 with pricing really driving the net impact there with a little attrition in volume similar to what we saw in q4 engineering adhesives is volume driven right and that s been the case and construction is really a volume story as well so hopefully that gives you some color ghansham panjabi executive vice president and chief financial officer that s helpful and then just from a high level basis obviously i mean volumes did step down meaningfully in the first quarter versus the previous quarterly run rate probably lower than you thought during initial when you constructed the guidance for 19 i guess what are the offsets that give you confidence in your reiterated guidance is it lower raw material cost is it something that you re seeing from a synergy standpoint or commercialization etc what are the offsets that give you confidence on the guidance jim owens president and chief executive officer yes thanks ghansham yes as we pointed out some of the things that happened in q1 are going away in q2 right so from an organic revenue standpoint but more importantly i think even in that kind of environment where we had weaker organic revenues the benefits of raw materials and the benefits of royal synergies are flowing through our p l so i think the combination of an improving trend if you look at the quarter december was a problem for us as it was for other people it continued to improve and we see that continuing to improve here into march so the top line has definitely improved as the quarter went on the roofing impacts which were sizable for our business go away but i think most importantly why we have a lot of optimism is because of what s underlying in our business stronger margin performance due to raw materials and the synergies taking effect as we go forward ghansham panjabi executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim thanks john operator and our next question comes from dmitry silversteyn with buckingham research please go ahead with your question dmitry silversteyn buckingham research analyst good morning thank you for taking my question a couple of things that i kind of wanted to get into the construction products transformation that you guys are undergoing so you talked about a little bit over half of the decline being caused by you walking away from some business or however you want to term it i guess what i m trying to understand is how long is this pruning going to last as far as it being overwhelmed if you will or overwhelming the growth in your other businesses and resulting in slower behavior for the division overall and also as you are executing this transformation are you running into any kind of equipment or capacity issues where i m assuming you re making smaller batches of higher volume or higher margin products and that s part of your transformation is your equipment and your plant setup and processes are they aligning with that type of a transformation or is there work that needs to be done there on the capex side jim owens president and chief executive officer ok great yes thanks for that question dmitry it s a good one for us to spend a little time explaining i think a good thing to do is look at our q4 in terms of what happened in our results so we had a decline in revenue but an improvement in ebitda and i think if we hadn t had this roofing effect you d see that same kind of effect this quarter you would have actually seen ebitda up on lower revenue and so it was really about defining those pieces of our business there s business we were supplying that was very high volume bulk business that was ultimately negative profit once we took away some of the cost so in terms of your question on capital we have the capital to manage this so i think it s a business that has not like it s a dramatic shift into a completely new area we had both product lines or both types of product lines and it s about shifting our growth focus on those areas where there s better profit performance and those things that i ll call them more commoditized businesses that are lower technologies cement and sand in a bag for things like mortars pulling those things the volumes down on those where we don t have the value add that we have in the rest of our product line but we have the capacity we need and in fact part of this whole thing drives a better more efficient supply chain because we were moving products inefficiently around the country so part of this was an efficient process to move relatively low margin products around the country so does that give you the background you need dmitry dmitry silversteyn buckingham research analyst it does jim and if i could follow up really quick you made recent announcements of getting into the japanese market as h b fuller rather than through a joint venture that you already have there can you spend a little time pointing to us how that s going to work and why the decision to get into japan directly was made at this time and what how do we think about that business going forward jim owens president and chief executive officer yes i think that s a technical issue dmitry our business is through a joint venture with sekisui fuller it s a great joint venture it gets reported as such in our p l below the line and that s the primary driver of our businesses there s some technicalities in the contract that said that we had to have certain people employed locally so it s a technicality and not at all a change in our strategy we love the joint venture and it s very successful dmitry silversteyn buckingham research analyst ok so this is not a competing business that you jim owens president and chief executive officer no not at all not at all it allows us to do some things in a couple of areas specifically in engineering adhesives that we weren t able to do directly through the joint venture but it just helps us accelerate our engineering adhesives growth strategy dmitry silversteyn buckingham research analyst ok fair enough jim thank you jim owens president and chief executive officer thanks sure thanks for the question operator and our next question comes from mike harrison with seaport global securities please go ahead mike harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good morning i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about specifically about the engineered engineering adhesives business it seems like that sales growth may be decelerated a little bit maybe talk about which specific regions or markets were holding up and which of those deteriorated it sounded like it was auto which is not surprising but maybe give us a sense of what gives you confidence that we re going to return to better volume growth rates in the rest of the year jim owens president and chief executive officer yeah so a couple of comments there mike we first off the growth we re seeing is in electronics in aerospace in some of our general industries opportunities particularly in the u s where we re seeing really good growth as we leverage technology from royal and from tonsan into north america you re right the auto business was weaker and particularly in china and particularly in december so we see that not as bad going forward we re not overly optimistic on the auto business but what we do see is a lot of the wins keep rolling in specifically in electronics some of our microelectronics efforts now are starting to take hold we re winning some business now in korea that s helping that business we re able to expand our solar business which is really a solar assembly business so some of the accessories and some of the insulations around solar so a lot of those good wins are still going through that business as you know our model there is to leverage our technology and really solve problems faster than everybody else and that piece of the model continues to churn out wins i d also point out q4 last of last year was very strong for that business q1 of last year was very strong for that business so the fact that we went down to the single digit we re very confident that that business will be back up to double digits soon despite the fact that auto is probably going to be either flat to a headwind this year mike harrison seaport global securities analyst got it and then i was also hoping that you could talk a little bit about the sg a number if we do the math right it looks like on an absolute basis your sg a costs were down in terms of absolute dollars but up in terms of percent of sales i guess we re a little surprised by that given some of the efforts around royal synergies but does that reflect just a normal inflation or growth investments wondering when we might expect to see some better sg a leverage jim owens president and chief executive officer yes so let me start by saying that a lot of the royal synergies weren t on the sg a side so there s some they re mostly in operations costs and in raw material and in direct savings costs and then the other thing i d say is that there s a fair amount of lumpiness in any one quarter in our sg a cost as a percentage of sales so i d be i think we look at this over the course of the year rather than as a percentage of sales each quarter but let me turn it to john to maybe be more precise about what happened in the quarter to give more color on that john corkrean baird analyst yeah no those are all the right points i think the only thing i would add is that if you look at our cost structure relative to our revenue structure we have more cost in dollars right so we have a larger u s based headquarters that has an impact in terms of looking at it as a percentage of sales we believe we re getting the leverage and the synergies out of sg a that we planned but we do have a little bit of a currency impact jim owens president and chief executive officer just as a color there mike on currency the euro it happened last year but the euro today is 10 weaker than it was a year ago today so it s a big number operator and our next question comes from david begleiter with deutsche bank please go ahead with your question david huang deutsche bank analyst this is david huang here for david i guess first given your comment on cold and wet weather in q1 impacting construction volumes i was wondering if you can quantify roughly what percentage would be shifted to q2 from q1 and if this would again be offset by some lingering impact in march jim owens president and chief executive officer yes so it s tough for us to really know when you have these kind of weather effects on roofing i can tell you i pulled off in our parking lot today and it warmed my heart to see a bunch of roofers climbing up on our roof to do some repairs that were up there and i can tell you the business is very strong here in march but how much of that is going to come into q2 versus q1 is something that we re not able to predict but it should be positive so david huang deutsche bank analyst ok and secondly do you need to take additional cost actions to achieve say your mid to high end of your ebitda guidance for the year jim owens president and chief executive officer yes i would say that if you look to the mid to the high end that s i think a combination of revenues organic revenues stabilizing to where we expect them and then the benefits of raw materials right so the raw material benefits only flow through our p l in a modest way we ll see more benefits in q2 currently we re projecting for raws to flatten out or maybe get a little worse in the second half of the year so i think for us to be on the upside of our plan we d probably expect to see a little better organic growth and certainly the raw material benefits coming through so that s the way we look at the upside of the plan and i think we went into the year with that as the expectation and we re still there that s what drives the top end david huang deutsche bank analyst ok thanks operator and our next question comes from eric petrie with citi please go ahead eric petrie citi analyst good morning jim jim owens president and chief executive officer good morning eric petrie citi analyst noticed signs of stabilization in china and positive growth in the region do you think that s sustainable if there s no trade resolution or how do you see that playing out into the rest of the year jim owens president and chief executive officer yes well i hate to be the prognosticator of china but i would say it is a fact that we grew in our regional business in china so i thought that was a good sign i think as i had said last quarter there was definitely two things going on a slowdown in china and a destocking i think the destocking has stopped because things stopped so i would say certainly if the trade war and there s a great grand deal i think it s going to really help china a lot and will help our business a lot if there s not i think a slow low growth is where we re at today and what i d expect and what we re building our plans on and but not that negative downturn that we saw in q3 and q4 so john do you want to add anything to that or john corkrean baird analyst no i think that s exactly right i think maybe we saw a little more improvement in sort of the consumer led parts of the business as opposed to those that are more impacted by exports jim owens president and chief executive officer yes that s a great point so things like hygiene and packaging did better than some of the export eric petrie citi analyst helpful and then could you give a little color as to why organic growth in eimea is doing better than americas jim owens president and chief executive officer yes but let me give the high level and then maybe john can i think our eimea business has a higher percentage of business outside of core europe so middle east india africa are the fundamental growth drivers for our business it s not core europe but john do you want to add john corkrean baird analyst i think that was the point i was going to make i think we ve always kind of said that as we look at the growth in eimea versus americas we ve always sort of looked at a roughly 1 higher growth target in eimea based on the higher growth in emerging markets eric petrie citi analyst thank you operator and our next question comes from rosemarie morbelli with g research please go ahead rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you good morning everyone jim you mentioned that there are certain areas which are showing signs of pickup so you have mentioned roofing but that is weather related and i was wondering if fundamentally speaking you could talk about some of those areas and what you see going forward jim owens president and chief executive officer yes i m not sure i said that we saw great signs of growth out there i think we ve seen stability in china we see really strong growth in southeast asia i think southeast asia has benefited as well as our team doing a really solid job out there as john mentioned the consumer businesses in china have been positive in north america the things that we saw that were negative were recreational vehicles and then construction related production of materials that would be used in homes and then the other place where we see some positive growth as john just mentioned was middle east africa india we see think there picking up a little so rosemarie morbelli g research analyst any particular areas picking up in those particular in the middle east africa india jim owens president and chief executive officer i would say for us africa we made an investment there a couple of years ago we put some teams on the ground so we re doing pretty well in africa and then our india business india got a little bit of a shock as the currency devalued in the middle of last year i think that s stabilizing and india has been a good solid growth engine for us definitely after last year that slowed down we see that picking up but those would be the two particular ones rosemarie morbelli g research analyst so then looking at your debt reduction that 200 million target for this year is that a level that you are anticipating going forward and then in case of a recession what would be a comfortable net leverage level i mean if you do pay down another 200 million this year you will be at about 1 9 billion of net debt and a 4 0 net leverage which seems high in a recession in particular so can you tell us talk about what you are planning in doing in order to offset what may be coming jim owens president and chief executive officer yeah so why don t i give you the high level and then maybe john can give you some more depth so our commitment was to pay down 600 million over the first three years after the royal deal last year we exceeded that number by 30 million this year despite issues this year we ve got some organic growth issues we re well committed to do 200 million or better and then next year our original plan was to do 230 so i think we have a very clear three year plan on this debt paydown with a goal to get below 3 0 as quickly as we possibly can and there are a number of levers that we can pull with respect to working capital capital management that if there were a recession that we would look to pull on to make certain that we brought our leverage ratios down but it s a strategic priority for us to do that john do you want to comment further john corkrean baird analyst i think you hit all the key points yes i think getting below three long term is our goal that s where we d be comfortable we do try to model what the implications would be of a recession and typically in the short term there actually neutral to positive if raw materials are coming down and if there s kind of working capital release so we re comfortable we re going to stay on this debt repayment plans sort of regardless of the external environment jim owens president and chief executive officer so we have some models we run and action plans that we put in place if a recession were to take place and as john pointed out this working capital release is really helpful in that kind of environment rosemarie morbelli g research analyst ok thank you operator and our next question comes from curt siegmeyer with keybanc please go ahead curt siegmeyer keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys if i could just ask for a clarification on your organic growth outlook coming into the year you were expecting 3 to 5 obviously 1q was a little lower than you expected so is that are you still thinking 3 to 5 or if you ve maybe tend that down a little bit internally what would be the positive offsets that are allowing you to maintain your ebitda and eps guidance jim owens president and chief executive officer yes maybe i ll comment and i ll let john be more specific but yes i think if you looked at our current internal models today you d see the lower end of that guidance would be where we d be at with margin improvement for all the reasons i talked about that raw materials are more positive than we expect going into the year and then the synergy delivery so those two things would offset something where i think if you did 3 to 5 for the rest of the year that s probably about what we expect and that s what we re seeing going forward but that wouldn t get you to the center of the range it would get you to closer to the lower end of the range john corkrean baird analyst yes i think that s right i think we have a little bit of an easier comparison probably in q4 with china sort of declining pretty precipitously and we re not predicting china to recover significantly but if we kind of continue on our current trend that will be a little bit of a positive comparison jim owens president and chief executive officer so lower end of 3 to 5 but very confident in the midrange on the ebitda and the eps is the answer curt siegmeyer keybanc capital markets analyst ok great and then just a follow up your guidance now includes 20 million of pre tax royal integration expenses which i think is up from a 15 to 20 million range can you just give us a little more color there as to why the adjustment john corkrean baird analyst i think it s kind of timing of projects more than anything with particularly related to some of the operational projects but we re probably incurring a little bit more in the restructuring i don t think it will change sort of our expectation for the full project operator and our next question comes from paretosh misra with berenberg please go ahead paretosh misra berenberg capital markets analyst thank you so just in terms of your q2 guidance what have you assumed in terms of fx and raw material cost jim owens president and chief executive officer i ll let john maybe give you some specifics there john corkrean baird analyst so fx paretosh i think is going to be very similar year on year to q1 if you looked kind of where currencies were last year in q2 versus this year and compare that to q1 and raw materials i think we view them as moderately better than q1 we saw some improvement in q1 in terms of raw material cost a lot of that is probably still hung up in inventory it will come through in q2 so modest improvement in raw material costs in q2 paretosh misra berenberg capital markets analyst and then going back to china it sounds like consumer is doing slightly better than the export driven end markets have you seen any impacts of some of the growth supported policies that the government has announced there earlier this year and late last year are you expecting something maybe things to improve because of that in the second half jim owens president and chief executive officer yes i would say the only one that i think of is well there s two areas that were impacted on some of those initiatives one would be solar continues to be an area that the government is supporting and that helps drive output in the market where we re very strong and we ve done very well with electric vehicles especially electric buses so some of the initiatives that are there have been helpful for us and we see those being positive both of those impacting our engineering adhesives business paretosh misra berenberg capital markets analyst got it and then last one for me on your construction business can you remind me how much is the u s based versus non u s based jim owens president and chief executive officer yes i think today it s about 85 to 90 u s based paretosh misra berenberg capital markets analyst got it thanks jim owens president and chief executive officer ok great well thank you everyone for your time today on today s call we really appreciate the support of h b fuller and we re very optimistic about our overall performance going forward particularly given the results in this first quarter so again thanks for your support operator duration 41 minutes call participants barbara doyle vice president of investor

by ranger many developing nations are in debt and poverty partly due to the policies of imf and the world bank by and large their programs have for the past fifty years resulted in poverty and debt and increased dependency on the richer nations despite the imf and world bank s claim that they will reduce poverty following an ideology known as neoliberalism and spearheaded by these and other institutions known as the washington consensus for being based in washington d c structural adjustment policies saps even though modified in the 21st century have been imposed to ensure debt repayment and economic restructuring but the way it has happened has required poor countries to reduce spending on things like health education and development while debt repayment and other economic policies have been made the priority in effect the imf and world bank have demanded that poor nations lower the standard of living of their people a spiraling race to the bottom the imf and world bank provide financial assistance to countries seeking it but apply a neoliberal economic ideology or agenda as a precondition to receiving the money for example they prescribe cutbacks liberalization of the economy and resource extraction export oriented open markets as part of their structural adjustment the role of the state is minimized privatization is encouraged as well as reduced protection of domestic industries other adjustment policies also include currency devaluation increased interest rates flexibility of the labor market and the elimination of subsidies such as fuel and food subsidies to be attractive to foreign investors various regulations and standards are reduced or removed the impact of these preconditions on poorer countries can be devastating factors such as the following lead to further misery for the developing nations and keep them dependent on developed nations poor countries must export more in order to raise enough money to pay off their debts in a timely manner because there are so many nations being asked or forced into the global market place before they are economically and socially stable and ready and told to concentrate on similar cash crops and commodities as others the situation resembles a large scale price war then the resources from the poorer regions become even cheaper which favors consumers in the west governments then need to increase exports just to keep their currencies stable which may not be sustainable either and earn foreign exchange with which to help pay off debts governments therefore must spend less reduce consumption remove or decrease financial regulations and so on over time then the value of labor decreases capital flows become more volatile a spiraling race to the bottom then begins which generates social unrest these nations are then told to peg their currencies to the dollar but keeping the exchange rate stable is costly due to measures such as increased interest rates investors obviously concerned about their assets and interests can then pull out very easily if things get tough in the worst cases capital flight can lead to economic collapse such as we saw in the asian global financial crises of 1997 98 99 or in mexico brazil and many other places during and after a crisis the mainstream media and free trade economists lay the blame on emerging markets and their governments restrictive or inefficient policies crony capitalism etc which is a cruel irony when imf donors keep the exchange rates in their favor it often means that the poor nations remain poor or get even poorer even the 1997 98 99 global financial crisis can be partly blamed on structural adjustment and early overly aggressive deregulation for emerging economies millions of children end up dying each year what is the imf world bank prescription as economist robin hanhel summarizes the imf has prescribed the same medicine for troubled third world economies monetary austerity tighten up the money supply to increase internal interest rates to whatever heights needed to stabilize the value of the local currency fiscal austerity increase tax collections and reduce government spending dramatically privatization sell off public enterprises to the private sector financial liberalization remove restrictions on the inflow and outflow of international capital as well as restrictions on what foreign businesses and banks are allowed to buy own and operate only when governments sign this structural adjustment agreement does the imf agree to lend enough to prevent default on international loans that are about to come due and otherwise would be unpayable arrange a restructuring of the country s debt among private international lenders that includes a pledge of new loans
this month the federal reserve joined its global peers by turning decisively dovish jerome powell and friends haven t just stopped tightening soon they will begin actively easing by reinvesting the fed s maturing mortgage bonds into treasury securities it s not exactly quantitative easing i ii and iii but it will have some of the same effects why are they doing this one theory which i admit possibly plausible was that powell simply caved to wall street pressure the rate hikes and qt were hitting asset prices and liquidity much to the detriment of bankers and others to whom the fed pays keen attention but that doesn t truly square with his 2018 speeches and actions the fed s march 20 announcement suggests more is happening i think two other factors are driving the fed s thinking one is increasing recognition of the same slowing global growth that made other central banks turn dovish in recent months the other is the fed s realization that its previous course risked inverting the yield curve which was violently turning against its fourth quarter expectations and possibly toward recession see chart below courtesy of wsj s daily shot that would not have looked good in the history books hence the backtracking on the second point too late the yield curve inverted and recession forecasts became suddenly de rigueur among the same financial punditry that was wildly bullish just weeks ago my own position has been consistent recession is approaching but not just yet yet like the fed i am data dependent and the latest data are not encouraging today we ll examine this and consider what may have changed let s start with a step back the global economy clearly hasn t recovered from the last recession like it did in previous cycles yes the stock market performed well so has real estate we ve seen some economic growth which in a few places you might even call a boom but for the most part it s been pretty mild unemployment is low but wage growth has been sluggish at best rising asset prices fueled by almost a decade of easy monetary policy also contributed to wealth and income inequality which fueled populist and now semi socialist movements around the world this slow recovery began fading in the last few quarters the first cracks appeared overseas leaving the us as an island of stability not coincidentally we also had slightly positive interest rates and thus attracted capital from elsewhere this let our growth continue longer but now signs of weakness are mounting here too recall this follows years of astonishing amazing unprecedented and astronomically huge monetary stimulus by the federal reserve bank of japan european central bank and others in various and sundry ways they opened the spigots and left them running full speed for almost a decade and all it produced was the above mentioned weak recovery chart below from my friend jim bianco again via the daily shot that alone should tell you that putting your faith in central bankers is probably a mistake we can t know how much worse the last decade would have been without their help but does this feel like success yet here we are with millions still in the hole from the last recession and another one possibly looming we also can t rely on historical precedent to identify where when or why it will start but we can make some educated guesses earlier i called the us an island of stability other such islands exist too and australia is high on the list the last down under recession was 27 yes 27 years ago in 1991 no other developed economy can say the same the long streak has a lot to do with being one of china s top raw material suppliers during that country s historic boom but australia has done other things right too alas all good things come to an end while not officially in recession yet australia s growth is slowing university of new south wales professor richard holden says it is in effective recession with per capita gdp having declined in both q3 and q4 of 2018 by the way italy is similarly in a technical recession expect more such euphemisms as governments try to avoid uttering the r word as often happens real estate is involved australia s housing boom bubble could unravel badly last week grant williams highlighted a video by economist john adams digital finance analytics founder martin north and irish financial adviser eddie hobbs who say australia s economy looks increasingly like ireland s just before the 2007 housing collapse the parallels are a bit spooky australia s household debt to gdp was 120 5 per cent as of september last year according to the bank for international settlements one of the highest in the world in 2007 ireland was sitting at around 100 per cent at the same time the rba puts australia s household debt to disposable income at 188 6 per cent ireland was 200 per cent in 2007 while the us was only 116 3 per cent at the start of 2008 rba figures also show more than two thirds of the country s net household wealth is invested in real estate in 2008 that figure was 83 per cent in ireland and 48 per cent in the us meanwhile 60 per cent of all lending by australian financial institutions is in the property sector in 2007 the international monetary fund gave the irish economy and banking system a clean bill of health and suggested that a soft landing was the most likely outcome last month the imf said australia s property market was heading for a soft landing house prices in sydney and melbourne have fallen nearly 14 per cent and 10 per cent from their respective peaks in july and november 2017 coinciding with sharp drop off in credit flowing into the housing sector both for owner occupiers and investors real estate is by nature credit driven few people pay cash for land homes or commercial properties so when credit dries up so does demand for those assets falling demand means lower prices which is bad when you are highly leveraged it gets worse from there as the banking system gets dragged into the fray losses can quickly spread as defaults affect lenders far from the source like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name

and one company reveals the impact shipping and transport stocks are kind of a canary in the coal mine because they are among the first to signal slowing growth last week fedex reported its international shipping revenue was down and cut its full year earnings guidance its cfo blamed the economy reported cnbc slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue as seen in the year over year decline in our fedex express international revenue alan b graf jr fedex corp executive vice president and chief financial officer said in statement despite a strong u s economy fedex said its international business weakened during the second quarter especially in europe fedex express international was down due primarily to higher growth in lower yielding services and lower weights per shipment graf said to compensate for lower revenue graf said fedex began a voluntary employee buyout program and constrained hiring it is also limiting discretionary spending and is reviewing additional actions fedex shares have dropped roughly 27 percent in the past year lagging the xli industrial etf s 1 percent decline this little snippet overflows with implications let s unpack some of them revenue fell due to higher growth in lower yielding services so those who ship international packages have decided lower costs outweigh speed likewise lower weights per shipment signals they are shipping only what they must when they must fedex is responding with an employee buyout program and constrained hiring the company is overstaffed for its present requirements this might also reflect increased automation of work once done by humans in any case it won t help the employment stats in addition fedex is limiting discretionary spending i m not sure what that means every business always limits discretionary spending or it doesn t stay in business long if fedex is taking additional steps then whoever would have received that spending will also see lower revenues they might have to constrain hiring too obviously fedex is just one company although a large and critically positioned one but statements like this add up to recession if they grow more common and they are one reason fedex is in the vanguard is that it s uniquely exposed to world trade the growth of which is diminishing for multiple reasons part of it is technology the things we ship internationally are increasingly digital and they travel via wires and satellite links instead of ships and planes these sorts of goods aren t easily valued for inclusion in the trade stats energy is another factor between us shale production and renewable energy sources we don t import as much oil and gas from across the seas as we otherwise would that shows up in both trade and currency values the us dollar is stronger now in part because we send fewer dollars to opec note the massive and stealthy growth in lng liquified natural gas exports in the past few years think what this will look like in a few years with not one but four lng export terminals on the us coasts natural gas is also the basis for much of the chemical and fertilizer industry abundant us supplies and prices less than half the cost of russian gas in germany help many us industries compete those are just signs of normal progress and change the economy can adapt to them the greater threat is artificially constrained international trade which is what the trump administration s trade war is creating last year i explained how trade wars can spark recession and trade deficits are nothing to fear i won t repeat all that here but we have since seen several market swoons rallies as harsher trade restrictions looked more less likely whether you like it or not asset values depend on the relatively free flow of goods and services across international borders interfere with that and all kinds of assets become less valuable starting a trade war at the same time growth is slowing for other reasons is more than a little unwise agricultural tariffs have already ripped through us farm country to devastating effect leaving losses some farmers may never recover the president s tariff threats had other impact as well companies raced to import foreign supplied components and inventory before the tariffs took effect this jammed ports and highways last year not with new demand but future demand shifted forward in time this is important and i think we will see the impact soon if we are not already transport and logistics companies geared up for last year s surge expanding their facilities and hiring new workers importers built up inventory in an effort to avoid tariffs that were supposed to take effect in january the deadline was extended but the threat is still alive like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha at some point all this has to stop carrying inventory is expensive and will eventually outweigh the benefit of avoiding tariffs then the boom will come to a screeching halt imports will fall as companies work down inventory all those jobs and construction projects will disappear that combined with the other cyclical factors and high debt loads everywhere could easily add up to a recession exactly when is hard to say recessions usually get pronounced in hindsight so there s some possibility we are in one right now but i still think we ll avoid it this year getting into this box took a long time and so will getting out of it regardless we ll have a recession at some point i think the next subprime crisis will be in corporate debt next week we ll look deeper into the timing question what the yield curve tells us and why the next decade will bring little or no economic growth i realize this is not a happy conclusion but i call them as i see them i ll leave you with one final but critically important thought prepare don t despair tough times are coming but we can handle them you have a chance to get ready i highly suggest you take it time flies monday is already april fool s day and the strategic investment conference is only a month and a half away i m really looking forward to this year s sic the lineup of speakers is truly phenomenal some of them confirmed they were coming at the last minute like my old friend kyle bass who enriches and energizes every conference he speaks at i can t wait to hear what he ll talk about on our china panel the sic is completely sold out at this point but you can still attend virtually like last year we re offering our virtual pass at a steep pre sic discount thanks to the live stream feature a huge hit with passholders in 2018 when we introduced it you will be able to watch most of the conference live as it happens you ll even be able to ask questions and vote on the best questions for the speakers and panelists to answer it s the next best thing to actually being there and after the sic is over you will receive video and audio recordings slide shows and transcripts to enjoy at your leisure on your smartphone tablet or computer again and again you ll find all the details on this page i hope you ll decide to join us at the sic via your virtual pass andy marshall who for the last 50 years has often been called the most important strategic thinker you ve never heard of quietly passed away last tuesday at age 97 starting at the rand think tank in 1949 he was persuaded to move from california by henry kissinger who wanted his intellect at the white house national security council in 1973 secretary of defense james schlesinger with whom he worked at rand brought him over to the defense department to set up the enigmatically titled office of net assessment it was basically a think tank designed to analyze long term threats and problems and help shape military strategy to deal with them he was reappointed by every president and defense secretary until his retirement in 2014 at the age of 94 in the 1970s andy famously contradicted the cia and the foreign policy establishment about the strength of russia s economy and predicted its collapse in the 1990s he quietly circulated his first memo saying china should become the main strategic focus of the us military like his russia analysis it was ignored at first called yoda within the military establishment andy s influence was enormous i first met him over 10 years ago as he hosted small gatherings of economists and strategists to talk about their views of the future i would find myself sitting at the table with names you would easily recognize but for some reason he kept asking me back he invited me to two of his famous week long sessions at the naval war college where he would mix an eclectic group of thinkers with high ranking military professionals to consider alternative futures he asked questions and then put us in a room for 12 hours a day plus long dinners afterward to discuss the opportunities and problems the scenarios might entail it was personally exhilarating and foundational for me at his retirement party a former vice president multiple defense secretaries abundant military brass and strategists gathered to honor this singular man s 40 years of continuous government service he spent 65 years focused on keeping our military prepared for the future i don t have enough room to properly pay tribute to one of the great futurists of our times andy brought the model of competitive thinking that he learned at the university of chicago to military strategy he basically invented the arena of inferential analysis you can read much better reviews of andy s career here by his biographer how is yoda and at the new york times and washington post his life was chronicled in his biography the last warrior andrew marshall and the shaping of modern american defense strategy like what you re reading get this free

apartment near the pentagon crammed full of books and journals to meet with other analysts andy was still mentally vigorous and primarily focused on china there in his room the net assessment of the potential problems with china were not sanguine i once asked andy why he kept inviting me back to his meetings and forums i truly had no idea every time i was in a room with him and the others he

financials and then finally we will wrap up the call with some closing comments and then take your questions we are off to a solid start for 2019 first quarter ebitda and eps results were in line with our expectations and our guidance despite organic revenue growth below our expectation our first quarter results demonstrated the resilience of our business model and the clear strategic positioning of h b fuller in key market segments strong pricing carryover from 2018 cost synergies and effective expense controls all helped to deliver solid performance we entered the year expecting organic revenue growth to be lower in q1 for a few reasons last year s q1 growth was unusually high 11 on a pro forma basis december the first month of our q1 was generally slow as was reported by many companies the strengthening dollar which impacted the year over year results in q1 and the planned repositioning of our construction adhesive portfolio and the slowdown in china in addition to these expected impacts our revenue was lower than forecasted primarily because of softness in our roofing business and durable assembly solutions for the housing market in the u s due to a colder winter with increased rain and snow however the overall benefit of royal synergies our pricing actions from last year and wins in key customers and targeted markets overcame the shortfalls and improved our profit performance and our organic revenues improving going forward many of the elements impacting q1 will not be a factor in q2 and the rest of the year this is all in line with the 2019 imperatives we identified at the beginning of the year in three key areas first we will deliver higher levels of ebitda margin improvement continues to be an operational focus for us in 2019 as we look to build upon the ebitda growth we achieved in 2018 you will hear this theme repeated across each of our segment we met this objective in q1 as adjusted ebitda of 83 million increased on a constant currency basis and adjusted ebitda margins of 12 increased by 40 basis points versus the first quarter of 2018 we expect ebitda trends to continue to increase during the course of the year with solid improvement in total for 2019 our second imperative is to continue to progress as planned with the integration of the royal acquisition we captured an additional three million of synergies in this quarter and we remain on track to deliver 15 million of total incremental cost synergies in 2019 our third imperative is to deliver our debt repayment commitments our debt paydown of 12 million in q1 was greater than q1 of last year just like in 2018 our cash flow from operations and the rate of our debt repayment will accelerate throughout the year based on the seasonal profile of our business thus far we have paid down 216 million in debt since the beginning of 2018 and our 200 million repayment plan in 2019 will put us ahead of our original two year plan for debt reduction now i ll cover the first quarter segment performance on slide 4 in the americas revenues were up modestly in constant currency primarily on pricing gains from 2018 and strong packaging sales these gains offset soft demand in some durable assembly areas such as doors and windows and a slowdown in demand for rvs in the u s adjusted ebitda margin of 12 improved 30 basis points year over year driven by positive pricing and lower sg a expenses eimea sales increased about 1 in constant currency with flattish overall sales in core europe and mid single digit growth in emerging markets positive pricing contribution and strong volumes from our new generation energy efficient insulating glass solution were offset by a general market slowdown in core europe in durable assembly and packaging and polymer the weaker euro british pound and turkish lira compared with the first quarter of 2018 substantially impacted reported revenue currency also negatively impacted ebitda as the weaker currencies combined with some dollar based operating costs offset underlying margin improvement asia pacific organic sales were flat strong growth in southeast asia hygiene and packaging offsets lower sales in other geographies including lower demand for durable assembly products for woodworking and textiles reflecting a softer export market we saw some stabilization in china with positive growth in the quarter although sales still lagged historical levels ebitda performance in asia pacific was very strong with a 25 year over year increase in ebitda dollars and a 250 basis point increase in ebitda margins driven by our continuous pricing portfolio and margin focus construction adhesives organic sales were off by 15 versus q1 of 2018 as we reported in the middle of last year we are moving away from underperforming products and customers in order to maximize profit performance and we forecasted a revenue decline in the quarter as a result this planned portfolio repositioning accounted for a little more than half of the decline the remainder was related to more severe weather in q1 than anticipated impacting this segment and roofing adhesives in particular low sales volume also impacted ebitda the roofing impact was pretty significant especially in late january and february for context the single ply roofing institute an independent data source reported february shipments of epdm rubber roofing membrane was down 25 compared to february of 2018 weather impacts are temporal of course and are part of what drives a significant seasonality that we manage in our fiscal first quarter every year for h b fuller our fiscal first quarter includes christmas chinese new year and weather related slowdowns in december january and february both sales and contribution margin in construction adhesives have begun to improve going into q2 lastly performance in engineering adhesives was strong ebitda dollars were up 21 and ebitda margin was up by 330 basis points to 19 driven by strong growth in the higher margin parts of our business organic revenues increased by mid single digits excluding a 4 currency impact we continue to win new applications with customers across many end markets in q1 strong growth in electronics new energy and aerospace offset lower results in automotive we forecast continued strong performance in engineering adhesives including higher organic growth in the second quarter and low double digit organic growth for the full year along with strong ebitda performance overall our bottom line performance in q1 was in line with our expectations and our guidance even as we absorbed some large unplanned weather related impacts and interruptions we are seeing improved results in the second quarter and we continue to forecast strong results in the second half of the year now let me turn the call over to john to discuss our financials and our guidance in more detail john corkrean baird analyst thanks jim i ll begin on slide 5 with some additional financial details on the first quarter net revenue was down 5 6 versus the same period last year driven by a significantly stronger dollar which negatively impacted net revenues by nearly 5 adjusting for currency organic revenue was down 1 as solid pricing carryover was offset by softness in construction related markets over the winter months and repositioning away from underperforming products and customers in the construction adhesive segment year on year adjusted gross profit margin increased 90 basis points reflecting strong pricing actions taken last year acquisition synergies and manufacturing efficiency gains adjusted selling general and administrative expense was down about 2 5 versus last year reflecting the impact of foreign currency exchange and thoughtful control of the discretionary expenses adjusted ebitda for the quarter of 83 million was in line with our expectations and guidance ebitda margin increased 40 basis points versus the same period in 2018 reflecting strong pricing carryover improved business mix manufacturing efficiency gains and expense control offsetting weaker volume in construction related markets adjusted earnings per share were 0 34 compared to 0 35 for the same period last year as improved margins good expense control and lower interest expense associated with our debt reduction actions offset significant currency headwinds versus last year with that let me now turn to our guidance for the 2019 fiscal year we continue to expect adjusted ebitda of between 465 and 485 million for the full year 2019 this represents an increase of 6 versus 2018 adjusted ebitda at the midpoint ebitda will continue to improve on the remaining three quarters based on the seasonality of our business improving volumes and moderating foreign currency exchange impact and we expect approximately 120 million to 125 million of adjusted ebitda in the second quarter we also continue to expect full year adjusted eps of between 3 15 and 3 45 this range represents growth of 10 versus the 2018 fiscal year at the midpoint of the range with that i will now turn the call back to jim owens for some closing comments jim owens president and chief executive officer thank you john our strategic plan to win business in highly engineered applications and to improve margins through effective pricing synergies and raw material costs all were executed well in q1 and continue to show positive momentum in the quarter we leveraged acquisition related synergies and the strong pricing actions that we took in 2018 along with continued customer wins in engineering adhesives and other key markets to deliver earning results and debt paydown in line with our guidance based on improving trends in several segments throughout the quarter we expect stronger organic growth in the second quarter and continued ebitda improvement throughout the year we re on track to deliver eps ebitda and debt paydown within our guidance ranges for fiscal 2019 our first quarter results show the resiliency in our business model as we build on our strategic position as a global leader in adhesives we are winning customer business and gaining share in our targeted growth markets we can t control the macro factors that occur external to our global business however we can and we are gaining share and margins through our business model of solving customers toughest adhesion problems that concludes our prepared comments for today so operator let s open up the call for some questions questions and answers operator and our first question today comes from ghansham panjabi with baird please go ahead ghansham panjabi executive vice president and chief financial officer hey guys good morning thanks for taking my questions i guess first off in the past you ve given us a volume breakdown by segment i was hoping you could do the same for the first quarter as well just trying to reconcile that 4 decline and how that kind of flowed through by segment and then also the same with price mix if you could jim owens president and chief executive officer yeah so i ll comment and maybe john can add we talked a little bit about this during our investor day the volume mix breakdown is something especially by segment on a quarter by quarter basis that really hasn t been providing enough meaningful information and the reason for that ghansham is because for any customer that we have we can change the product the price the packaging as well as the amount of adhesive that that customer uses so we look specifically at organic revenue as the big driver of our business this has gotten even more important as we ve integrated royal we sell adhesives in 30 ccs up to 10 trucks so this volume metrics i think were creating a lot of noise on a quarter by quarter basis that weren t really driving and that s why we ve stopped doing it on a segment basis by quarter but we still report it for the overall business as well so john do you want to add something to that john corkrean baird analyst yeah i mean i think we try to give a little color in the script too but just maybe to reemphasize it i d say in the regional adhesives markets it s very similar picture to q4 with pricing really driving the net impact there with a little attrition in volume similar to what we saw in q4 engineering adhesives is volume driven right and that s been the case and construction is really a volume story as well so hopefully that gives you some color ghansham panjabi executive vice president and chief financial officer that s helpful and then just from a high level basis obviously i mean volumes did step down meaningfully in the first quarter versus the previous quarterly run rate probably lower than you thought during initial when you constructed the guidance for 19 i guess what are the offsets that give you confidence in your reiterated guidance is it lower raw material cost is it something that you re seeing from a synergy standpoint or commercialization etc what are the offsets that give you confidence on the guidance jim owens president and chief executive officer yes thanks ghansham yes as we pointed out some of the things that happened in q1 are going away in q2 right so from an organic revenue standpoint but more importantly i think even in that kind of environment where we had weaker organic revenues the benefits of raw materials and the benefits of royal synergies are flowing through our p l so i think the combination of an improving trend if you look at the quarter december was a problem for us as it was for other people it continued to improve and we see that continuing to improve here into march so the top line has definitely improved as the quarter went on the roofing impacts which were sizable for our business go away but i think most importantly why we have a lot of optimism is because of what s underlying in our business stronger margin performance due to raw materials and the synergies taking effect as we go forward ghansham panjabi executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim thanks john operator and our next question comes from dmitry silversteyn with buckingham research please go ahead with your question dmitry silversteyn buckingham research analyst good morning thank you for taking my question a couple of things that i kind of wanted to get into the construction products transformation that you guys are undergoing so you talked about a little bit over half of the decline being caused by you walking away from some business or however you want to term it i guess what i m trying to understand is how long is this pruning going to last as far as it being overwhelmed if you will or overwhelming the growth in your other businesses and resulting in slower behavior for the division overall and also as you are executing this transformation are you running into any kind of equipment or capacity issues where i m assuming you re making smaller batches of higher volume or higher margin products and that s part of your transformation is your equipment and your plant setup and processes are they aligning with that type of a transformation or is there work that needs to be done there on the capex side jim owens president and chief executive officer ok great yes thanks for that question dmitry it s a good one for us to spend a little time explaining i think a good thing to do is look at our q4 in terms of what happened in our results so we had a decline in revenue but an improvement in ebitda and i think if we hadn t had this roofing effect you d see that same kind of effect this quarter you would have actually seen ebitda up on lower revenue and so it was really about defining those pieces of our business there s business we were supplying that was very high volume bulk business that was ultimately negative profit once we took away some of the cost so in terms of your question on capital we have the capital to manage this so i think it s a business that has not like it s a dramatic shift into a completely new area we had both product lines or both types of product lines and it s about shifting our growth focus on those areas where there s better profit performance and those things that i ll call them more commoditized businesses that are lower technologies cement and sand in a bag for things like mortars pulling those things the volumes down on those where we don t have the value add that we have in the rest of our product line but we have the capacity we need and in fact part of this whole thing drives a better more efficient supply chain because we were moving products inefficiently around the country so part of this was an efficient process to move relatively low margin products around the country so does that give you the background you need dmitry dmitry silversteyn buckingham research analyst it does jim and if i could follow up really quick you made recent announcements of getting into the japanese market as h b fuller rather than through a joint venture that you already have there can you spend a little time pointing to us how that s going to work and why the decision to get into japan directly was made at this time and what how do we think about that business going forward jim owens president and chief executive officer yes i think that s a technical issue dmitry our business is through a joint venture with sekisui fuller it s a great joint venture it gets reported as such in our p l below the line and that s the primary driver of our businesses there s some technicalities in the contract that said that we had to have certain people employed locally so it s a technicality and not at all a change in our strategy we love the joint venture and it s very successful dmitry silversteyn buckingham research analyst ok so this is not a competing business that you jim owens president and chief executive officer no not at all not at all it allows us to do some things in a couple of areas specifically in engineering adhesives that we weren t able to do directly through the joint venture but it just helps us accelerate our engineering adhesives growth strategy dmitry silversteyn buckingham research analyst ok fair enough jim thank you jim owens president and chief executive officer thanks sure thanks for the question operator and our next question comes from mike harrison with seaport global securities please go ahead mike harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good morning i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about specifically about the engineered engineering adhesives business it seems like that sales growth may be decelerated a little bit maybe talk about which specific regions or markets were holding up and which of those deteriorated it sounded like it was auto which is not surprising but maybe give us a sense of what gives you confidence that we re going to return to better volume growth rates in the rest of the year jim owens president and chief executive officer yeah so a couple of comments there mike we first off the growth we re seeing is in electronics in aerospace in some of our general industries opportunities particularly in the u s where we re seeing really good growth as we leverage technology from royal and from tonsan into north america you re right the auto business was weaker and particularly in china and particularly in december so we see that not as bad going forward we re not overly optimistic on the auto business but what we do see is a lot of the wins keep rolling in specifically in electronics some of our microelectronics efforts now are starting to take hold we re winning some business now in korea that s helping that business we re able to expand our solar business which is really a solar assembly business so some of the accessories and some of the insulations around solar so a lot of those good wins are still going through that business as you know our model there is to leverage our technology and really solve problems faster than everybody else and that piece of the model continues to churn out wins i d also point out q4 last of last year was very strong for that business q1 of last year was very strong for that business so the fact that we went down to the single digit we re very confident that that business will be back up to double digits soon despite the fact that auto is probably going to be either flat to a headwind this year mike harrison seaport global securities analyst got it and then i was also hoping that you could talk a little bit about the sg a number if we do the math right it looks like on an absolute basis your sg a costs were down in terms of absolute dollars but up in terms of percent of sales i guess we re a little surprised by that given some of the efforts around royal synergies but does that reflect just a normal inflation or growth investments wondering when we might expect to see some better sg a leverage jim owens president and chief executive officer yes so let me start by saying that a lot of the royal synergies weren t on the sg a side so there s some they re mostly in operations costs and in raw material and in direct savings costs and then the other thing i d say is that there s a fair amount of lumpiness in any one quarter in our sg a cost as a percentage of sales so i d be i think we look at this over the course of the year rather than as a percentage of sales each quarter but let me turn it to john to maybe be more precise about what happened in the quarter to give more color on that john corkrean baird analyst yeah no those are all the right points i think the only thing i would add is that if you look at our cost structure relative to our revenue structure we have more cost in dollars right so we have a larger u s based headquarters that has an impact in terms of looking at it as a percentage of sales we believe we re getting the leverage and the synergies out of sg a that we planned but we do have a little bit of a currency impact jim owens president and chief executive officer just as a color there mike on currency the euro it happened last year but the euro today is 10 weaker than it was a year ago today so it s a big number operator and our next question comes from david begleiter with deutsche bank please go ahead with your question david huang deutsche bank analyst this is david huang here for david i guess first given your comment on cold and wet weather in q1 impacting construction volumes i was wondering if you can quantify roughly what percentage would be shifted to q2 from q1 and if this would again be offset by some lingering impact in march jim owens president and chief executive officer yes so it s tough for us to really know when you have these kind of weather effects on roofing i can tell you i pulled off in our parking lot today and it warmed my heart to see a bunch of roofers climbing up on our roof to do some repairs that were up there and i can tell you the business is very strong here in march but how much of that is going to come into q2 versus q1 is something that we re not able to predict but it should be positive so david huang deutsche bank analyst ok and secondly do you need to take additional cost actions to achieve say your mid to high end of your ebitda guidance for the year jim owens president and chief executive officer yes i would say that if you look to the mid to the high end that s i think a combination of revenues organic revenues stabilizing to where we expect them and then the benefits of raw materials right so the raw material benefits only flow through our p l in a modest way we ll see more benefits in q2 currently we re projecting for raws to flatten out or maybe get a little worse in the second half of the year so i think for us to be on the upside of our plan we d probably expect to see a little better organic growth and certainly the raw material benefits coming through so that s the way we look at the upside of the plan and i think we went into the year with that as the expectation and we re still there that s what drives the top end david huang deutsche bank analyst ok thanks operator and our next question comes from eric petrie with citi please go ahead eric petrie citi analyst good morning jim jim owens president and chief executive officer good morning eric petrie citi analyst noticed signs of stabilization in china and positive growth in the region do you think that s sustainable if there s no trade resolution or how do you see that playing out into the rest of the year jim owens president and chief executive officer yes well i hate to be the prognosticator of china but i would say it is a fact that we grew in our regional business in china so i thought that was a good sign i think as i had said last quarter there was definitely two things going on a slowdown in china and a destocking i think the destocking has stopped because things stopped so i would say certainly if the trade war and there s a great grand deal i think it s going to really help china a lot and will help our business a lot if there s not i think a slow low growth is where we re at today and what i d expect and what we re building our plans on and but not that negative downturn that we saw in q3 and q4 so john do you want to add anything to that or john corkrean baird analyst no i think that s exactly right i think maybe we saw a little more improvement in sort of the consumer led parts of the business as opposed to those that are more impacted by exports jim owens president and chief executive officer yes that s a great point so things like hygiene and packaging did better than some of the export eric petrie citi analyst helpful and then could you give a little color as to why organic growth in eimea is doing better than americas jim owens president and chief executive officer yes but let me give the high level and then maybe john can i think our eimea business has a higher percentage of business outside of core europe so middle east india africa are the fundamental growth drivers for our business it s not core europe but john do you want to add john corkrean baird analyst i think that was the point i was going to make i think we ve always kind of said that as we look at the growth in eimea versus americas we ve always sort of looked at a roughly 1 higher growth target in eimea based on the higher growth in emerging markets eric petrie citi analyst thank you operator and our next question comes from rosemarie morbelli with g research please go ahead rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you good morning everyone jim you mentioned that there are certain areas which are showing signs of pickup so you have mentioned roofing but that is weather related and i was wondering if fundamentally speaking you could talk about some of those areas and what you see going forward jim owens president and chief executive officer yes i m not sure i said that we saw great signs of growth out there i think we ve seen stability in china we see really strong growth in southeast asia i think southeast asia has benefited as well as our team doing a really solid job out there as john mentioned the consumer businesses in china have been positive in north america the things that we saw that were negative were recreational vehicles and then construction related production of materials that would be used in homes and then the other place where we see some positive growth as john just mentioned was middle east africa india we see think there picking up a little so rosemarie morbelli g research analyst any particular areas picking up in those particular in the middle east africa india jim owens president and chief executive officer i would say for us africa we made an investment there a couple of years ago we put some teams on the ground so we re doing pretty well in africa and then our india business india got a little bit of a shock as the currency devalued in the middle of last year i think that s stabilizing and india has been a good solid growth engine for us definitely after last year that slowed down we see that picking up but those would be the two particular ones rosemarie morbelli g research analyst so then looking at your debt reduction that 200 million target for this year is that a level that you are anticipating going forward and then in case of a recession what would be a comfortable net leverage level i mean if you do pay down another 200 million this year you will be at about 1 9 billion of net debt and a 4 0 net leverage which seems high in a recession in particular so can you tell us talk about what you are planning in doing in order to offset what may be coming jim owens president and chief executive officer yeah so why don t i give you the high level and then maybe john can give you some more depth so our commitment was to pay down 600 million over the first three years after the royal deal last year we exceeded that number by 30 million this year despite issues this year we ve got some organic growth issues we re well committed to do 200 million or better and then next year our original plan was to do 230 so i think we have a very clear three year plan on this debt paydown with a goal to get below 3 0 as quickly as we possibly can and there are a number of levers that we can pull with respect to working capital capital management that if there were a recession that we would look to pull on to make certain that we brought our leverage ratios down but it s a strategic priority for us to do that john do you want to comment further john corkrean baird analyst i think you hit all the key points yes i think getting below three long term is our goal that s where we d be comfortable we do try to model what the implications would be of a recession and typically in the short term there actually neutral to positive if raw materials are coming down and if there s kind of working capital release so we re comfortable we re going to stay on this debt repayment plans sort of regardless of the external environment jim owens president and chief executive officer so we have some models we run and action plans that we put in place if a recession were to take place and as john pointed out this working capital release is really helpful in that kind of environment rosemarie morbelli g research analyst ok thank you operator and our next question comes from curt siegmeyer with keybanc please go ahead curt siegmeyer keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys if i could just ask for a clarification on your organic growth outlook coming into the year you were expecting 3 to 5 obviously 1q was a little lower than you expected so is that are you still thinking 3 to 5 or if you ve maybe tend that down a little bit internally what would be the positive offsets that are allowing you to maintain your ebitda and eps guidance jim owens president and chief executive officer yes maybe i ll comment and i ll let john be more specific but yes i think if you looked at our current internal models today you d see the lower end of that guidance would be where we d be at with margin improvement for all the reasons i talked about that raw materials are more positive than we expect going into the year and then the synergy delivery so those two things would offset something where i think if you did 3 to 5 for the rest of the year that s probably about what we expect and that s what we re seeing going forward but that wouldn t get you to the center of the range it would get you to closer to the lower end of the range john corkrean baird analyst yes i think that s right i think we have a little bit of an easier comparison probably in q4 with china sort of declining pretty precipitously and we re not predicting china to recover significantly but if we kind of continue on our current trend that will be a little bit of a positive comparison jim owens president and chief executive officer so lower end of 3 to 5 but very confident in the midrange on the ebitda and the eps is the answer curt siegmeyer keybanc capital markets analyst ok great and then just a follow up your guidance now includes 20 million of pre tax royal integration expenses which i think is up from a 15 to 20 million range can you just give us a little more color there as to why the adjustment john corkrean baird analyst i think it s kind of timing of projects more than anything with particularly related to some of the operational projects but we re probably incurring a little bit more in the restructuring i don t think it will change sort of our expectation for the full project operator and our next question comes from paretosh misra with berenberg please go ahead paretosh misra berenberg capital markets analyst thank you so just in terms of your q2 guidance what have you assumed in terms of fx and raw material cost jim owens president and chief executive officer i ll let john maybe give you some specifics there john corkrean baird analyst so fx paretosh i think is going to be very similar year on year to q1 if you looked kind of where currencies were last year in q2 versus this year and compare that to q1 and raw materials i think we view them as moderately better than q1 we saw some improvement in q1 in terms of raw material cost a lot of that is probably still hung up in inventory it will come through in q2 so modest improvement in raw material costs in q2 paretosh misra berenberg capital markets analyst and then going back to china it sounds like consumer is doing slightly better than the export driven end markets have you seen any impacts of some of the growth supported policies that the government has announced there earlier this year and late last year are you expecting something maybe things to improve because of that in the second half jim owens president and chief executive officer yes i would say the only one that i think of is well there s two areas that were impacted on some of those initiatives one would be solar continues to be an area that the government is supporting and that helps drive output in the market where we re very strong and we ve done very well with electric vehicles especially electric buses so some of the initiatives that are there have been helpful for us and we see those being positive both of those impacting our engineering adhesives business paretosh misra berenberg capital markets analyst got it and then last one for me on your construction business can you remind me how much is the u s based versus non u s based jim owens president and chief executive officer yes i think today it s about 85 to 90 u s based paretosh misra berenberg capital markets

i worry a lot about how we re going to handle the next recession i m not sure when it s going to come or if the yield curve suggests a downturn is imminent but unless the fed and congress are way more competent than i think they are unemployment will start to tick up and growth will start to slow and turn negative eventually when the 2008 downturn hit the us government used two tools to try to fight it monetary policy as conducted by the fed and fiscal policy as decided on by congress both helped significantly and both nonetheless fell short of what the country needed millions of people went unemployed who needn t have hurting their economic prospects for the rest of their lives and increasing their mortality rates not least due to suicide fed chair ben bernanke bafflingly opted not to cut interest rates to stimulate recovery in september 2008 just as lehman brothers was collapsing the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 or the fiscal stimulus as it s colloquially known appears to have worked but it was too small there are plenty of policies that the fed and congress could adopt right now that will make a future recession less devastating or even prevent one entirely economists and policy analysts have been proposing a bunch ever since the crash hit the basic shared premise behind the ideas is that the system failed last time there s no reason unemployment in the us should ever get near to 10 percent and there s no reason for a recession and recovery to take as long as they did better fiscal monetary and legal policy would have pumped more stimulus into the economy and gotten us back to low unemployment and steady growth earlier and to prevent individual policymakers from screwing it up next time many of these proposals incorporate automatic rules that allow stimulus to kick in as soon as economic trouble comes without waiting for congress to get to work this is hardly an exhaustive list but here are some of the most dramatic and promising recession proofing proposals out there 1 pay out more food stamps when unemployment is high the basic rationale for fiscal stimulus during recessions as conducted in the 2008 pelosi bush stimulus package or the 2009 stimulus that became synonymous with obama s policy on the recovery is that additional government spending can boost growth both because the spending itself represents growth and because it can spur spending in the private sector too that effect is measured by something called the fiscal multiplier which measures the increase in economic activity for every 1 of government spending or tax cuts the multiplier varies widely between different kinds of spending or tax cuts and arguably the most effective kind of spending is the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap or food stamps mark zandi at moody s analytics estimated that 1 in snap spending increased growth by 1 74 in 2009 in the depths of the recession and by 1 22 in 2015 well into the recovery not only did 1 in additional government spending in 2009 add to growth but it spurred 74 cents worth of private sector spending too these are rough estimates it should be said during the obama years i once heard chief economist jason furman joke that everyone cited the zandi numbers because he s the only person whose estimates had two decimal places snap is already what s called an automatic stabilizer because eligibility is determined by income the number of people getting benefits and the size of the average benefit grows during recessions which automatically helps fight recessions but congress could do more as jared bernstein and ben spielberg suggested in a center on budget and policy priorities report congress could fund higher snap benefits when state unemployment rates increase alan blinder at princeton has echoed the idea of making snap benefits temporarily higher and further suggested automatically increasing unemployment insurance payments during recessions which zandi s analysis suggests is nearly as stimulative as food stamps 2 automatically cut payroll tax rates blinder further suggests cutting payroll tax rates automatically when unemployment rises this is a fairly common proposal obama budget chief peter orszag floated it back in 2011 for instance you could achieve this in a bunch of different ways you could as in the 2009 stimulus establish a separate making work pay tax credit to refund payroll taxes paycheck to paycheck or you could as congress chose to do in 2010 just slash the payroll tax rate directly zandi s estimates put the multiplier for payroll tax cuts at 1 27 not as good as unemployment insurance or food stamps but not bad and the payroll tax rate is a very simple clear lever which should be easy to automatically tie to unemployment you could even imagine the payroll tax rate going negative and adding to paychecks if the situation gets truly dire 3 government created jobs when unemployment rises arguably one of the most effective parts of the 2009 stimulus was the tanf emergency fund which gave money for states to offer subsidized jobs to low income people under the temporary assistance to needy families program although the program wasn t rigorously evaluated retrospective analyses suggested that the fund was effective at creating work at low cost 1 3 billion in federal funding led to more than 260 000 new jobs a ratio of about 5 000 per job created the fact that the subsidized jobs programs were set up and implemented quickly was also encouraging suggesting that large scale direct job creation is administratively possible in the modern era the elevate act recently introduced by sen ron wyden d or and rep danny davis d il would set up a similar subsidized job program and tie federal funding for it to state unemployment rates states would have considerable flexibility in what those subsidized jobs look like but would be required to adopt models with strong evidence bases 4 force down electric water heat and cable bills in the new book law and macroeconomics legal remedies to recessions yale economist and law professor yair listokin suggests having utility agencies purposefully hold down rates for gas electricity and other basic costs during recessions normally he notes utilities do the opposite people spend less during recessions which means that utilities normally ask for the ability to raise rates to make up for the money they re losing that takes money out of the pockets of families right when the economy needs them to have more money to spend it s particularly rough for low income families whose utility costs make up a big share of monthly costs by contrast having regulators deny utilities the ability to increase rates or force them to lower rates functions as a tax cut that directly increases the spending ability of poor households that s not just a stimulus package for congress or the fed to enact it s something that even city governments could do 5 promise to forgive mortgages listokin also echoes economists amir sufi and atif mian s observation that more pro consumer mortgage foreclosure law could lead to more debt forgiveness more spending and a faster recovery he argues that judges ruling on construction projects should default to building rather than not building during recessions so as not to hold back demand this is also an area where congress can step in the obama administration s main mortgage relief policy targeted mortgage servicers rather than mortgage holders indeed it declined to help mortgage holders by failing to enact cramdown legislation that would allow bankruptcy judges to lower mortgage payments passing cramdown would be a good way to preemptively enable judges to lower debt and facilitate the next recovery 6 change what the fed is targeting right now the federal reserve says that it s targeting inflation it wants overall prices to increase by 2 percent year over year that means that if the economy takes a nosedive and prices stop increasing or even start falling it has committed to take action like cutting interest rates to make prices rise more if by contrast prices start rising too much maybe because the economy has recovered workers start demanding higher wages those higher wages force employers to raise their prices etc the fed is committed to raising interest rates to hold inflation in check there have been a few problems with this approach for one thing the fed was not able to deliver 2 percent inflation during the recovery from the great recession and kept undershooting that target that failure might have come about because the fed s traditional tool for increasing inflation lowering interest rates wasn t possible it had set interest rates around zero percent since 2008 and so was limited to quantitative easing buying up large amounts of long term bonds to force long term interest rates down and making declarations if it wanted to do more to force up inflation so a number of economists including bentley professor and influential blogger scott sumner former obama chief economist christina romer and monetary policy expert michael woodford called during the recession for the fed to adopt something called ngdp targeting instead of targeting a certain level of inflation the fed would try to make sure nominal gross domestic product ngdp the total amount of spending in the economy increases by the same amount each year if it falls behind that probably means there s a recession and the fed needs to act to get growth higher if it goes too far ahead that probably means inflation is getting out of hand and the fed needs to tighten up compared to an inflation target an ngdp target would make it clear to markets that the fed is serious about trying to boost growth and fight unemployment during recessions it s not just serious about fighting out of control inflation that signal alone according to advocates would reduce the severity of recessions by pledging to do whatever it takes to return nominal gdp to its pre crisis trajectory the fed could improve confidence and expectations of future growth romer wrote in 2011 such expectations could increase spending and growth today consumers who are more certain that they ll have a job next year would be less hesitant to spend and companies that believe sales will be rising would be more likely to invest the fed could decide on its own to adopt an ngdp target right now but congress could also force it to do so just as congress forced it to prioritize both full employment and price stability in britain parliament sets the inflation target that the bank of england is expected to enforce american norms of central bank independence wouldn t allow that kind of thing but it s a totally valid model we could borrow and it would be well within congress s powers to pass a law setting an ngdp target of say 5 percent year over year growth 7 try for higher inflation maybe ngdp targeting is a step too far for the fed it s too different from the inflation targeting it s been doing for years arguably a simpler alternative would be to just change the inflation target from 2 percent to 4 percent the fed can t put its interest rate too far below zero percent if rates hit say 10 percent then people would start taking their money out of banks and storing it in cash form this is known in monetary policy as the zero lower bound but the bound is nominal not inflation adjusted when inflation is 2 percent a fed interest rate of zero is effectively a 2 percent rate in real inflation adjusted terms so laurence ball a professor at johns hopkins has proposed moving to a 4 percent inflation target which would allow a bottom real rate of negative 4 percent that gives the fed a lot more room to operate during downturns 8 have the fed distribute cash directly to people if all goes according to plan an ngdp target or higher inflation target would be self enforcing the fed would announce that this is what they re doing and then markets would adjust in turn that s what optimists like sumner think would happen but let s say the markets don t automatically adjust and demand the fed take more substantive actions to meet its targets and let s say that when the fed starts to fear it ll undershoot its ngdp or inflation target interest rates are already at or near zero percent there are a few things it could do it could buy up treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities like it did during quantitative easing rounds during the last recession it could junk the qe approach of buying a set amount of assets and instead say it s going to just start buying up as much stuff as it can until it reaches its targets it could follow economist roger farmer s advice and buy up normal stocks as the bank of japan has it might make sense though for congress to give it a new tool helicopter drops congress could empower the fed to print money and distribute it to americans directly perhaps through a universal basic income style cash payment to all adults or households or by cutting payroll tax rates and paying for the difference in printed money this would have a clearer distributional impact than quantitative easing as it would direct more resources to poor households and might be more effective in that poor households are likelier to spend additional cash rather than save it 9 abolish cash money the idea of a zero lower bound assumes that central banks can t set negative interest rates but that s not strictly speaking true the european central bank and denmark s national bank for instance have had slightly negative rates since 2014 if you park money with them you have to pay a fraction of a percent interest back to them but there s a reason both the ecb and denmark have stuck to mildly negative rates like negative 0 4 percent the current ecb rate if they went strongly negative then the costs of keeping cash in the banking system compared to taking it out and storing it in a giant locker breaking bad style will become overwhelming and people will just take all their cash out so some economists like harvard s kenneth rogoff have called for abolishing cash money and moving to entirely electronic payments to avoid this problem and allow central banks to make interest rates as negative as they like in its most extreme form this idea could really hurt poor people who are unbanked particularly undocumented immigrants who have to be paid in cash when india tried pulling a few banknotes from circulation in 2016 in a similar maneuver the results were pretty disastrous so miles kimball at the university of colorado has proposed achieving this by retaining paper money but separating its value from that of electronic money paper currency could still continue to exist but prices would be set in terms of electronic dollars or abroad electronic euros or yen with paper dollars potentially being exchanged at a discount compared to electronic dollars he writes it would be a little less convenient for those who insisted on continuing to use currency but even there it would just be a matter of figuring out with a pocket calculator how many extra paper dollars it would take to make up for the fact that each one was worth less than an electronic dollar he adds that s it and we wouldn t have to worry about the fed or any other central bank ever

the us dollar climbed higher as markets balanced out global growth concerns along with optimism a trade deal was nearing between the two largest economies in the world us economic data painted a mixed picture with the earlier data in the week confirming slowdown worries the focus is expected to shift away from the 3 month 10 year yield curve inversion as april data is expected to show signs the economy is stabilizing or possibly rebounding trade optimism is also growing as chinese vice premier liu he will resume talks with us officials in dc on wednesday with accommodative stances firmly cemented by most of the major central banks any improvements to the global outlook could help drive a high beta rebound strike 3 for pm may means long extension oil s best quarter in almost a decade may continue australian rate decision budget and election announcement on tap brexit normally after three strikes you are out but pm may seems determined to ram through a deal so the uk can avoid taking part in eu parliamentary elections in may may suffered a third defeat on her stripped down withdrawal agreement the margin of defeat has steadily improved from a historic 230 votes to 149 and on friday she lost by 58 votes the third defeat raises bets that we will see a general election complicating the uk s attempts to finalizing a divorce agreement with the eu monday s indicative votes may see a customs union be agreed upon in parliament the base case is for uk to get a long extension and on monday we will see lawmakers try to figure out options for a plan b the risks of a no deal exit or an election are growing and those options would likely be the most bearish for the british pound australia the australia dollar volatility should pickup ahead of a busy week that will see a rate decision the annual budget release and announcement of elections expectations are high for the rba to deliver a rate cut this year especially after they witness their own yield curve inversion unlike the us australian 3 month 10 year yield curve inversions are more frequent and recent history shows six out of seven inversions saw rate cuts the release of the australian budget is expected to snap a long streak of deficits economists expect a budget surplus of a 4 6 billion in the year through june 2020 the first since 1970 the last time australia saw a surplus was right before the financial crisis in 2008 later in the week expectations are high for elections to be called something we have been seeing frequently in australia they have seen six prime ministers over the last 9 years and current polls have labor opposition s bill shorten in the lead oil west texas intermediate crude had a great quarter that saw price recapture the 60 00 a barrel level the first time since early november the recent rise stemmed from growing optimism on global growth and continued declines with us rigs april optimism is high for us and china data to recover and that could be a key spark for the demand side argument for higher prices regarding production cuts opec has been very effective in stabilizing prices and if we continue to hear supportive comments from russia prices could remain well supported opec has punted the april extraordinary meeting till after the us makes their decision on sanctions with iran and venezuela if opec fails to deliver a year end extension that could be straw that breaks this bullish rally s back s p 500 has best quarter since 2009 stocks managed to still crush it this quarter despite a yield inversion with the fed s favorite spread and heightened economic growth concerns the rally is mainly attributed to accommodative monetary policy stances globally expectations for growth concerns to stabilize and optimism china and the us will make a trade deal this was a very long earnings season and the next season is about to kickoff on april 11th expectations are for a soft quarter but we could be in for a bullish surprise if we see trade war concerns ease earnings growth for the s p 5000 index are eyed falling 3 3 when compared to the same period from a year ago weakness is heavily priced in and we could see strong reactions if we do get some more optimistic outlooks turkish lira once the turkish controls are relaxed we still could see the lira collapse regardless of the local turkish election outcomes investors may be quick to hit the sell button if turkey abandoning faith in turkish investments the restriction of allowing foreign investors to sell the lira could prove to be damning in the future the turkish economy is very weak falling into its first recession in a decade and with inflation three times above the bank s target range if the elections see the public vote in line with the recent data president erdogan

looking to asian fx in the week ahead a number of factors remain in the picture which could weigh on or support asian currencies leaving investors glued to the newswires global trade issues remain prominent with us china trade talks expected to impact risk appetite moving forward investors will also be receptive to news flow on chinese growth amid growing concerns of a global slowdown nation specific factors will also be apparent in the week ahead with the reserve bank of india s bi monthly monetary policy review expected to yield a further cut to rates as the central bank finds itself under governmental pressure to ease policy with a general trend towards dovishness developing among central bank s policy rate differentials could come into play for the indonesian rupiah idr and philippine peso php us china trade talks progress slowly after a spell on the back burner us china trade negotiations came back to the fore as us trade representatives met with their chinese counterparts in beijing to resume high stakes trade talks sentiment in the area was relatively upbeat after u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin reported that he alongside u s trade representative robert lighthizer had concluded constructive trade talks in beijing however having now missed the march deadline and with key issues still to be resolved market expectations for an imminent resolution to the trade spat which has weighed heavily on markets are limited commenting on the protracted negotiations and the impact on markets ing s asia economist prakash sakpal wrote us and chinese trade negotiators are going back and forth between beijing and washington but doubts about a deal abound speculation that it could take months to reach an agreement suggests the current round of negotiations may not produce any tangible result if that s the case the markets will have little to celebrate in the coming days while the lack of a resolution means continued uncertainty about global trade sakpal noted that with neither side apparently in a rush to bridge their trade differences a continued truce seems to be the best course for markets for now asian growth tipped to remain subdued eyes on chinese pmis amid concerns of a global slowdown and the on hiatus us china trade dispute expectations for asian growth have been restricted of late with evidence that a number of asian nations particularly china have borne the brunt of lower demand and higher uncertainty in this regards next week s manufacturing and non manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi releases for china will come under intense scrutiny ing s sakpal provided his take on past and expected figures the manufacturing pmi has been in sub 50 contractionary territory since december which is where we see it staying in march weak pmi surveys square with the hard data on industrial production showing a sharp slowdown in the first two months of the year which sets gdp growth on course for a further slowdown in 1q19 advertisement given the rbi s recent and somewhat surprising shift to neutral the outcome of the central bank s upcoming bi monthly monetary policy review is expected to also draw investor focus with market participants now leaning towards a further 25 basis point cut to key policy rates ing s sakpal wrote the rbi was the first asian central bank to ease policy this year cutting key interest rates by 25 basis points at the last meeting in february and now there is a near unanimous consensus for another 25 basis point cut next week adding we have joined the consensus revising our earlier forecast of stable rates for the rest of the year however the expected easing comes under what could be considered duress as the investors continue to question the rbi s independence from governmental influence with indian elections due to commence in the coming weeks the central bank have been under pressure from the incumbent modi led government to ease lending restrictions in a bid to garner support out with pressure from the government inflation appears to have bottomed out and be returning to the upside as the negative drag of lower oil prices recedes and growth appears to be well supported by domestic demand leading some analysts to question the expected rbi rate cut according to the latest poll of economists conducted by reuters bullish positions on the indian rupee inr had soared through march with investors backing the now best performing asian currency to continue to outperform amid polls suggesting narendra modi is expected to retain the premiership the reuter s poll also suggested that investors were bearish on the indonesian rupiah idr following the dovish shift by the fed and growing expectations that the indonesian central bank could reverse some of 2018 s multiple interest rate hikes according to the survey findings investors had also flipped on the philippine peso php with a bearish expectation developing following last week s central bank policy meeting in which policy makers left the benchmark interest rate unchanged but acknowledged that risks to economic growth could worsen in 2019 above asia economic calendar
the world economy is showing signs of significantly lower growth if not an outright recession with the warning lights flashing in both financial markets and the real economy in the past week the yield on us 10 year treasury bonds has fallen sharply and on some occasions has dropped below the rate on shorter term treasuries this is significant because under normal circumstances rates on longer term bonds are higher than those obtained on short term debt the inversion of the yield curve points to rising financial uncertainty as investors seek greater security and is regarded as an indicator of recession other interest rates most notably on german bonds that like us treasuries are regarded as a safe haven have also fallen and in some cases are in negative territory on wednesday the german government issued 2 4 billion of 10 year bonds with an interest rate of minus 0 05 percent the issue was oversubscribed 2 6 times meaning they could have raised 6 3 trillion the growing nervousness in financial markets is also indicated in a report from bloomberg earlier this week which said the amount of global bonds with a negative yield had gone over 10 trillion negative yield occurs when the price of the bond rises so high due to investors seeking security that if it were held to maturity it would produce a loss on the investment the immediate starting point of this shift was the indication from the us federal reserve following the meeting of its federal open market committee fomc earlier this month that it was contemplating no interest rate increases this year a sharp reversal from the position at the end of last year when at least two interest rates were anticipated for 2019 the switch by the fed started in january with the issuing of a dovish statement in interest rates in response to a sharp downturn in us stock markets for december when they experienced the worst outcome for that month since 1931 the statement following this month s fomc meeting made clear the fed was not simply engaged in a temporary reversal of its previous agenda it was a virtual admission there was not going to be any winding back of its massive asset purchases under the program of quantitative easing which saw its balance sheet expand from around 800 billion before the financial crisis to 4 5 trillion the fed had started winding back its holdings by 50 billion a month and fed chairman jerome powell indicated at the end of last year this policy would proceed into the future as if on auto pilot this brought furious opposition from key sections of the financial markets which maintained the fed s policy was adversely affecting their operations at last week s meeting the wind down was effectively shelved powell said the fed would slow the reduction of treasury holdings to 15 billion a month starting in may and expected to conclude the wind down at the end of september this meant that the fed s balance sheet would be around 3 5 trillion or 17 percent of gdp compared to around 6 percent before the 2008 meltdown the most significant feature of the fed s decision is what it indicates about the future of the us and global economy it underscores the fact that more than 10 years after the global financial crash any return to what was once considered normal monetary policy is further away than ever and the global economy and financial system are completely dependent on the provision of ultra cheap money from the major central banks commenting on the latest move by the fomc wall street journal writer greg ip noted that the us economy was expected to grow this year and that official unemployment remains low what s worrying is than maintaining these conditions requires such expansive monetary policy it suggests that powerful underlying forces such as slow growing populations and diminished investment opportunities continue to weigh on economic growth and inflation around the world he pointed out that if the us economy stumbled again the fed would not have much ammunition to respond because at most it could cut interest rates a little more than two percentage points less than half what s required in most recessions recent reports suggest that the next fed move on rates could be down rather than up shortly after the fed s decision another shock came in the form of data from europe on the underlying state of the euro zone economy the purchasing managers index for euro zone manufacturing fell to 47 7 in march from 49 4 in february with a level under 50 indicating a contraction in germany the euro zone s key economy the index for the factory sector slumped to 44 7 in march down from 47 6 in february to hit its lowest reading in 79 months on wednesday at a conference in frankfurt european central bank president mario draghi provided an update on the state of the euro zone economy following the decision by the ecb earlier this month to reverse its policy of slight monetary tightening and undertake new stimulus measures he said last year saw a loss of growth momentum that had extended into 2019 the main factor at work is the slowing demand from external markets indicating a slowing of the global economy weakness in world trade had continued and global goods import growth in january reached its lowest level since the great recession on the back of rising uncertainty about trade disputes and a slowdown in emerging market economies especially china industrial production fell by 4 2 percent in december before recovering somewhat in january but indicators such as new export orders that have historically been closely associated with industrial production remained in negative territory draghi noted that both extra and intra euro area slowed steeply last year and that such a simultaneous downturn has not occurred since the start of the global financial crisis draghi tried to put the best face on an increasingly worsening situation saying that so far the decline in external demand had not spilled over into domestic demand but the risks had risen in the past few months he concluded his remarks with the assurance that the ecb was ready to respond to future risks and we are not short of instruments to deliver on our mandate this claim was the subject of a scathing response by ashoka mody a former deputy director of the international monetary fund s research and european departments and now a professor at princeton university which was reported in the uk based telegraph what instruments he asked aside from its jumble of words the ecb has nothing else to offer mody said the ecb was riven by national conflicts always acted too late with delays and half measures which were the antithesis of risk management so far the official position in the us is that the economy will continue to grow this year the fed has revised down its forecast from 2 3 percent last december to 2 1 percent but according to powell it still remains in a good place although growth had slowed from solid rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 earlier this month new york times columnist david leonhardt provided some insights into the longer term situation pointing out the strength of us economic expansion was exaggerated here s the truth there is no boom the economy has been mired in an extended funk since the financial crisis ended in 2010 gdp growth still has not reached 3 percent in any year and 3 percent isn t a very high bar he wrote that if experts predictions on the growth of the us economy had actually eventuated then it would be 6 percent larger than it is today producing 1 3 trillion more in goods and services one of the reasons he noted was that major companies despite all the money that was available were holding back a report released earlier this week pointed to one of the reasons why companies in the s p 500 spent a record 806 billion buying back their own shares in 2018 beating the figure for 2017 by almost 56 percent and shattering the previous record of 589 billion set in 2007 these figures underscore the fact that the chief effect of the various stimulus measures introduced by central banks and governments the program of quantitative easing and the trump corporate tax cuts has been to further fuel parasitism and speculation while signs of recession indicate that a new crisis is in the making

27 march 2019 jean woo and shen mei bolton cover legal trends and developments in the singapore fund finance market this article was originally published in the singapore chapter of fund finance 2019 the leading publication on fund finance by global legal insights which provides financial institutions funds and investors with a comprehensive insight on twenty jurisdictions worldwide singapore is widely recognised as a leading fund management hub in asia in a seminal speech to the singapore parliament on the importance of the fund industry ms indranee rajah singapore s second minister for finance and education highlighted that singapore s assets under management aum have expanded at a 15 compound annual growth rate over the last five years reaching s 3 3 trillion approximately us 2 4 trillion at the end of 2017 she also noted that at present approximately seven out of every ten singapore dollars under management are invested into the asia pacific region reflecting singapore s role as a key node for fund managers and investors to invest in the region s growth opportunities leading the charge are venture capital private equity and corporate venture funds which in the first eight months of 2018 accounted for some us 5 8 billion worth of investments made in south east asia 1 within this pot venture capital investments accounted for us 3 16 billion surpassing the us 2 7 billion invested in the same sector for the whole of 2017 the verb to eclipse has been used to describe the pace of continued growth of the venture capital industry in asia pacific economies in 2018 as compared to the other regions 2 asia focused venture capital assets under management have more than doubled since december 2014 us 88 billion in 2014 vs us 221 billion in 2017 rivaling those of the us in their scale and diversity in this chapter we will provide an overview of the funds markets in singapore in 2018 then we will examine some of the important attributes of singapore as an asset management hub next from a legal and regulatory perspective we will look at some key considerations of a fund finance structure in singapore and highlight the main regulatory developments for the year finally we will conclude by looking ahead to the outlook in 2019 growth of the unicorns in singapore in finance a unicorn is a privately held start up company with a current valuation of us 1 billion or more the term was coined in 2013 by venture capitalist aileen lee who chose the mythical animal to represent the statistical rarity of such successful ventures due to the recent success of a number of start ups it is becoming less of a rarity but more of an industry accolade to be termed as a unicorn southeast asia and in particular singapore currently has the most number of unicorns in asia after china these include grab go jek lazada razer sea ltd traveloka and tokopedia it was reported that singapore received the most funding from vc investors accounting for 67 of the total investment in southeast asia of us 14 9 billion followed by indonesia at 22 3 the ride hailing industry attracted the most attention from vc investors in the third quarter of 2018 the two most notable deals were the us 1 5 billion investment in go jek by investors including google inc temasek holdings meituan dianping tencent and jd com and the us 2 billion raised by singapore based grab in new funding from investors didi chuxing softbank toyota oppenheimerfunds ping an capital and others the above grab funding is currently the largest single funding round that has ever been raised by a start up in southeast asia based on most recent valuations grab has now joined the ranks of an exclusive category of so called decacorns which is a term given to start ups that are worth us 10 billion or more there are approximately around 15 decacorns worldwide these include uber 68 billion didi chuxing 50 billion xiaomi 46 billion airbnb 29 billion and palantir technologies 20 billion 4 what does this mean for singapore as we look further afield at the wider ecosystem it is unsurprising that the surge in venture capital investments has gone hand in hand with the exponential growth of the fintech and e commerce industry in singapore according to the kpmg pulse of fintech report singapore achieved a record high of us 299 1 million of fintech funding in 2017 this was attributed to two of asia s top 10 biggest deals taking place in singapore in q4 2017 goswiff s us 100 million purchase by paynear solutions which boosted deal volume to an unmatched high over the prior three years and smartkarma s us 13 5 million series b round the singapore government has been instrumental in encouraging fintech development in the country in 2016 the monetary authority of singapore mas 5 followed closely in the footsteps of the uk financial conduct authority fca by establishing a regulatory sandbox framework for financial institutions and companies to test their innovative products in a safe and controlled environment the objective of a sandbox is to enable fintech experiments to take place within a controlled environment where legal and regulatory requirements are relaxed in certain specified ways in order for the new technology to be tested before being applied on a wider scale policypal a digital insurance broker that enables customers to manage and purchase their insurance policies through its app became the first company in singapore to graduate from the sandbox in 2017 graduation from the sandbox means that policypal is now a licensed insurance broker 6 singapore success as a key asset management hub singapore s success as a key asset management and vc hub can be attributed to some of the following factors strong tax incentives the singapore government has put in place several tax treaties and incentives for fund managers to attract them to operate in singapore this is important because a business entity is generally liable to tax in any jurisdiction where its activities have created a taxable presence due to the varied sources of its funds and investment destinations a fund manager is likely to have taxable activities in a number of jurisdictions the tax impact of doing business between singapore and these other jurisdictions is an important consideration for any fund manager singapore is an attractive destination from a tax perspective it currently has more than 82 double tax treaties with various countries especially those in the asia pacific region a double tax treaty between singapore and another jurisdiction serves to prevent double taxation of income earned in one jurisdiction by a resident of the other jurisdiction through the provisions of the tax treaty a fund manager can benefit from the elimination of or reduction in double taxation between singapore and the respective treaty country a fund manager is also generally incentivised to base its activities in singapore as a singapore tax resident fund has access to several tax exemption schemes for example an offshore fund managed by a singapore based fund manager may be exempt from tax on income from designated investments such exemptions are also given to fund managers to encourage them to base their fund vehicles in singapore separately singapore based or offshore funds may also enjoy tax exemptions for income and gains on designated investments made by the fund under an enhanced tier fund scheme in view of the above it is therefore unsurprising that outside of the traditional offshore funds jurisdictions such as the cayman islands singapore is now regarded as having one of the most attractive tax regimes for funds and fund managers robust regulatory regime singapore is widely seen as a jurisdiction with a transparent and robust regulatory regime for fund management companies these include for example rules requiring independent custody and valuation of investor assets if the type and size of investments managed by the fund management companies exceed certain thresholds it will have to put in place an adequate risk management framework and be required to undergo independent annual audits by external auditors a strong regulatory regime may increase the administrative burden and cost on fund managers however it has the benefit of reinforcing the high level of professional duty of care that fund managers owe to their investors in the longer run a robust regulatory regime will help strengthen singapore s reputation as a trusted fund management jurisdiction rule of law singapore s economic success is built on the familiarity and stability of its legal rules and system the legal system of singapore is based on the english common law system the general view is that investors find singapore a safe and business friendly destination because they are protected equally under singapore law singapore sits at the very top of the world bank s global ratings no 1 of 189 countries for its effectiveness in enforcing contracts and protecting minority investor rights it is ranked second in the world in both the heritage foundation s index of economic freedom and the world economic forum s global competitiveness index with high marks for its protection of property rights and freedom from corruption general credit and security considerations in singapore singapore has branded itself as a global hub for finance according to the latest world bank annual ratings released in 2018 it is ranked number 2 among 190 economies in the ease of doing business one of the key indices of this ranking is the effectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy laws in facilitating lending below is an overview of some of the credit and security considerations when structuring a financing transaction in singapore 1 foreign currency exchange there are generally no exchange controls in singapore however mas does issue guidelines and notices in relation to lending in specific currencies for example there is currently a limit on the amount which banks in singapore may lend singapore dollars to non resident financial institutions 7 fortunately such restriction which is targeted at bank to bank lending is not particularly applicable for most commercial lending transactions where lending is to a corporate vehicle 2 provision of security or guarantee to offshore lenders unlike more heavily regulated countries like china and india there are fewer restrictions on offshore lending structures singapore companies are generally not restricted from providing security or guarantees in favour of foreign lenders however legal considerations relating to financial assistance interested party transactions corporate benefit priorities and procedures and formalities relating to the granting of security and guarantee generally apply 3 agency and trust concepts these are recognised in singapore and accordingly a security agent or a security trustee may hold security on trust for a group of lenders this is important as it facilitates security being granted in favour of a security trustee who holds the security property on trust for the floating group of lenders which may include the new transferee lender 4 withholding stamp and other taxes matters relating to tax differ on a case by case basis however from a lending perspective parties typically have to consider costs relating to withholding and stamp duties taxes fortunately in the singapore these costs are not typically regarded as being substantial withholding tax payments of interest and other payments in connection to loans to non singapore tax resident lenders are generally subject to singapore withholding tax the current withholding tax rate is 15 of the gross payment however the repayment of principal sums will not be subject to singapore withholding tax here are some notable exceptions and exemptions payments of interest and other payments in connection to a loan given by a singapore tax resident lender or singapore branch of a non singapore resident financial institution are exempt from singapore withholding tax if the non resident bank is a tax treaty country the avoidance of double taxation agreement may provide for a different reduced tax rate 8 thin capitalisation rules in general interest payments are tax deductible if incurred on capital employed in acquiring the income singapore does not have thin capitalisation provisions to limit the amount of tax deductible interest stamp duties stamp duty is payable on a mortgage equitable mortgage or debenture of any immovable property and stocks or shares a legal mortgage is subject to ad valorem duty at the rate of 0 4 of the amount of facilities granted on the mortgage of immovable property or stocks and shares subject to a maximum of s 500 an equitable mortgage is subject to ad valorem duty at the rate of 0 2 of the amount of facilities granted on the mortgage of immovable property subject to a maximum of s 500 5 notarisation not required for security documents which are executed and used in singapore 6 corporate power unless otherwise limited or restricted by the provisions of its own constitutive documents a company has full capacity to perform any act including entering into lending security or guarantee documents though the disposal of all or substantially all of the assets of a singapore incorporated company will require a special shareholder resolution to be passed care needs to be taken however in relation to companies with old forms of constitutive documents as they may contain restrictions and limits which will continue to apply fund finance in singapore 1 what is a capital call facility a capital call facility also known as funds subscription finance or equity bridge finance is a form of short term financing provided to a fund such financings are typically structured as revolving facilities secured on the investors undrawn commitments the duration of the facility is typically not longer than three years and often shorter however as limited partnership agreements typically restrict any borrowing beyond a year each loan made to the fund must be repaid within a year of its drawing to comply with the requirements of the limited partnership agreement capital call facilities originate from the funds markets in the us and europe where the facilities are commonly used to bridge the gap between when an investment is made by the fund and when capital contributions are received from investors to finance that investment loans are repaid with capital contributions once received from investors in asia such facilities were historically popular with real estate funds however as the market in asia evolved these facilities became more prevalent in a broad range of specialty funds and sponsors including infrastructure private debt and other specialty private equity funds in this respect asset backed facilities where the financing is provided against the asset value of the fund are now not uncommon more recently hybrid structures which are a combination of a capital call facility and an asset backed facility have also begun to emerge 2 governing law the governing law for asian capital call facilities can vary and often depends on the identity and jurisdiction of the banks funds and investors however the use of us and english law governed documents are the most prevalent in particular english law is a popular choice for governing law in this region this is because freedom of contract is widely regarded as a key principle upheld by the english courts the principle emphasises the importance of upholding the parties commercial bargain 3 security package an important feature of a capital call facility is the security package most capital call facilities in asia are provided on a secured basis the security package for asian funds financings is similar to those in european and north american facilities it typically consists of an assignment of call rights and grant of security interest over the account to which any capital call proceeds are to be paid the governing law of a security document will typically follow the law of the jurisdiction in which the secured asset is deemed to be located the lex situs in most cases singapore law will be used if the funds documentation is governed by singapore law and or if the relevant bank account is located in singapore the principles of singapore law in respect of the creation of security over these assets are similar to the common law concepts established under english law however despite the similarities it is important to liaise with singapore counsel as there are practical and procedural requirements specific to singapore law which the parties will need to fulfil to perfect the security which may differ from english law or other common law regimes 4 formalities as a general principle under singapore law a legal assignment must be in writing signed by the assignor absolute and notified in writing to any persons against whom the assignor could enforce the assigned rights if any of these formalities are not complied with it is an equitable assignment an equitable assignment is less desirable from an assignee s perspective as the assignee can usually only bring an action against the contract counterparty in its own name if it has a legal assignment with an equitable assignment the assignee will usually be required to join in proceedings with the assignor this may be problematic if the assignor is no longer available or interested in participating 5 registration in addition a registrable charge created by a singapore company has to be registered under section 131 of the companies act cap 50 2006 rev ed the companies act with the accounting and corporate regulatory authority of singapore acra within 30 days from the date the instrument of charge was created a registrable charge that is not registered within the time limit is void against the liquidator and other creditors of the company 6 priority similar to other common law jurisdictions the rules determining the priority of charges under singapore law are fairly complex as a general principle the relevant time for determining priority between charges is the time of creation of the charges a prior equitable charge will be defeated by a subsequent bona fide legal chargee for value who had no actual or constructive notice of the prior charge with regards to an assignment over call rights the priority of an assignment will generally follow the order in which an assignment is made however a subsequent assignee will have priority over a prior assignee without notice of the prior assignment if the subsequent assignee is the first to give notice of their assignment to the counterparty it is therefore critical in an assignment over call rights to ensure that the notice of assignment is duly served on the relevant counterparty on creation of the assignment key regulatory developments the singapore parliament passed the variable capital companies vcc bill on 2 october 2018 to create the legal framework for a new type of singapore legal entity the variable capital company the vcc the new legislation is regarded by some as a game changer for the republic s fast growing fund management industry as it is a separate and bespoke legal regime developed specifically for a funds vehicle the vcc has features which make it more attractive to fund managers to operate it as a funds vehicle on an ongoing basis at present a substantial proportion of funds managed and operated by fund managers in singapore are domiciled in more established offshore jurisdictions like the cayman islands dublin and luxembourg repetition breeds familiarity and familiarity breeds investor confidence investors choose these jurisdictions to incorporate their funds due largely to the familiarity which investors have with regards to the legal and regulatory regime in these jurisdictions as a result most of the economic benefits generated by service providers to these investment funds accrue outside of singapore the singapore government s strategy is simple by attracting funds to be domiciled and managed from singapore supporting professional service providers for example lawyers bankers accountants will also benefit from the activity generated by a vibrant funds industry to encourage the existing pool of funds to switch to singapore the bill provides for a redomiciliation mechanism for existing overseas investment funds constituted as corporate structures similar to vccs in addition to facilitate existing funds to switch to a vcc structure those funds using corporate structures like private limited companies trusts and limited partnerships can take advantage of the new vcc regime to restructure and become a vcc key features of a variable capital company vcc and its benefits as a funds vehicle the vcc is incorporated under the vcc act instead of the companies act ca this enables the vcc to function as a corporate structure tailored specifically for investment funds a vcc will have the flexibility to issue and redeem shares without having to seek shareholders approval this allows investors to exit their investments in the investment fund when they wish to and pay dividends using its capital this is in contrast to the company structure that has restrictions on capital reduction and can only pay dividends out of profits the vcc may be established as a standalone fund or as an umbrella fund with multiple sub funds the umbrella with sub funds structure creates economies of scale each sub fund can share a common board of directors and use the same service providers including the same fund manager custodian auditor and administrative agent as a safeguard for vcc shareholders and to enhance creditor protection the assets and liabilities of each sub fund will be ring fenced from other sub funds the vcc will allow for a wider scope of accounting standards to be used in preparing financial statements which helps to serve the needs of global investors apart from singapore accounting standards and recommended accounting principles international financial reporting standards ifrs and us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap can be used by vccs the year ahead according to hank paulson the ex chief of goldman sachs and former us treasury secretary we live in a time of unprecedented risks he commented that over the course of my 50 year career with the exception of the 2008 financial crisis i have never seen the public and private sectors buffeted by so much risk these new risks are not financial but they are unprecedented in their character not just their scope 9 despite the above the outlook for the funds finance and funds formation market for singapore still looks strong the imf and the world bank chose to hold their annual meetings in indonesia this year to demonstrate how the region has grown in the 20 years since the asian currency crisis there are certain headwinds the us china trade war is rattling the international markets and asia is likely to be caught in the crossfire both the united states and china have already imposed us 34 billion of new tariffs on each other s imports in a tit for tat tariff row that shows little signs of abating it is estimated that every 10 drop in china s exports could reduce the growth rate of asian economies by an average of 1 1 percentage points 10 closer to home domestic politics in the surrounding region are likely to weigh heavily on growth prospects for singapore election uncertainty in indonesia and thailand are issues which the market is monitoring closely in light of the above some may feel that the challenges above may trigger capital outflow from the region but others believe that it may unearth opportunities for savvy investors for further information please contact jean woo ashurst jean woo ashurst adtlaw com 1 based on data released by

drastic turnaround for stocks after a jarring 14 percent sell off in the last three months of 2018 the market s blockbuster quarter shared the spotlight with lyft s much anticipated trading debut on the nasdaq stock exchange the ride hailing company s shares finished at 78 29 or 8 7 percent above its offering price of 72 new data pointing to lower inflation and renewed optimism among investors

reassured investors who d worried that the fed would continue to raise rates amid signs of a slowing global economy as disappointing and perhaps shocking as the sell off in the fourth quarter was with the fed getting out of the way the rebound has been equally as shocking said baele essentially we re just back to where we were in october the first quarter s strength helped prolong the bull market

managing director of the international monetary fund imf has cautioned nations to be prepared to face the consequences of an unexpected slow growth of the world economy imf has also adjusted downward global growth forecast 3 7 to 3 5 percent for 2019 imf and its chief look very reasonable in not painting a bright picture of the global economy because things in and between powerful resourceful nations are getting complicated day by day no exception are the less resourceful countries one cannot also brush aside apprehensions of some observers that multilateralism is being gradually replaced by bilateralism and liberalism by protectionism a period of unhealthy competition between major global powers is seen which could lead to an unpredictable and more hostile future it looks like the post cold war period of optimism is slowly fading people are also confused about the new order likely to emerge and are not certain whether the transition period will be peaceful leaders from other relatively less powerful countries including the european union eu are expected to do some meaningful work to preserve a liberal international order but it does not look like they are well prepared to deal with the heightened competition let us see how effective a role can angela markel of germany serving her last term in office play in defending multilateralism notwithstanding some positive developments that took place between the two presidents of china and the us on the sidelines of the g 20 meeting in buenos aires trade row between these two largest economies is far from over both economies have taken the hit chinese economy is reported to have grown by 6 6 percent in 2018 the lowest in three decades chinese exports in february have dropped sharply and it is believed that the huge current account surplus it has been enjoying since 1993 could soon disappear trade row has not benefitted the us economy either pork and soybean farmers have suffered a lot there one encouraging fact however is that imposition of additional tariff has stopped albeit temporarily and officials of both countries are meeting regularly to resolve outstanding issues hope the row which is bound to negatively impact the global economy is resolved soon britain s exit from eu brexit has also created lots of confusion and is likely to hurt countries on either side of the channel prime minister may has already failed twice to get the brexit deal passed by the house of commons about a million people protested on march 23 in london demanding a second referendum on brexit the confusion has begun to take a toll on the british economy it is reported that banks and financial institutions have moved their assets approximating 10 trillion dollar outside of britain bank of england has warned of serious consequences which could be more dangerous than the ones created by the financial crisis of 2008 it is rightly observed that brexit proceedings will continue to inflict injury on the economies of eu nations and britain for years to come a reliable estimate shows that around 700 000 jobs in travel and tourism could be lost across europe in the event of britain dashing out without a deal with eu on future relations imf states that british economy will be 7 7 percent smaller over the next decade in a no deal scenario theresa may needs lots of good luck to delay and get the deal passed by the british parliament venezuelan crisis is also not likely to recede soon many inhabitants of this oil rich country have left it to take refuse elsewhere and those staying back are without water electricity and other essential supplies we can simply pray that the innocent people do not have to suffer much for long like the unfortunate syrians things are not very pleasant in our neighborhood either india making necessary preparations for the general elections and pakistan with a new government after the freshly concluded elections were on the verge of a full fledged war after a deadly suicide bombing in india s section of kashmir killed more than 40 indian soldiers in february the two nuclear armed nations got engaged in a brief air confrontation in which both sides claimed that they had shot down each other s war planes thanks god the concerned leaders sensibly handled the delicate situation and fears of an all out conflict are almost over at least for now emerging economic power india has dedicated leaders to do everything possible to help their economy remain not far away from the two economies us and china leapfrogging many economies in coming years and pakistan s imran khan does not seem to be in a war mood because he has the uphill task of putting on track somewhat derailed economy of pakistan sensible leaders all over the world are seen giving top priority to the wellbeing of their countrymen which is effected through faster economic development let us see what is happening in nepal overall position of the economy is not satisfactory but there are a few areas to derive some solace from one of the sectors which has been giving some good results in recent times is the tourism sector which has registered a commendable increase more than 100 000 in february in the number of tourist arrival if this trend continues it will not be difficult to get 2 million tourists here in 2020 as desired by the government remittance is also increasing very encouragingly both in terms of american dollars and nepalese currency it may be mentioned that remittance increased by rs 77billion in the seventh month of this fiscal year to reach rs 515 55 billion in seven months registering an increase of 28 5 percent over the corresponding period of last fiscal year this sharp increase in remittance could not however arrest the deterioration in our current account which has reached rs 166 billion in the seventh month of this fiscal year as against rs 142 billion in the corresponding period of last fiscal year balance of payment bop is still negative by rs 49 billion in the seven months as against a negative rs 18 billion in the corresponding period of last fiscal year foreign direct investment rs 5 15 billion is seen to have taken a hit during this period as it stood at rs 14 34 billion in the seven months of the last fiscal year capital transfer is also said to have gone down further foreign exchange reserve at the end of last fiscal year was 10 08 billion dollar and it is 9 49 billion dollar in the seven months of this fiscal year while it is not unusual for government to have some money more than rs 150 billion currently lying idle at the central bank the worrisome fact is that only 25 percent of the money apportioned under capital expenditure head was spent till the end of the seventh month and it has reached just 30 percent in more than eight months of this fiscal year financial institutions have been charging high interest rates on loans citing liquidity crunch in the market and finance minister s strong directive to the institutions to lower the lending rates and prime minister oli s threatening that he would intervene if rates are not lowered have passed unheeded in hindsight many of us now realize how mistaken we were to hope that oli would intervene soon to facilitate injection of billions of rupees into the market poor production base and the resultant ballooning trade deficit are the root cause of many evils that have been inflicting somewhat incurable injury on the economy the deterioration is difficult to be arrested as is evident by a comparison of data of six seven months of this fiscal year with the corresponding period of last fiscal year it may not be easy for the concerned to tell commoners at the yearend that their period was better than the last one because situation both internally and externally does not look that easy things on the other side of the fence noneconomic also look complicated and confusing a blast in the valley in the last week of february claiming one life and injuring two others and arson attacks targeting at least a dozen telephone towers of a mobile company ncell in several districts came as something reminiscent of the violent incidents of the maoist war era period netra bikram chand led maoist party owned up to the attacks and apologized for the loss of life but has shown no sign of renouncing violence the government s decision to outlaw the party has become very controversial and people are skeptical whether chand would come to the negotiating table surrendering arms as desired by the current dispensation it may be interesting to note that several calls by different governments to surrender arms before negotiation had failed to produce positive outcome during the decade long period of insurgency led by prachanda equally controversial became the eleven point deal signed between government and c k raut a known separatist wanting a separate independent madhesh let us hope that raut now heading a political party must have realized that the southern plain of nepal seceding from the mainland is just impossible little bit disturbing was also the decision of rashtriya janata party rjp withdrawing its support to the government despite the fact that this decision will have no impact on the continuity of this still strong government things however will be different if rjp leaders succeed in pulling the upendra yadav led party forum out of government to expedite their merger talks may be disturbed a bit by the unconducive environment both internal and external finance minister khatiwada has recently adjusted downward some budgetary targets made public by him just six months ago total budgetary outlay has been reduced by about 9 percent and its other constituents have also been readjusted according to the new arrangement recurrent expenditure is fixed at rs 798 billion capital expenditure at rs 265 billion and financial management stands at rs 135 billion revenue collection target of rs 945 billion has been slashed by rs 26 billion it may be recalled that revenue collection target could not be met last fiscal year for the first time in a decade and the concerned may have difficulty collecting even the downsized figure in the current fiscal year budgetary adjustments are made and there is nothing to panic about it but government should be extra careful to make sure that the revised targets do not remain unachieved the government has to be sensitive also because of the fact that nepal investment summit is taking place march 29 and 30 at a time when the situation is not very favorable to attract investors who love to meticulously delve into different aspects related to the country and its economy before committing funds in addition to the law and order situation our repeated disappointing performance in meeting the capital expenditure target may stand as an impediment to mobilizing huge resources externally adequate homework is needed to get the firm commitment otherwise investors will hesitate to pledge and whatever little is promised will not be timely disbursed a wide gap is found between pledging and its actualization which has been abundantly shown by our experiences related to the devastating earthquake of april 2015 and the nepal investment summit in 2017 that succeeded in getting pledges worth 14 billion dollars good luck

2018 hudbay acquired control of a large contiguous block of mineral rights to explore for mineable deposits within trucking distance of the constancia processing facility including the past producing caballito property and the highly prospective maria reyna and kusiorcco properties hudbay has commenced permitting community relations and technical activities required to access and conduct drilling on these properties and has been successful in reaching an agreement covering two of the properties to date with plans to drill in the fourth quarter of 2019 the caballito property located approximately three kilometres northwest of constancia is a 120 hectare 297 acre concession block and is the site of the former katanga mine which was operated by mitsui mining smelting co ltd and minera katanga at different times between the late 1970s and early 1990s the deposit at caballito is believed to consist of narrow skarn bodies developed in the contact between limestone and monzonite porphyries with copper silver and gold mineralization in hypogene sulfides the maria reyna property located within ten kilometres of constancia is a 5 850 hectare 14 456 acre concession block in 2010

progressing following the election of a new community council in the fourth quarter of 2018 hudbay continues to take a disciplined measured and patient approach to these negotiations as this has proven to be an effective way of engaging in previous instances and is consistent with its proven long term strategy for securing social license and developing its business in peru lalor mine the lalor mine achieved ore production of more than 4 500 tonnes per day in february 2019 and production since then has been in line with expectations in february 2019 hudbay announced increased mineral reserves and mineral resources for the lalor mine and nearby satellite deposits and a new mine plan that includes the processing of gold and copper gold ore at the company s new britannia mill the company expects lalor annual gold production to more than double from current levels once the new britannia mill is refurbished in 2022 average annual production of approximately 140 000 ounces is

accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in canada which differ from the requirements of united states securities laws canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the canadian securities administrators national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 43 101 subject to the sec modernization rules described below the united states reporting requirements are currently governed by the united states securities and exchange commission sec industry guide 7 sec industry guide 7 under the securities act of 1933 as amended the definitions used in ni 43 101 are incorporated by reference from the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum cim definition standards adopted by cim council on may 10 2014 the cim definition standards for example the terms mineral reserve proven mineral reserve and probable mineral reserve are canadian mining terms as defined in ni 43 101 and these definitions differ from the definitions in sec industry guide 7 furthermore while the terms mineral resource measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are defined in and required to be disclosed by ni 43 101 these terms are not defined terms under sec industry guide 7 under sec industry guide 7 standards a final or bankable feasibility study is required to report reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority further under sec industry guide 7 mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made reserve estimates contained in this news release may not qualify as reserves under sec industry guide 7 further until recently the sec has not recognized the reporting of mineral deposits which do not meet the sec industry guide 7 definition of reserve the sec adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended these amendments became effective february 25 2019 the sec modernization rules with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after january 1 2021 the sec modernization rules replace the historical disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in sec industry guide 7 which will be rescinded from and after the required compliance date of the sec modernization rules as a result of the adoption of the sec modernization rules the sec now recognizes estimates of measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources in addition the sec has amended its definitions of proven mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves to be substantially similar to the corresponding cim definition standards incorporated by reference in ni 43 101 united states investors are cautioned that while the above terms are substantially similar to cim definitions there are differences in the definitions under the sec modernization rules and the cim definition standards accordingly there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the company may report as proven mineral reserves probable mineral reserves measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources under ni 43 101 would be the same had the company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the sec modernization rules united states investors are also cautioned that while the sec will now recognize measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources investors should not assume that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves accordingly investors are cautioned not to assume that any measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources that the company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable further inferred mineral resources have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically therefore united states investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the inferred mineral resources exist in accordance with canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies except in limited circumstances where permitted under ni 43 101 for the above reasons information contained in this

worried that the fed would continue to raise rates amid signs of a slowing global economy as disappointing and perhaps shocking as the sell off in the fourth quarter was with the fed getting out of the way the rebound has been equally as shocking said baele essentially we re just back to where we were in october the first quarter s strength helped prolong the bull market for u s stocks which

economists believe growth has slowed this year due to weaker growth prospects in china and europe the dampening effects on u s exports from the trump administration s trade battles and the waning

welcome to the last trading day of the quarter and what a quarter it s been we ve seen quite a turnaround after the market tanked late last year on worries about global economic growth stemming from the u s china trade war and concerns about a potentially too aggressive fed one leg of the market s recovery this quarter has come from increasing optimism that the u s and china can get a deal done to normalize trade relations affecting billions of dollars of goods flowing around the globe that optimism extended into this morning after treasury secretary steven mnuchin tweeted that talks in beijing had been constructive the other major leg of support has been a fed that has adopted a decidedly dovish stance helping boost the s p 500 by more than 12 this year through thursday s close one reason the central bank has given for holding off on more rate hikes has been muted inflation the latest inflation data from this morning showed the core personal consumption expenditures price index which strips out volatile food and energy prices and is the fed s preferred measure of inflation increased 0 1 month over month in january that s a lower reading than a briefing com consensus expectation of 0 2 and continues to reinforce what the fed has been saying about muted inflation meanwhile ride hailing service lyft is hitting public trading this morning beating its rival uber to an initial public offering the company now valued at about 24 billion has priced its shares at the top of its range at 72 per share shares will trade on the nasdaq under the ticker lyft in other corporate news carmax inc kmx shares were up more than 5 8 this morning after the used car retailer s earnings beat expectations revenue was below analyst estimates optimism on trade after taking a back seat recently the optimism on the trade front was rekindled on thursday as mnuchin and u s trade representative robert lighthizer were in beijing for a fresh round of talks between the world s two largest economies reuters reported that china has made unprecedented proposals on issues including forced technology transfer but that there wasn t a definite timetable for a deal another round of negotiations is scheduled for next week in washington this continues a pattern we ve been seeing where drips of seemingly good news come out and the market reacts positively but continues to be in the dark about the exact nature of where the negotiations are at and what key issues are getting hammered out president trump has already extended a deadline that could have seen the u s increase tariffs on chinese goods and it remains to be seen how much longer the talks will drag on it s possible that investor fatigue about the trade issue has set in limiting thursday s gains pessimism on the economy but it also appears that worries about the economy probably put a cap on any upside for wall street yesterday as well even as the fed has adopted a dovish stance and european central bankers have also stood pat on interest rates keeping relatively easy money flowing to companies monetary policy makers on both sides of the atlantic ocean have also reduced their economic forecasts in line with the sobering assessments the u s government on thursday said the economy expanded less than previously thought in the final quarter of last year with its third estimate of q4 gdp showing an annualized rate of increase of 2 2 compared with a previous reading of 2 6 a briefing com consensus had expected a reading of 2 5 inversion in the yield curve the worry about economic growth has been tempering some of the enthusiasm on wall street recently with the recent concerns coming from the u s treasury market as investors don t expect an interest rate hike from the fed anytime soon and indeed have been increasing their bets in the futures markets of a rate decrease the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury has fallen below that of the 3 month treasury this atypical pattern hasn t happened for the 3 month 10 year spread since 2007 and often precedes recessions but it s not a sure bet just because we re seeing an inversion doesn t necessarily mean we re headed into a recession recessions do happen as a natural part of the business cycle but an inversion doesn t mean one is imminent and investors did get some respite thursday as the yield on the 10 year treasury rose a bit even though it didn t pop above the 3 month yield the rise in the 10 year yield and the optimism about the trade situation seemed to outweigh the worries about the yield curve inversion and the dismal gdp data to help bring down wall street s main fear gauge lower the cboe volatility index vix fell below 14 5 markedly lower than its high near 18 earlier in the week because it s the last day of the quarter there may be some extra volatility heading into the close as investors and traders may make larger than normal trades to adjust their portfolios before the quarter closes how the mighty have fallen in the world of commodities you ve probably heard of oil gold soybeans and wheat but consider palladium the main use for the silvery white metal is in catalytic converters in the automobile industry it s also used in jewelry and electronics palladium has been on a tear recently with spot prices hitting a record above 1 600 an ounce amid expectations of increased demand because of stricter emissions standards and a potential ban on exports from russia but this week is a different story as investors seem to have decided to book some profits spot palladium lost more than 7 thursday to just over 1 340 after having fallen more than 6 wednesday in what had been its biggest daily percentage loss in more than two years reuters reported noting selling pressure came as economic concerns and a weak technical picture prompted profit taking pressure on the metal also comes after the head of a major mining company said the recent price surge had created a bubble according to the financial times biotech m a this year so far has been pretty good for biotech companies in terms of merger and acquisition activity of all the m a deals announced so far this year health care companies account for a third of them in terms of dollar value according to investment research firm cfra and the deals aren t coming cheap for buyers targets in biotech m a deals announced this year are getting an average of a 111 premium to what they were trading at a weak prior to the deal announcement that s well over the 35 premium all m a deals are averaging year to date biotech companies and their drugs have grown in popularity as patient demand for their life saving therapies continues to rise and pricing power remains intact due to limited competition cfra said

the global militarisation index by max m mutschler and jan grebe for bonn international center for conversion bicc how do you determine if a society is too militarized what s driving high levels of militarization in different parts of the world finally what s the relationship between militarization and human development the answers to these question and others can be found in the latest edition of the global militarisation index compiled by bicc the global militarisation index gmi presents on an annual basis the relative weight and importance of a country s military apparatus in relation to its society as a whole the 2015 gmi covers 152 states and is based on the latest available figures in most cases data for 2014 the index project is financially supported by germany s federal ministry for economic cooperation and development bmz there are numerous sources of conflict around the world that are driving militarisation in many regions and inducing states to modernise their armed forces or increase defense budgets among the ten countries with the highest level of militarisation namely israel singapore armenia jordan south korea russia cyprus azerbaijan kuwait and greece three are in the middle east two in asia and five in europe the united states and china are absent from the gmi top 10 despite being global leaders in military spending this is because when their military expenditures are measured as a proportion of gross domestic product gdp and their military headcount and heavy weapon system numbers are measured per 1 000 inhabitants the situation looks rather different nevertheless they are following the trend towards restructuring and modernisation of the armed forces the region with the highest level of militarisation is again the middle east this upward trend must be seen in connection with the violent conflicts across the region the israel palestine conflict the war in yemen the civil war in syria and the regional threat posed by so called islamic state is in europe too we find high levels of militarisation current crises not least the war in eastern ukraine could become the factor that will push up defense budgets in the future there is also a local arms race between armenia and azerbaijan triggered by the nagorno karabakh conflict included for the first time in the 2015 gmi report is an examination of the relationships between militarisation and human development by considering the human development index hdi for stronger economies we find that a high gmi ranking is often accompanied by a high hdi value israel singapore the relationship between militarisation and human development may again differ in countries where a high gmi is combined with a low hdi such as chad or mauretania here disproportionately high spending on the armed forces may be taking critical resources away from development methodology of the global militarisation index gmi the global militarisation index gmi depicts the relative weight and importance of the military apparatus of one state in relation to its society as a whole for this the gmi records a number of indicators to represent the level of militarisation of a country the comparison of military expenditures with its gross domestic product gdp and its health expenditure as share of its gdp the contrast between the total number of para military forces and the number of physicians and the overall population the ratio of the number of heavy weapons systems available and the number of the overall population gmi indicators weighing factors the gmi is based on data from the stockholm peace research institute sipri the international monetary fund imf the world health organization who the international institute for strategic studies iiss and bicc it shows the levels of militarisation of 161 states since 1990 bicc provides yearly updates in order to increase the compatibility between different indicators and to prevent extreme values from creating distortions when normalising data in a first step every indicator has been represented in a logarithm with the factor 10 second all data have been normalised using the formula x y min max min with min and max representing respectively the lowest and the highest value of the logarithm in a third step every indicator has been weighted in accordance to a subjective factor reflecting the relative importance attributed to it by bicc researchers see graph below in order to calculate the final score the weighted indicators have been added up and then normalised one last time on a scale ranging from 0 to 1 000 for better comparison of individual years all years have finally been normalised the gmi conducts a detailed analysis of specific regional or national developments by doing so bicc wants to contribute to the debate on militarisation and point to the often contradictory distribution of resources bicc gmi militarisation remains a controversial concept the gmi is deliberately designed to avoid the normative assumption that militarisation always means an excessive emphasis on military power or that very high resource allocations necessarily have negative consequences for security or for overall social development instead the gmi approach does not only consider the scale of resources allocated to the military but relates them to the wider society among other criteria factored into the index are the proportions of gross domestic product gdp spent on the military and spent on health numerous sources of conflict across the world continue to fuel the arms dynamic in many regions and cause governments to modernise their armed forces or increase their defense budget apart from rivalries between states such conflicts largely involve internal armed struggles civil wars uprisings unresolved territorial disputes military confrontations and anti piracy operations but also the desire to project military power in the service of one interest or another arms build up is emerging as a trend in many parts of the world governments perceive the threats facing their country in different ways and these are key in determining the way armed forces are set up and equipped but the conditions and triggers for strengthening or modernising the military are often different and the changes in level of militarisation on the gmi values vary from country to country and from continent to continent in this 2015 gmi we will seek to analyse some of the current militarisation trends more closely the top 10 among the ten countries with the highest levels of militarisation israel singapore armenia jordan south korea russia cyprus azerbaijan kuwait and greece three are in the middle east two in asia and five in europe in these countries the armed forces are resourced particularly strongly compared to other sectors of society by contrast a number of major states and emerging economies are not found among the gmi top 10 the united states for example is only ranked 29 top 10 countries with the highest levels of militarisation although it clearly has the world s biggest defense budget and a very large army the resources allocated to the military are relatively moderate in relation to overall public expenditure health spending and population size be that as it may the united states accounted for 34 per cent of worldwide military expenditure in 2014 having spent us 610 billion on the one hand this share has been falling over recent years and may shrink further in the course of the us administration s austerity measures so we could see successive changes in the level of militarisation for the united states moreover the army will probably be numerically downsized with the end of us engagement in afghanistan and iraq on the other none of this will alter the country s overall global military supremacy indeed much of the attempted consolidation especially in the army is part of restructuring and modernisation to improve capability in future missions regional armament in focus middle east the middle east remains a region in which most countries are highly militarised israel is again ranked above all other countries position 1 a level of militarisation that is partly explained by its decades long conflict with the palestinians and the efforts by a number of arab countries to build up their military capability that are regarded by the israeli government as a serious threat the resources available to the military are disproportionately high by international comparison israel s military expenditure last year amounted to 5 2 per cent of gdp a considerable economic burden on the country and against the background of the country s security environment israel has a system of compulsory military service in which most israelis are required to serve for three years this enables the government to draw on a very large military reserve now numbering 465 000 soldiers in the event of war for every 1 000 inhabitants in israel there are 22 9 soldiers and paramilitaries which is a very high ratio for comparison germany 2 3 and only 3 1 physicians 2012 data the 2015 gmi lists jordan in fourth place in terms of numbers jordan has 17 9 soldiers and paramilitaries but only 2 5 physicians for every 1 000 inhabitants 2010 data the country s high level of militarisation is partly explained by the israel palestine conflict jordan s security environment has become increasingly precarious in recent years not least due to the upheavals in north africa the impact of the syrian civil war and the regional threat posed by the socalled islamic state these developments may drive further militarisation similar factors apply to kuwait position 9 where there are 6 7 soldiers and paramilitaries per 1 000 inhabitants but only 1 5 physicians the multiple and complex conflicts occurring across the region are a key factor behind the build up and modernisation of armed forces in which a number of states are investing their considerable oil wealth financial reserves accumulated in the years of high oil prices are being used to equip armies with the latest warplanes and weapon systems not least missile defense systems even though the currently low price of oil has significantly reduced the revenue flows to many governments in the region it is having little impact on military expenditure defense budgets remain high for the time being as financial reserves are used to make up the loss in revenues if and this is seen as likely defense spending continues to rise over the next few years there will probably be cuts in the financial resources available to other sectors of society saudi arabia position 17 is a case in point the level of militarisation by the gulf monarchy is probably connected with its enhanced engagement in the region as seen most notably in the recent military intervention in yemen and operations against socalled islamic state is saudi military expenditures are rising standing at 10 4 per cent of gdp in 2014 even though the government s revenues are waning procurement of modern weapon systems remains at a high level whereas the share of gdp spent on health has been shrinking in recent years 2013 2 per cent a strong focus of arms spending is air force modernisation with combat and tanker aircraft being purchased to improve the kingdom s operational radius a similar case is qatar 2013 position 57 although there are no figures available for 2014 the emirate is likely to show rising levels of militarisation in future after its announcement in 2014 of a us 24 billion investment in modern weapon systems this pushes up military spending sharply taking a larger proportion of gdp than ever before and a shifting the ratio between heavy weapon systems and population size bahrain position 15 kuwait 9 and oman 13 countries with a relatively high level of militarisation are also having to contend with a low oil price in kuwait around 91 per cent of government revenues are generated from oil sales although firm evidence of rising military spending in the form of specific arms procurements is not yet available the conflict in yemen may be driving militarisation especially in oman top 10 countries in the middle east sub saharan africa the index records militarisation in most of sub saharan africa at quite a low level apart from angola the region s highest ranking country position 31 the exceptions include mauretania position 41 chad position 42 and namibia position 44 angola has traditionally maintained a large army having gone through a long civil war its armed forces occupy a strong position within state and society and exercise a great deal of influence the government which has enjoyed high revenues from oil sales over the years is making large investments in modernising the armed forces which explains the high level of militarisation in particular angola has procured new aircraft and helicopters from russia as well as from brazil the czech republic and the united states additional air power is intended to secure the borders and control coastal waters military expenditures as a proportion of gross domestic product now comes to 5 2 per cent a rise of 1 7 per cent since 2011 while health spending amounts to just 2 5 per cent of gdp a rise of only 0 3 per cent as for personnel numbers the latest available figures are from in 2009 and show just 0 1 physicians but 5 5 soldiers and paramilitaries for every 1 000 inhabitants not only procurement of weapon systems but also their maintenance and operation is expensive binding additional resources over long periods resources badly needed in other fields in a country of widespread poverty over 50 per cent of angolans still live on less than two us dollars a day nigeria militarily the strongest country in west africa has by contrast a low gmi ranking position 138 this is because nigeria spends just 0 4 per cent of gdp on the military and for every 1 000 inhabitants there are 0 9 soldiers and 0 3 physicians in view of the country s numerous internal conflicts such a low level of militarisation appears surprising after all a violent conflict has plagued the niger delta for many years growing piracy in the gulf of guinea threatens the whole region and the boko haram terrorist group is creating mayhem in the north of the country yet nigeria invests relatively little in its armed forces the country is however engaged in large scale naval procurements as a response to the threats in the south and is equipping the army with new armoured vehicles for the fight against boko haram this may be reflected in a higher gmi level in future years militarisation in europe a large number of countries in europe show an average level of militarisation although their gmi rating could change in the future europe s most militarised countries two european counties have strikingly high levels of militarisation armenia position 3 and azerbaijan position 8 against the background of the ongoing nagorno karabakh conflict both countries are still investing their resources to an inordinate degree in expanding and modernising their armed forces the same can be said of greece and cyprus still ranking high in the gmi a key factor here is probably the enduring perceptions of a threat posed by turkey even the leftist syriza government has apparently not fundamentally called this view into question although greece has been forced to make major cuts in its defense budget over the last few years the numbers show that there are still 13 5 soldiers and paramilitaries per 1 000 inhabitants in contrast the figure for physicians came to just 4 3 moreover greece has around 1 350 heavy battle tanks constituting by far the biggest fleet of tanks in europe western europe whereas in the past few years military spending was cut back in western europe in particular in the course of austerity measures to shore up hard hit public finances new tensions especially the war in ukraine have become a driver for a future upturn in defense spending thus spending on military procurements and equipment by european nato states fell between 2010 and 2014 by around us 14 billion but nato estimates suggest there will be a significant rise in 2015 the organisation aims at an increase of military budgets to two per cent of the gdp this change of direction will impact over the medium and long term on militarisation levels if bigger procurements really are made and heavy weapon arsenals are restocked in western europe france position 59 the netherlands position 101 norway position 38 sweden position 100 and germany position 97 for example have pledged to raise defense expenditures year by year in the future in the case of germany a strong economy means that increases in defense spending are likely to be accompanied only by a very slight change in the military share of gdp which currently stands at about 1 2 per cent the military expenditures of most western european states with the exception of france 2 2 per cent and greece 2 2 per cent account for less than two per cent of their respective gdp top 10 countries in europe eastern europe a number of eastern european states have also announced plans to boost military spending after years of cut backs the czech republic position 111 wants to increase military expenditures from the current 1 per cent share of gdp to 1 4 per cent by 2020 lithuania position 63 is committed to reaching the target of 2 per cent called for by nato within the same timeframe romania position 34 and bulgaria position 28 are planning similar increases in the years to come the question of what financial scope exists for actually putting desired increases into practice remains open it is not yet clear whether and how far the level of militarisation of european states will change for one thing the process of downsizing armies means fewer soldiers in service moves to abolish or suspend conscription as occurred in germany and sweden mean fewer reservists will be available in the medium to long term by contrast lithuania announced in february 2015 that compulsory military service revoked back in 2008 will be reintroduced initially for the next five years this will alter the gmi parameters russia has moved down one position on the previous year and is now ranked 6th russian military expenditures for 2014 totalled us 84 46 billion which constitutes a 4 5 per cent share of gross domestic product the number of military personnel in service including those in paramilitary formations amounted to 1 260 000 and russia also has two million reservists it is the numerically large forces combined with large numbers of heavy weapon systems that explain russia s high ranking in the gmi well ahead of say the united states or china in the wake of the 2008 war in georgia which exposed the shortcomings of the russian army russia launched a reform process in the armed forces with a strong focus on modernisation smaller more professional and more mobile units are to increasingly replace the massed ranks of conscripts further steps are to be taken to strengthen special operations capabilities russian weapon systems are also being upgraded key elements in this modernisation are likely to be air force improvements new precision weapons and automatic command systems as russia seeks to at least narrow the gap with the military development in the united states looking to the future we will probably see russia following a similar pattern as that of the united states and china of reducing troop numbers it does not signal a reduced role for the military but rather a modernised army just how far the conflict with ukraine and the resulting deterioration of relations with nato will affect the level of militarisation in russia can for the time being only be a matter of speculation we may however assume that russia will at least continue if not strengthen its efforts to modernise the armed forces the ranking of ukraine in the gmi has shifted only a little from 24 in 2013 to 22 in 2014 but it is too soon to tell how far the present conflict will have an impact on the country s level of militarisation over the longer term militarisation in asia china the leading military power in asia is ranked 87th in the 2015 gmi china s considerable growth in military spending us 216 billion according to sipri second only to the united states has gone hand in hand with the country s continuous economic growth economic expansion explains why military expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product comes to only around 2 per cent despite growing in absolute terms over many years as for spending on health this stood at 3 1 per cent of gdp in 2013 an increase of around 0 2 per cent since 2010 the chinese leadership has recently announced plans to downsize the armed forces by 300 000 by the end of 2017 which will leave around 1 9 million soldiers in service this will affect the level of militarisation and free up resources over the medium to longterm however it is also likely savings will then be invested in developing and procuring modern weapon systems for the chinese air force and navy as part of the ongoing modernisation modernisation costs together with investment in military research and development will probably entail a further expansion of china s defense budget singapore a country that ranks in second place in the gmi list has one of the most powerful armed forces in the region despite its small size singapore maintains state of the art weapon systems in large numbers and a large army most neighbouring countries with the exception of china and india have come to regard singapore s military as qualitatively and quantitatively superior military expenditures are 3 3 per cent of gdp representing a very high share in regional comparison in view of singapore s relatively small population its armed forces could be regarded as numerically oversized since there are as many as 27 3 soldiers but only 1 6 physicians for every 1 000 inhabitants the magnitude of the country s forces and their equipment must be understood in connection with the strategy of total defense pursued by the political and military leadership since the 1980s top 10 countries in asia in south korea which ranks 5th in the gmi the conflict with north korea is the critical factor behind its military doctrine and the alignment of its armed forces despite the recent diplomatic overtures the two countries are still officially at war south korea has a comparatively large army with 659 500 soldiers and paramilitaries this breaks down to 13 1 for every 1 000 inhabitants compared to only 2 physicians defense expenditures amount to us 36 7 billion which is a 2 6 per cent share of gdp the border between north and south korea is one of the most highly militarised zones in the world interestingly the south korean defense doctrine also assumes a tous azumuts threat scenario envisaging potential attacks from japan or china in the event of korean reunification militarisation and human development the gmi tells us about the resources devoted to a state s armed forces showing which countries have particularly high or low levels of militarisation the use of major resources for military purposes does not automatically mean a loss of economic potential it is also possible for public expenditures on the military or the mobilisation of previously unused labour to act as an economic stimulus providing soldiers with a regular income generates purchasing power while infrastructure investments for military purposes may also benefit the wider population yet funding for the armed forces ties down resources that could be invested in more productive sectors of society and the economy such as education health and sustainable electricity supplies to explore this relationship we have correlated the gmi with the human development index hdi the latter distinguishes between very high high medium and low human development in each country the following section considers the possible connections between social and economic development measured by the hdi on the one hand and a country s level of militarisation measured by the gmi on the other the correlations presented here do not however automatically suggest causalities a high militarisation and high human development the figures show that highly militarised countries tend to have a high level of human development an obvious reason for this would be that many of these countries have sufficient resources to invest in the military without significantly hampering economic development a clear case in point is israel singapore or the republic of korea these states stand at the top of the gmi but also belong to the group of countries with a very high hdi gmi in relation to hdi b low militarisation and low human development at the other end of the spectrum we find states such as liberia gambia or sierra leone which display both a low level of militarisation and a low level of human development take the case of liberia and sierra leone which have both emerged from civil wars and rank in positions 149 and 146 respectively both countries have significantly cut back on their armed forces as a post conflict environment and are to some extent still involved in a restructuring process they have hardly any heavy weapon systems and spend only 0 8 and 0 6 per cent respectively of gross domestic product on the military by comparison health spending in liberia amounted to 3 6 per cent of gdp in 2013 and in sierra leone even as much as 1 7 per cent so this poses the question of how low levels of militarisation might affect society in terms of human development a very low level of militarisation can be an indication of fundamental shortcomings in the security apparatus that prevent the emergence of a secure and stable environment needed for economic development while there can hardly be a purely military solution to the multiple and complex conflicts across west africa it is also true that conflicts cannot be effectively contained by weak or even dysfunctional armed forces in this situation a low level of militarisation has negative consequences for human development conversely however the low level of human development may indicate that a country has very meagre resources overall and therefore has very little to invest in its armed forces but again this is not necessarily the case c high militarisation and low human development in some countries such as angola chad and mauritania we can observe a relatively high level of militarisation position 31 42 and 41 respectively in the gmi accompanied by low human development here the relationship between militarisation and human development may entail disproportionally high spending on the armed forces draining resources that are vital for development d low militarisation and high human development there are some interesting examples that show it is possible to keep militarisation at a low level while achieving a comparatively high level of human development iceland malta and to a lesser extent albania are such cases in the gmi they are ranked in positions 143 malta 144 albania and 151 iceland placing them among the world s least militarised countries yet at the same time they enjoy high or even very high human development map overview gmi ranking worldwide source conflict data ucdp prio armed conflict dataset sources of administrative boundaries natural earth dataset the depiction and

under the direct control of the government in addition to being armed uniformed and garrisoned syria was also ranked among this group of countries in recent years but the civil war has made it impossible to draw on reliable data about resources going to government forces we may however assume that with the syrian regime mobilising extensive resources the level of militarisation in syria is very high and will have again risen as the war unfolds in the case of north korea and eritrea very high levels of militarisation can also be assumed no valid data is available for either country figures on military expenditure by individual countries are based on data from the stockholm international peace research institute sipri germany has reduced its stocks of heavy battle tanks over the last 25 years by around 2 000 units at present some 225 heavy battle tanks are in active service although the bundeswehr plans to increase this number slightly in view of the latest developments in europe although north korea is likely to have a very high level of militarisation no valid data is available
open this photo in gallery in april 2009 that bank of canada governor mark carney chopped interest rates for the final time taking them as low as they could go within a hair of zero sean kilpatrick the canadian press canada marks a significant anniversary this year even if it s not one that is going to be celebrated with cakes and fireworks it was 10 years ago in april 2009 that bank of canada governor mark carney chopped interest rates for the final time taking them as low as they could go within a hair of zero he framed his decision as an emergency act a temporary measure designed to meet the needs of an economy caught up in a global financial crisis unemployment was rising quickly on its way to nearly 9 per cent what is remarkable is how little interest rates have budged since then in the intervening years the canadian economy has bounced back from its crisis era layoffs with the unemployment rate now at 5 8 per cent near a half century low however the central bank s key interest rate has only inched up slightly to all of 1 75 per cent a rate that before the crisis would have seemed remarkably low this was not the way things were supposed to work policy makers expected a far quicker far more vigorous rebound in interest rates that would take us back to normal in short order but canada and the rest of the globe are discovering an inconvenient truth once you enter the world of low interest rates it is awfully difficult to leave is this a good thing for home buyers yes they have benefited for years from unusually low borrowing costs on their mortgages stocks too have received a boost as microscopic yields on bonds and savings accounts have driven many savers into the equity markets however for anybody who would like to see their savings increase in a bank account or for those concerned about the economy as a whole the past decade raises some disturbing questions about the unintended side effects of easy money consider for instance the way that debt has soared in response to lower borrowing costs canadians have continued their borrowing binge in recent years sending household and corporate debt to record levels as a percentage of the overall economy residents of other countries have also gone deeply into hock so too have companies and governments across both the developed and emerging markets bank of canada senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins noted this month that global debt is now us 100 trillion higher than just before the financial crisis yes that is trillion with a t you don t have to be a central banker to worry about the financial fragility that goes along with that unprecedented level of financial leverage whether you are a homeowner or a businessperson you know first hand that high leverage can leave you in a vulnerable financial position ms wilkins said it s no different for economies it s not just the amount of debt that has people worried it s also what happens when the global economy hits its next downturn as it inevitably will central banks typically slash interest rates by four to five percentage points in recessions to help restart the economy but if rates stay as low as they are now monetary policy makers won t be able to offer much help any attempt to severely lower rates would quickly run them down to zero at which point it would become difficult to lower rates much further canada is just one of many countries facing this constraint should a recession arrive the u s federal reserve would ideally be able to cut interest rates by five percentage points as is customary in such situations brad delong an economist at the university of california at berkeley wrote this month but with short term safe interest rates currently at 2 4 per cent it cannot and with euro and yen interest rates still around zero the european central bank and the bank of japan would be unable to help much either why haven t central banks raised rates more aggressively in good times to give themselves more room to cut in a downturn the answer is they have tried but without success japan is the purest example of the problem this year marks the 20th anniversary of its zero rate policy over the past two decades it has attempted to raise rates on several occasions but always runs into resistance from a faltering economy north american central banks are now bumping up against the same resistance this past fall bank of canada governor stephen poloz and federal reserve chair jerome powell were both signalling higher rates ahead they seemed at long last to be making a clean break from the unusually low rates that had prevailed since the financial crisis then as stock markets swooned late in the year and evidence grew of a global slowdown both central bankers had to perform an about face they reeled back their talk of rate hikes and pledged to be patient and wait for new data before making any further move maybe their retreat was just a temporary halt the result of concerns over brexit and china u s trade tensions however it is legitimate to wonder whether the economy is now hooked on low rates to the point where withdrawing from them would be too painful to contemplate raising rates too far might mean falling home prices crumbling stock prices a slowing or contracting economy the build up of all that debt may have made the economy exquisitely sensitive to any attempt to raise rates if so the current era of low rates could last a long long time the bond market certainly thinks so the yield on the 10 year government of canada bond has tumbled in recent months and hit its lowest point since mid 2017 this past week at 1 53 per cent just a hair above the yield on two year bonds that suggests investors think we are unlikely to see any substantial rise in interest rates and therefore bond yields for the foreseeable future if bond buyers figured rates were set to climb sharply in coming years they would be demanding much more of a premium to tie up their money for a decade other market indicators agree that rates aren t going up any time soon in the united states the yield on three month government bonds moved higher than the 10 year yield earlier this month signalling that more rate cuts may be on the way the futures markets are betting that both the bank of canada and the federal reserve will cut rates at least once this year on friday white house economic adviser larry kudlow told news outlet axios that he wanted to see the fed cut rates immediately by half a percentage point the idea that rates could resume their downward course after years of already low rates does not jibe easily with textbook explanations of how the economy works by now many observers are beginning to wonder how well we understand the levers of the financial system stunning is how justin wolfers an economist at the university of michigan described the most recent set of federal reserve forecasts it would have seemed almost unthinkable a decade ago he noted for a central bank to predict exceptionally low unemployment but with no inflationary pressure and with interest rates below 3 per cent one of the biggest question marks in the current debate is the phillips curve a time honoured notion that insists there is a trade off between unemployment and inflation open this photo in gallery this past fall federal reserve chair jerome powell signalled higher rates ahead jonathan ernst reuters the phillips curve provides the standard explanation for why central banks do what they do by lowering rates in times of slow economic growth policy makers supposedly boost borrowing and goose business activity this leads to more jobs and a more vibrant economy which then spurs higher inflation and ultimately a return to more normal interest rates all this sounds great on paper however the phillips curve has been missing in action since the financial crisis yes rates have gone down and unemployment has dived in both canada and the united states however inflation has only flickered modestly upward and economic growth has remained mostly mediocre as a result there has been little pressure to bump up interest rates could it be that we don t know as much as we thought we did about how modern economies work stephen williamson a professor of central banking at the university of western ontario notes that it has always been difficult to see any type of stable reliable phillips curve in real world data yes countries with higher nominal interest rates tend to have higher inflation but it s not clear which causes which people at central banks find a useful way to explain what they re doing even if it s not actually theoretically or empirically useful prof williamson said in an interview his comments point to the lack of consensus about the best path forward while prof williamson dismisses the phillips curve other experts such as harvard professor kenneth rogoff are willing to double down on the power of lower interest rates he argues that much lower rates negative rates in fact are going to be required if the economy takes a serious stumble this is not just a theoretical debate the stockpile of global bonds with below zero yields has hit us 10 trillion according to bloomberg data in at least 18 countries mostly in europe investors receive negative yields on at least some government bonds meaning that buyers of these securities are paying for the privilege of saving it s entirely possible that negative rates could come to north america as well if a severe recession were to hit but whether that would be a good idea hinges on what is ultimately driving the trend toward lower rates one of the more intriguing views comes from larry summers the harvard economist and former u s treasury secretary he presented a paper earlier this month written with bank of england economist lukasz rachel in which he developed his argument that the developed world is suffering from secular stagnation a long term slowdown in economic growth in mr summers view demographics are one of the major reasons for this slowdown people are living longer enjoying extended retirements and having fewer children as labour force growth slows so does growth in consumer demand yet longer lifespans and longer retirements mean people are trying to save more than ever the result a glut of savings is overwhelming the ability of the private sector to put those savings to productive use in other words there s a lot of capital available but not enough demand from businesses to invest it all since the supply of money is ample but the demand for it is weak the cost of borrowing money goes down this process has been going on for a generation but has become particularly noticeable over the past decade as things now stand we have entered an era of extremely low interest rates weak demand and low growth and inflation mr summers writes just like japan his preferred prescription is for governments to spend more aggressively running up deficits that can usefully absorb some of that pile of savings in addition he suggests looking for ways to reduce the need for people to save perhaps by offering them more in the way of government paid retirement benefits as you might imagine his proposals aren t universally loved especially by people who object to the potential explosion in government debt but the mere fact that such ideas are being discussed a decade after we hit an interest rate bottom underlines how unusual this economic environment has been canada and the world still have a long way to go to reach anything that looks like normalcy

istock com welcome to the last trading day of the quarter and what a quarter it s been we ve seen quite a turnaround after the market tanked late last year on worries about global economic growth stemming from the u s china trade war and concerns about a potentially too aggressive fed one leg of the market s recovery this quarter has come from increasing optimism that the u s and china can get a deal done to normalize trade relations affecting billions of dollars of goods flowing around the globe that optimism extended into this morning after treasury secretary steven mnuchin tweeted that talks in beijing had been constructive the other major leg of support has been a fed that has adopted a decidedly dovish stance helping boost the s p 500 by more than 12 this year through thursday s close one reason the central bank has given for holding off on more rate hikes has been muted inflation the latest inflation data from this morning showed the core personal consumption expenditures price index which strips out volatile food and energy prices and is the fed s preferred measure of inflation increased 0 1 month over month in january that s a lower reading than a briefing com consensus expectation of 0 2 and continues to reinforce what the fed has been saying about muted inflation meanwhile ride hailing service lyft is hitting public trading this morning beating its rival uber to an initial public offering the company now valued at about 24 billion has priced its shares at the top of its range at 72 per share shares will trade on the nasdaq under the ticker lyft in other corporate news carmax shares were up more than 5 8 this morning after the used car retailer s earnings beat expectations revenue was below analyst estimates optimism on trade after taking a back seat recently the optimism on the trade front was rekindled on thursday as mnuchin and u s trade representative robert lighthizer were in beijing for a fresh round of talks between the world s two largest economies reuters reported that china has made unprecedented proposals on issues including forced technology transfer but that there wasn t a definite timetable for a deal another round of negotiations is scheduled for next week in washington this continues a pattern we ve been seeing where drips of seemingly good news come out and the market reacts positively but continues to be in the dark about the exact nature of where the negotiations are at and what key issues are getting hammered out president trump has already extended a deadline that could have seen the u s increase tariffs on chinese goods and it remains to be seen how much longer the talks will drag on it s possible that investor fatigue about the trade issue has set in limiting thursday s gains pessimism on the economy but it also appears that worries about the economy probably put a cap on any upside for wall street yesterday as well even as the fed has adopted a dovish stance and european central bankers have also stood pat on interest rates keeping relatively easy money flowing to companies monetary policy makers on both sides of the atlantic ocean have also reduced their economic forecasts in line with the sobering assessments the u s government on thursday said the economy expanded less than previously thought in the final quarter of last year with its third estimate of q4 gdp showing an annualized rate of increase of 2 2 compared with a previous reading of 2 6 a briefing com consensus had expected a reading of 2 5 inversion in the yield curve the worry about economic growth has been tempering some of the enthusiasm on wall street recently with the recent concerns coming from the u s treasury market as investors don t expect an interest rate hike from the fed anytime soon and indeed have been increasing their bets in the futures markets of a rate decrease the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury has fallen below that of the 3 month treasury this atypical pattern hasn t happened for the 3 month 10 year spread since 2007 and often precedes recessions but it s not a sure bet just because we re seeing an inversion doesn t necessarily mean we re headed into a recession recessions do happen as a natural part of the business cycle but an inversion doesn t mean one is imminent and investors did get some respite thursday as the yield on the 10 year treasury rose a bit even though it didn t pop above the 3 month yield the rise in the 10 year yield and the optimism about the trade situation seemed to outweigh the worries about the yield curve inversion and the dismal

cashing in on charter schools part five advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that new jersey charter schools acquire and finance buildings a shortsighted law a lack of funding and inadequate oversight have left new jersey s charter schools to find their own way when it comes to filling a basic need finding a home the result is a system that allows charter school operators to use public money to pay for buildings that are privately owned it can push charter schools and the support groups that own and finance real estate on their behalf into unusual and costly building deals leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab it s a system in which financial transactions often play out behind a wall of secrecy away from the public eye and beyond the reach of open records laws more than 20 years after the first charter schools opened in new jersey many still struggle with finding and funding a facility for their students and experts say change is long overdue bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing said the absence of a clear path for charter schools to obtain funding for buildings has left the door open for this to go haywire and get kind of creative and out of control over time now s the time to rein it in he said clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient in many cases private companies are created to own the real estate and the rent they collect from charter schools money that comes from taxpayers is used to repay the debt on the buildings hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid is going to some of the largest charter operators to construct or renovate buildings that are used by charter schools but are privately owned in interviews and emails advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that charter schools acquire and finance buildings including loosening restrictions on spending and increasing public funding and transparency bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing now s the time to rein it in clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient quote icon their suggestions include providing funding for charter schools that is earmarked for facilities closing the funding gap between traditional districts and charters removing a provision in the state s charter school law that bars charters from using state and local money to construct new buildings ensuring that publicly funded charter school buildings are owned by the public at least once the debt on the building is repaid improving coordination between charter and traditional public schools on facilities and requiring that surplus or underused space in district schools be offered to charter schools first creating an authority that would issue bonds to finance publicly owned facilities for both charter schools and traditional districts requiring state officials to review lease and finance agreements before they are signed improving oversight of charter school building projects looking into whether the state should provide direct loans or loan guarantees to charter schools requiring private companies that are created to support charter schools in real estate transactions to be transparent and to open their books to show how they are spending public money this is public money and this is a major issue said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent it s not an easy fix public policy in this area has been lacking for two decades the administration of gov phil murphy is only now reviewing the law something that was required to be done within five years of its passage preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut this is public money and this is a major issue there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent quote icon and there are plenty of complications charter schools are publicly funded but operate independently of local school districts they have their own boards and make their own decisions supporters of charter schools say they provide opportunities for choice and innovation and should be better supported noting that more than 35 000 students are on waiting lists for seats statewide there are many who believe more autonomy and flexibility and less regulation is in keeping with the core principles of running a charter school yet there is tension between charter schools and regular public districts critics say charters undermine public education by draining cash and pupils from traditional public schools ensuring resistance from teachers unions and districts on any proposed funding hikes for charters or requirements for shared space the state education department meanwhile has limited ability to oversee charter schools its charter school office has a staff of five and has had high turnover in its leadership there have been six directors in the last decade since the private companies created by charter operators do not have to show their records it s unclear how they would react to a requirement to share information and how it would be enforced a lack of transparency even though charter schools ultimately supply the money that pays for building projects in many cases they do not possess documents related to the financing and construction of their facilities while a few charter schools were able to provide information from a support group others including the state s largest team academy and north star academy said they had no information about the debt on the buildings they use debt that is covered by the rents the schools pay to their private partners in a few instances members of charter school boards said they had been unable to get information about real estate owned by their own support groups dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield said she hit a dead end when she tried to research costs on a building owned by the school s support group and never got answers from the company that managed the school i was never privy to the original note armstrong said of the financing what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information team academy charter school in newark which is run by kipp new jersey provided this response when asked about the debt on buildings it rents from support groups your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield i was never privy to the original note what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information quote icon newark s north star academy operated by uncommon schools responded similarly since the school is not a party to the loan documents we do not have records responsive to the debt service portion of this request officials said the marion p thomas charter school also in newark said it didn t have records related to one of its support groups that holds real estate a group that an official there said has an office in one of its school buildings private groups tied to charter schools many of them created solely to hold real estate also declined to provide records related to projects and their financing saying they are not subject to public records laws in many cases both the schools and their support groups declined to discuss details of financial transactions related to construction projects joseph v doria jr a former state senator who was a sponsor of the 1996 law that created charter schools in new jersey and is the dean of the caulfield school of education at st peter s university is seen in his jersey city office kevin r wexler northjersey com the state education department said it does not have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed and that it doesn t oversee private related companies i disagree i think they have the authority because they re using public money said joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law if they feel they don t have the authority just introduce legislation national experts too believe agencies that authorize and oversee charter schools can and should be looking at private groups and their financial dealings i believe a quality authorizer has the ability to intervene and protect the school and the taxpayers from groups entering into related party transactions that aren t in the best interests of students and taxpayers said james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute kipp new jersey s team academy charter school in newark in a statement your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school quote icon the dearth of public information means for example that taxpayers can t see why the friends of team academy which supports the newark charter school has earned millions of dollars in development fees or how that money is spent taxpayers won t know why uncommon schools donated millions to north star academy but then required that the money be spent on a building owned by a related company taxpayers can t see the agreement that the friends of marion p thomas charter school signed with a developer that had the friends pay out 6 4 million in fees as part of a two building deal the group s attorney would not provide it and the charter school said it did not have a copy and the public won t know precisely how the nonprofit groups that own real estate and rent it to charter schools in camden and paterson spend the money they receive in rent that is over and above what is needed to cover the debt on the buildings we remind you that the network is not a public entity and therefore is not subject to public disclosure requirement but we encourage you to follow up with any relevant charter school in order to obtain the documents you seek the executive director of camden s charter network said in a letter to reporters complex financial details are hidden the public also has no way of knowing the financial details of one of the largest charter school construction projects in the state such as the interest rates on some loans or the debt on the building uncommon schools recently completed an ambitious 69 million project in newark opening a six story building at the start of this school year that was funded with a construction loan and millions of dollars in federal bonds and tax credits a real estate entrepreneur made millions of dollars buying the property and flipping it in a little more than a year to the charter school operator a bank is claiming millions in federal tax credits the federal government is chipping in tens of millions more in school construction aid while state and local taxpayers are paying 3 million a year in rent to repay loans but many of the details of the transaction are not publicly available and uncommon schools has declined to discuss them the building is owned by a private company that was created to hold the property and rent it to the public charter school north star academy adding to the lack of transparency is the number of companies involved in transactions by the largest charter operators uncommon schools spokeswoman barbara martinez in a statement north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark quote icon for example kipp new jersey uses more than a half dozen companies with roles in multiple financial transactions and uncommon schools has at least two dozen companies that have been involved in real estate and in the financing of projects in newark some created for a single transaction six of these called uncommon lenders primarily lend money seven others called uncommon properties borrow the money another 11 companies have been involved in property transactions most of them own or lease buildings uncommon schools and north star said in a statement that because charter schools don t have the same access to facilities or opportunities for financing as district schools they are forced to work with the capital markets to find facilities and financing all of which happens with more complexity than for district schools north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark uncommon s spokeswoman barbara martinez wrote in the statement the programs she added lowered the cost of the school s building projects james goenner of the national charter schools institute you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open quote icon some charter operators sought to distance their schools from the groups that own the buildings they use and participate in facilities financing although these entities may be affiliated with team academy charter school they are neither created nor controlled by it nor related to it for federal income tax purposes or accounting purposes one lawyer wrote in response to a request for records the school does not control the manner in which these entities operate or perform the school s board does not appoint members or trustees of any entities north star academy declined to disclose information about the debt on its buildings or to provide financial documents for companies that are subsidiaries of uncommon schools which runs the school it wrote that those companies are separate entities from north star that are not under north star s control goenner of the national charter schools institute said nothing prevents the private groups from being more open you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open the state requires charter schools to submit copies of leases and mortgages annually but only for new locations officials said they look to ensure that the length of the lease doesn t exceed the length of the school s charter and that the actual rent is in line with the amount set aside for that purpose in the school s budget college achieve s westervelt avenue building in north plainfield includes a former catholic school building and an addition abbott koloff northjersey com but the state accepted leases that schools signed with one nonprofit management company college achieve public charter schools that did not include the amount they were paying in rent that figure could be calculated only with information in the master lease the contract between the management company and the property owner the state said it does not collect master leases moreover charter schools that college achieve is paid to operate did not always have key details related to their facilities one could not provide a rent schedule or the project cost for its north plainfield location a refurbished and expanded catholic school it subleases from the management company the paterson school meanwhile could show what it pays to college achieve but had no document showing what the management company now pays to lease the building from a third party many of the documents that northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey were initially able to obtain under the state s open public records law required the intervention of an attorney those documents indicate that the management company and not the charter school holds the purchase option on at least two buildings dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities quote icon law leads to private ownership some say the charter school law and regulations have pushed the schools away from building ownership and toward renting from commercial landlords or creating separate companies to own real estate the schools are prohibited from having long term debt that exceeds the value of their property and from entering loans that allow lenders to go after assets other than real estate if they default and they can t use state or local dollars to build a school a provision some say hamstrings charters and leads to confusion over what is permitted that rule has been clarified to say charter schools can t use public money to erect a completely new building allowing for the funding of additions and renovations dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country said it s not a smart law james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind quote icon different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work berg said to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities the groups that hold property for charter schools obtain loans based on a school s public revenues and leases showing how the debt will be covered yet charter school experts said lenders have shown a preference for financing school construction projects through private entities instead of the public charter schools i believe this is just a feeling of the lenders that here s a charter school which can be closed at any time said rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association lenders he said figure that nonprofit groups would continue to operate after the school closes though they would have no income of their own rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association tariq zehawi northjersey com without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building pressler said patrick beausoleil vice president of portfolio development at highmark schools development in utah said the presence of a friends group in a transaction is a perceived comfort for lenders but one that is illusory it s largely a legal comfort level in that if the school did dry up and blow away technically there is recourse with the friends said beausoleil whose firm has developed charter school facilities in new jersey and elsewhere in the country and we all know if the school dries up and blows away it doesn t matter how many layers of others are in the mix if the revenue stream is gone we ve got an empty building and we need another tenant fewer than 20 of new jersey s 88 charter schools own at least one of their buildings directly most rent from private landlords including commercial developers and private nonprofit groups many of which were created to help the charter schools state sen ronald l rice we argue that if they are public schools we should own that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers quote icon many of the leases reviewed for this series require the charter schools to pay all expenses related to the buildings including taxes maintenance and repairs they are known as triple net leases goenner said it is not necessarily the best use of taxpayers money when schools invest heavily in a building that somebody else owns in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind goenner said private ownership of public charter school buildings has struck a nerve particularly in newark where the school district has been selling off buildings state sen ronald l rice said he s concerned about what might happen to privately owned charter school buildings in the city private groups he said could sell them years from now and might want to gut and rehab one building and turn it into luxury condos with a view of the new york city skyline rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building quote icon we argue that if they are public schools we should own the buildings said rice a democrat whose district includes part of newark referring to the public that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers he added team academy charter school recently purchased its first building a former essex county school on 13th street in newark but only because public ownership was a requirement of the sale team s support groups own five other facilities the state issued 12 7 million in tax exempt bonds of which 7 5 million was designated for the purchase and renovations of the building the rest went to renovate other team buildings the loan documents show that the bond proceeds went to the friends of team which planned to lend the school 11 6 million berg the financial adviser who represented the friends in the transaction said public ownership of buildings might become more common if the law is changed my own personal feeling is that owning is probably better in the long run for the school and therefore for the public good he said in the long run real estate is probably going up not down in price he added and schools that own their own buildings wouldn t be subject to increasing rents finding a fix experts say solutions lie in fair funding shared resources and public policy that makes clear how charter schools are supposed to obtain and pay for buildings charter school advocates want access to unused school district buildings and designated funding for facilities i think the best solution is to fund charter schools the way we fund all public schools and then we get rid of the problem entirely pressler said the situation that we ve created in new jersey by denying charter schools access to all of these facilities funds has led us to try to find ways to get this done we need buildings unlike many other states new jersey has no clear mechanism for charter schools to access buildings owned by public school districts the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it pressler added he said it s unclear how many such buildings are available and many need serious renovation so we re still going to have an issue with how do we bring them up to code if it s an older building since charter schools get no facilities aid from the state every dollar spent on a building comes out of each school s operating budget charters spend an average of 13 percent of their revenues on their buildings according to the national alliance for public charter schools rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it quote icon pressler noted that whenever a traditional public school district needs money to acquire or build a new structure it simply asks voters to pass referenda that generate additional tax revenues that effectively shield their operating budgets from debt payments traditional public schools may get facilities funding from the state for their projects and the state schools development authority funds and manages school construction projects for new jersey s 31 poorest districts it also has provided grants to regular districts pressler acknowledged that in some cases federal money has been attached to bonds that are issued to finance charter school projects but he said state and local taxpayers don t see a rate increase when a charter school constructs or renovates a building if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year he said my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building charter schools on average receive about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the state charter association the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive some schools receive much less for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building quote icon charter school advocates said the funding disparity makes it difficult for some schools to find affordable financing schools and their support groups have taken out interest only loans and are required to pay hefty fees to get out of the agreements once they become financially stable and are able to get a better deal the beloved community charter school in jersey city for example plans to pay such a fee next year if you had the funding formula working the way it was intended to when the charter law was passed that by itself would have enabled a school to directly buy and hold real estate because it could have afforded to pay principal and interest said bret schundler beloved s founder and a former state education commissioner all charter schools in my opinion should get some kind of increment for facility purposes he said an additional 1 500 per pupil would be enough for most charter schools education experts say that some charter school boards are not equipped to navigate real estate transactions leading to costly deals that can drain money from education the friends of marion p thomas charter school paid a 67 percent premium in addition to renovation costs when it exited a lease early and bought two buildings from a developer the group could have purchased them for 6 million but couldn t find financing instead it paid the developer who owned one of the buildings for only two months 16 million green the university of connecticut professor said that avoiding such deals would require a level of sophistication that many charter school boards simply can t muster i think that one of the things that maybe the state could do is to actually educate charter school boards on real estate arrangements as part of the training of what your fiduciary duties are he said new jersey has just one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charter schools goenner advocates for multiple authorizers in each state and ensuring they re adequately staffed nine years ago he directed an authorizing office at central michigan university that had a staff of 30 to oversee 60 michigan charter schools that s six times the staff that oversees new jersey s 88 charter schools twenty states have more than one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charters bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms quote icon the new jersey charter schools association has suggested that the state s law be amended to allow for an independent chartering board as an additional authorizer having multiple authorizers goenner said allows for trying different approaches that lead to continuous improvement and evolution and proper staffing he said is critical because authorizers serve an important check and balance to ensure that the kids are learning and that the taxpayers money is well stewarded baker the rutgers professor said there should be more coordination among school districts and charter schools like pressler he suggested funding charter school facilities like traditional schools with the provision that the buildings are owned by the public he said the state should create some centralized authority that would issue bonds to finance construction of charter school buildings or to make improvements the bonds could be issued by traditional districts with voter approval it would work like other bond debt for public projects he said and taxpayers would pay for it we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters baker said these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms in los angeles for example the city s school district used 600 million in federal school construction bonds to build schools that are owned by the public and used by both traditional and charter schools the district bills the charter schools based on the amount of space they use to cover their share of annual debt payments on the bonds maintenance and other costs including security in contrast new jersey gave most of its share of the federal bonds more than 400 million to the state s two largest charter operators over the past 10 years to fund building projects that are owned by private groups that support the schools baker said moving to a public ownership and public investment model would take care of other problems such as a lack of transparency on the part of some private groups that own charter school buildings i don t know that we can fully imagine all of the types of transactions we would have to identify to regulate them he said the better more efficient way to go about it is just to eliminate entirely all these complex mechanisms students in the cafeteria at the princeton charter school amy newman northjersey com photo illustration jodi miskell usa today network and getty images charters that own their buildings charter schools have become a familiar part of the education landscape yet finding and financing a facility can still be difficult and costly for many of them elements of the law remain a problem and some experts say proper funding assistance in obtaining loans and a clear way to access unused space in the traditional public school districts are lacking academics point to an absence of public policy on the matter as a result most charter schools do not own their buildings this means the public puts money into facilities it does not own and cannot recoup if the property is sold but a smaller number of charter schools have managed to own at least one of their buildings directly here s how they did it the princeton charter school owns its buildings amy newman northjersey com princeton charter school before the princeton charter school opened in 1997 its founders had a lot to contemplate how do you fundraise for a building when you have no school how do you buy one when you have no money how do you build a school when state law says you can t use public funds to construct one peter n yianilos one of the founders said they pondered that chicken and egg problem along with a host of others today the school has a thriving 7 acre campus of 424 students and four buildings one for kindergarten through fourth graders another for fifth through eighth graders and a campus center that opened in 2010 that includes a theater a gymnasium an art studio and music classrooms i m very proud of how this happened yianilos said noting this isn t a school that was built by a single big grant or one wealthy person that simply did it it started with nothing peter n yianilos one of the founders of the princeton charter school the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building quote icon the group s first challenge was a practical one finding usable space within princeton we looked around and we had very few options yianilos recalled the group pinned its hopes on a large tract with two buildings a farmhouse and an office building but the realtor didn t want to talk to them didn t know what a charter school was and wanted a bona fide buyer the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building yianilos recalled the price struck was 2 8 million but like any newly approved charter it had no money just a fast approaching deadline to get the school up and running you have no public funds because the students haven t attended yet yianilos said they talked to banks a lot of them they did some fundraising we didn t have a large down payment yianilos said it s also difficult to fundraise when there is no school he persuaded bankers to agree that if a substantial portion of the loan was guaranteed it would be viewed as equity in the property and the bank would loan against it in all there were 21 guarantors that secured amounts between 10 000 and 50 000 most were in the 20 000 to 25 000 range the bank meanwhile agreed to accept statements from accountants confirming their net worth was sufficient to back whatever portion of the loan they guaranteed their downside was limited and that made it something that people could contemplate doing yianilos said the school borrowed 2 15 million from a bank and another 500 000 from the owner and records show yianilos and three others lent the school another 200 000 money was just one piece of the equation the founders yianilos said were scratching our heads at the time and thinking a lot about who owns the building founders ultimately decided that having the school own the property was a straightforward simple approach to take he said that way tax dollars put into the buildings wouldn t be lost to the public the hope academy charter school purchased its asbury park building which is on grand avenue asbury park press file hope academy in asbury asbury park s hope academy charter school opened in 2001 in a church owned property and as it grew rented more space at another nearby church when it learned that one of the buildings was up for sale it started looking for a new home as a result hope academy landed in a multi story office building on grand avenue its rent began at 144 000 annually with the school responsible for repairs and maintenance as well as a proportionate share of real estate taxes and other building costs the landlord fell into financial trouble and the school was eventually making lease payments to a court appointed rent receiver chief school administrator davisha pratt said the owner was on the verge of losing the building which she described as neglected but alexis crawford the school s founder and retired director said the charter school was not in a position to buy it donna torres hope academy s business administrator we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen quote icon that was always a part of the vision to own the building crawford said in 2011 a non profit called build with purpose intervened agreeing to purchase and renovate the building and lease it to the charter school we bought the property as a service an emergency interim measure and then took out financing to improve the property said brian keenan president of build with purpose the school s new lease started rent at 345 000 annually it could buy the building at any time at a price to be reasonable determined by landlord and tenant it was required to pay a 50 000 purchase option fee and make a 125 000 contribution to building improvements under the lease the landlord picked up roof and structural repairs but the school was responsible for everything else from windows doors and floors to plumbing heating and air conditioning systems we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen said hope academy s business administrator donna torres she added that buying the building would give us stability and then when we did the improvements we d be improving our own building since we were paying for it anyway at the end of 2016 hope academy bought the building for 4 3 million it received a more than 1 million direct loan from the new jersey economic development authority which also issued 3 million in tax exempt bonds for the school s benefit literally they can call it their home pratt said of the students we don t have to worry about being uprooted today hope academy s combined annual payments on those debts are 240 937 nearly 45 percent less than the 435 750 they would have been paying in rent this school year had they continued to lease vincent and magda derosa of lincoln park founded the classical academy charter school of clifton which opened in 1998 they are standing in front of the school s original building which the academy still owns but no longer uses amy newman northjersey com classical academy in clifton vincent derosa a former public school teacher in glen rock had his eye on a nursing home perched on a hill for a new charter school he planned to open in clifton a little more than 20 years ago when he was told the nursing home was moving out he quickly moved to rent it the classical academy charter school opened in 1998 the second year that charter schools could operate in the state the school rented the former nursing home overlooking valley road with an option to purchase it for more than three years it paid 710 000 to purchase the building in 2002 using two separate loans from the same bank the first loan was scheduled to be repaid in five years the second in 15 years there was never any question about whether the school could own its own building derosa said the state was always aware of our actions and it never became any kind of issue he said the second loan was repaid early derosa said and the school owned the building free and clear in 2009 that allowed the small school 120 students in grades 6 through 8 to save on interest payments and put away some of its public revenue derosa said he was able to have the building painted and wire it for computers if you don t have control of your facility and it s in the hands of another party anything can happen derosa said we felt the sooner we paid off the building that would free up money for education costs when derosa retired a few years ago he said the school had 1 million in cash surplus then he said new leadership took over two years ago they moved out of the valley road building and began renting a school building owned by st paul s roman catholic parish the new building has more than 23 000 square feet of space according to the paterson diocese website including a gym cafeteria and library classical academy was approved last month to expand by 60 students 20 per class for a total of 180 for the next school year according to records that the school provided in response to a public records request last year the state rejected the school s first request to expand which was made shortly after it moved state records show that classical academy was scheduled to pay a little more than 260 000 in annual rent in its first two years in its new home it has an option to renew its lease for three years at the end of this school year the head of the school sandra giordano declined to discuss the academy s finances and real estate transactions she did not respond to questions emailed to her about the school s plans derosa said the school took a risk by moving into a new building before it received the state s approval to increase its enrollment the rent over the past two years he said was high for such a small school he followed up in a letter writing that by the end of this school year the academy s administration will have needlessly spent over 500 000 of school money on a lease for a privately owned building when they themselves own a fully paid school building in which for 16 years students had received the best of public school education the move he wrote was a shockingly poor spending decision

a reporter heads for the press center of the boao forum for asia annual conference on march 25 xinhua in the past for residents of boao then a fishing village sitting on an estuary in china s southernmost hainan island the world was a remote inaccessible place on the other side of the raging sea then the boao forum for asia bfa a non profit promoting regional economic integration and globalization was founded in 2001 and subsequently chose boao as the permanent venue for its annual conference it turned into a village of diplomacy where the world descends every year this year when the annual conference themed shared future concerted action common development ran from march 26 to 29 bfa secretary general li baodong outlined the most prominent challenges the world faces today

countries trade policies zhang yuyan director of the institute of world economics and politics under the chinese academy of social sciences considered the u s monetary policy to be an uncertain factor it remains to be seen whether it will adjust its neutral policy which will have a profound impact on the global economy asset and commodity prices and the debts of developing countries he said for hitoshi suzuki a member of the policy board of the bank of japan trade and monetary policies were predictable and controllable through negotiations and the market however the unpredictable technological revolution is where the uncertainty lies suzuki said while one solution to cope with japan s population decline and its ageing is to make full use of artificial intelligence ai robots and automaton it is a hard balancing act if ai is overused it will affect the labor market zhang tao s suggestion was to do the right things first creating right macroeconomic policies conducive to

major role in boosting growth during the past 20 years new technologies and information and communication technology contributed to more than 30 percent of per capita income growth he said he also

participants and common development was their common aspiration li baodong said at a press meeting the recovery of the world economy is based on the dividends of international cooperation so when globalization is impeded and international cooperation does not increase it is hard to generate the dividend and underpin the growth of world economies accelerating integration of asian economies and regional cooperation is the way to tackle the problem according to the asian competitiveness annual report 2019 one of the four reports issued by the bfa in 2018 27 asian economies improved their competitiveness score compared with a year earlier and the gap between different economies narrowed down indicating healthier and more balanced development of asian countries according to the report the prospects of emerging markets and developing economies in asia remain optimistic and they are still one of the major engines underpinning the world economy it said since the fall of 2018 the world economy has taken a downward trend and uncertain factors accumulated nevertheless asia accounted for 60 percent of the world economic growth showcasing huge vitality and potential kent calder director of the edwin o reischauer center for east asian studies washington d c said in addition the e11 the 11 major emerging market economies in the group of 20 registered 5 1 percent growth in 2018 which was basically in line with the optimism the world economy may trend down in 2019 which will spill over to affect the performance of the e11 but as the economic restructuring brings dividends and reforms deepen in emerging market economies the e11 economy is expected to maintain mid to high growth in 2019 and remains an indispensable driving force for global economic expansion according to the development of emerging economies annual report 2019 the third report the progress of asian economic integration annual report 2019 said 17 new free trade agreements were signed during 2017 18 involving at least one asia pacific economy about 70 agreements are currently under negotiation negotiations for the multi member comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership

interdependent the fourth report the asian financial development report on infrastructure finance said insufficient and inefficient infrastructure has become a development bottleneck the belt and road initiative has brought investment for infrastructure construction which has cut trade costs in the countries on the initiative s routes by 3 5 percent indicating the significance of infrastructure construction the surging demand for high quality infrastructure has given rise to projects such as the belt and road initiative and the master plan on asean connectivity 2025 with countries and regions sparing no effort to address infrastructure financing difficulties this will lay a solid foundation for economic integration in asia it said taking into account the complicated situation asia and emerging market economies are facing the four reports have still indicated confidence in economic development and regional cooperation in asia zhang yuyan quoted an old chinese saying cope with shifting events by sticking to a fundamental principle he said given the current context the fundamental principle has several layers of connotation among which international cooperation is the most important one china has been following this principle all along premier li keqiang delivers a keynote speech at the opening plenary of the boao forum for asia annual conference 2019 in the southern island province of hainan on march 28 xinhua the chinese approach as one of the most crucial links in the asian economic integration china has its own wisdom to cope with uncertainties li daokui

development the past 10 years have seen china contribute one fourth to one third of the global growth the experience and lessons accumulated during the 70 years since the founding of the people s republic of china are helping many countries in their development drive gloria macapagal arroyo speaker of the house of representatives the lower house of the congress in the philippines and former president of the island state agreed with li she said china s development has made the world realize that each country can find its own way of development according to its own situation among all the efforts by china to promote integration in asia and globalization the belt and road is a major initiative proposed by china in 2013 it has since gained momentum with countries and regions along the envisioned land and maritime routes joining in the recent signing of a belt and road cooperation memorandum of understanding between china and italy is a new proof of the initiative s popularity china s deepening reform and opening up is also one of the ways to not only benefit china itself but contribute to global development long yongtu former bfa secretary general said long said china should not only introduce capital talent and projects but also growth drivers only by increasing interactions with the outside world and encouraging mutual development can china deepen its own reform and become an innovation driven country innovation was a buzzword at the conference where participants were treated to intelligent vehicle services and ai based simultaneous interpretation regarding concerns over technologies wong kan seng former deputy prime minister of singapore said instead of fearing them people need to embrace them they are no job snatchers but provide more freedom to people to do other things china has demonstrated its innovation in creating new business models such as the sharing economy e commerce and e payment these new innovative growth drivers will not only create advantages for china but generate vitality for the economic development of asia and the rest of the world while experiencing miraculous development china also faces challenges francois hollande former president of france said suggesting china could follow up with new ways to respond to climate change and the problem of an ageing population li daokui said china should also adopt an incentive mechanism to motivate entrepreneurs scientists innovators and government employees to cultivate internal forces for development long emphasized that china has always sought a peaceful environment for development it is an upholder of international order rather than a disruptor there is an old chinese saying that time reveals a man s heart he said time will prove what china s role is in the world

it is possible to be technically correct and still mislead either inadvertently or intentionally that surely has happened with recent reports on the u s trade deficit these counted imports of goods and services some 59 8 billion in excess of exports in december making the trade deficit for all 2018 some 621 billion 12 4 percent deeper than 2017 and the reddest ink ever recorded for a year though lower than a few months in 2007 still for all the superlatives invited by this report a little perspective shows that this deficit is less imposing than it seems and fundamentally much less severe than at times in the past the first point of perspective emerges in the reasons why the trade deficit has widened the u s economy has accelerated overall real economic growth last year amounted to just about 3 percent far faster than the 2 percent a year average during most of the time since the 2009 end of the great recession every major economic sector joined this recent acceleration most notably capital spending by business which grew in real terms 6 7 percent a year in 2017 and 2018 a huge change from the near zero growth average in the two prior years as this faster rate of expansion stepped up demands for both domestic and foreign products imports naturally rose exports might have risen as fast had the economies of america s trading partners also accelerated but as it was these economies slowed the european union eu grew at barely 2 0 percent in 2018 slower than in earlier years china growing at some 6 percent outpaced the united states but still grew slower than in the past canada grew barely 1 5 percent in 2018 japan at about 1 2 percent and mexico at just about 2 0 percent demands for goods and services in these economies whether from domestic sources or american producers simply did not keep up with u s demands alone these different growth rates would have widened the u s trade imbalance but there was more to it improving american economic prospects drew investment monies into the country from abroad flows that raised the foreign exchange value of the dollar over the course of 2017 and 2018 the dollar rose by between 1 5 and 2 5 percent against the euro the canadian dollar the japanese yen the chinese yuan and mexico s peso by making u s products slightly more expensive on global markets and foreign products slightly cheaper this increase in the value of the dollar though modest by currency standards gave foreign products a pricing edge over u s products that attracted american buyers even as it limited foreign appetites for american goods and services the currency moves were not enough to offset the tariffs variously imposed by the white house but they were enough to exaggerate the impact of differential growth rates moreover recent history makes these effects clear when in the 1990s the technology boom among other things propelled the u s economy much faster than others the u s trade deficit widened the excess of imports over exports rose from some 108 billion in 1990 to 420 billion in the opening year of this century a mild recession in 2001 02 briefly staunched american demands for imports allowing a modest improvement in the trade balance but then economic recovery renewed the earlier widening trend by early 2007 just before the financial crisis the gap reached levels not much different from those recorded last year the great recession of 2008 09 cut off demands for imports the trade deficit narrowed by half to 275 billion in 2010 in the recovery over the next six years it began to widen again but only slowly the disappointingly slow pace of america s economic expansion only exceeded foreign growth by a small margin then with the 2017 2018 american economic acceleration the deficit widened more dramatically as described this history also makes clear that today s trade imbalance though greater in dollars than ever before threatens the economy a lot less than lower dollar figures did in the past the commerce department reports that 2018 s red ink amounted to some 3 1 percent of the country s gross domestic product gdp that is well below all but a few years during the last two decades when the trade deficit averaged about 4 percent of gdp it is dramatically better than the 5 6 percent of gdp the trade deficit measured in 2007 true that year s deficit was slightly less in dollar terms than 2018 s but it fell on a smaller economy though the red ink of 2018 is not insignificant it nonetheless clearly threatens the economy and american jobs a lot less than such deficits did in the not too distant past if economic growth in the rest of the world were to accelerate to the pace of the united states the trade deficit would almost certainly narrow the history reviewed here makes that clear alternatively the deficit could narrow if this country s economy were to slow to the paltry rates of expansion exhibited in the rest of the world that might provide bragging rights in the media but it would be a high price to pay for them milton ezrati is a contributing editor at the national interest an affiliate of the center for the study of human capital at the university at

why is turkey fighting the markets published 29 march 2019 share close panel copy link about sharing financial markets in turkey have been volatile in the run up to local elections on sunday the currency the lira dropped 5 in the course of a single day while the stock market lost 10 of its value in just over a week the economy is going through a very difficult patch with a recession accompanied by high inflation turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has suggested the west is behind the financial turbulence how bad is turkey s economic situation it has certainly taken a marked turn for the worse after a long period of mostly strong growth under president erdogan he took office in 2003 as prime minister in the first instance then later as president in the aftermath of a major financial crisis that led to a bailout from the international monetary fund the economy subsequently saw healthy growth apart from 2009 when there was a global recession in the 15 years from when he took power the economy more than doubled in size at an average annual rate of 5 6 now however the economy has shrunk in both the third and fourth quarters of last year that is a recession as the term is most often defined economic activity in the final three months of 2018 was 3 lower than a year earlier unemployment is also a persistent and worsening problem by december last year 4 3 million people wanted a job and didn t have one giving an unemployment rate of 13 5 is a recovery on the cards there may well be a recovery of sorts but it would be quite a surprise if it s as strong as the country s recent performance for the next four years the international monetary fund is predicting a return to growth but it s not expecting much more than 2 5 and less in some years for an emerging economy where the potential for growth should be relatively good that s not particularly impressive what about inflation turkey also has a serious inflation problem consumer prices in february were very nearly 20 higher than a year earlier the figure was more than 25 in october image source getty images central banks generally deal with an inflation problem by raising interest rates which makes it more expensive for firms and households to borrow so they spend less reducing the pressures that tend to push prices up the turkish central bank did raise rates very sharply last year with its main rate ending up at an eye watering 24 but mr erdogan did not approve what are the president s views on interest rates and inflation mr erdogan s views could hardly be more unorthodox and that is seen as a problem in the financial markets he has called repeatedly for lower interest rates and has restated that view in the last few days he noted that inflation had come down from its highs which is true but he said the main problem was the level of interest rates he said inflation will further decrease with the lowering of interest rates that is exactly the opposite of the view held in central banks financial markets and among academic economists it leaves doubts in the minds of investors about whether the central bank is really independent although so far it has not responded to the president s calls for lower rates is the currency under pressure turkey has a related problem of bouts of sharp currency decline an issue that has resurfaced in the last few week it aggravates an inflation problem by making imported goods more expensive higher interest rates can help stabilise a currency such a move means that investors can earn better returns in the country s currency so they are more inclined to buy it thus pushing its value up or least dissipating some of the pressure for the currency to drop so what steps have president erdogan and the turkish authorities taken for one thing he has blamed outsiders all these are attempts by the west particularly america to corner turkey the banking regulator has launched an investigation into the us firm jp morgan over a report which was seen as undermining the currency we should discipline all market speculators mr erdogan was quoted as saying image source reuters there was also a surge in the cost of borrowing lira in the financial markets some reports said that turkish banks had been told to withhold lira funds which could have been used to speculate against the currency the government has also been operating markets that offer a limited range of foods at lower prices will these measures help the food markets may help some hard pressed families but it is not going to yield a durable solution to turkey s inflation problem as for the steps to stabilise the currency there is a great deal of scepticism
the global economy is weakening in no small measure because of a deep widespread sense of uncertainty and a major source of that uncertainty is the ongoing sino american trade war as lawrence j lau of stanford university has shown the problem is not that tit for tat tariffs have had an especially large impact except perhaps on particular u s and chinese economic sectors rather the conflict has cast doubt on the future of global economic connectivity which has led to lower investment and consumption in china and the united states and among their respective trading partners moreover the chinese state has expanded its role in the economy state owned enterprises are back in favor among young job seekers and in the eyes of the largely state owned banking sector even though many soes really should be restructured rather than kept afloat at the same time many private sector firms are finding credit scarce and very expensive and bankruptcies appear to be on the rise periodic policy interventions to reverse these long standing public private asymmetries have proved insufficient

published friday 29 march 2019 print disqus if you were to tell the average american back in say the 60 s that in 50 years the us would be a command economy they would probably react as if you d lost your mind back in those days the soviet union was a command economy with the government controlling everything with its notorious 5 year plans fast forward to now and the united states and other economic blocs like europe are in the control of central banks it was mayer amschel rothschild who famously said permit me to issue and control the money of a nation and i care not who makes its laws thus we now have a situation where the central banks control economies and societies and are in reality the government so that politicians are reduced to being their operatives the voters are hapless ignorant pawns whose opinions are molded by a media that is also controlled by the central banks and the elites generally democracy is a farce designed to make the masses think they have a say in things by allowing them to go and place their puny worthless vote on one day every four or five years democracy is an absurd concept anyway because you cannot have a situation where ignorant stupid people have the same say in things as intelligent discriminating people who they vastly outnumber where this occurs as it does in western societies the masses opinions are shaped by their favorite media which are controlled by you guessed it the ruling elites so they are simply sheep who can be guided in whatever way their rulers want on those rare occasions when the masses attempt to break free from the control of their masters as with the brexit vote in the uk the elites engage in procrastination and subterfuge until they succeed in getting their way in the case of brexit the uk prime minister teresa may who is an elites stooge has fashioned a win win deal for the brussels elites the thinking behind it is that it is brexit in name only it is so bad for britain that it would be better off staying in the eu which means that there is a high chance that it will be rejected by the british parliament and that is exactly what we are seeing if it is rejected then the eu intends to get it s foot in the door via a 2nd referendum and with the masses now thoroughly fed up with the whole business there is a good chance that they will swing in favor of staying in europe especially as their opinions will have been worked on in the meantime by a scaremongering elite controlled media aiming to put them off the idea of leaving europe if that doesn t work then they only have to stall for time until 2020 when the lisbon treaty comes into effect and at that point britain is an eu vassal state that cannot make decisions for itself any more and will lose the power to opt out once and for all so you see they are not going to let 60 million potential indentured servants break free simply because they want to it is amazing how easy it is to find the answers to seemingly complex issues by asking the simple question who stands to gain for example applying this question we quickly find the answers to the following questions why was iraq invaded answer saddam hussein threatened to sell his oil in a currency other than the dollar which would have undermined dollar hegemony and israel wanted it cut down to size so it was invaded to effect regime change what was 9 11 all about answer to provide an excuse to invade iraq and afghanistan what is the so called war on terror all about answer to maintain a permanent state of war in order to help justify the military industrial complex sucking 1 trillion a year out of dopey us taxpayers this is not a political rant i simply don t have time for those these days there is a reason for making the observations above the point is this that the normal business cycle has been interrupted and distorted by the interference of central banks in europe the ecb and in the us the federal reserve which is not federal at all and is a private concern run for the benefit of its members thus when the us economy should have been purged and cleansed of excess by a healthy deep recession after the 2008 financial crisis the fed intervened with life support in the form of qe quantitative easing which it kept increasing and repeating so that the economy lurched forward in an undead state like frankenstein if we ask why they did this it brings us back to our central question who stands to gain the central banks objective is to gain ever more power and control for itself and to enrich the elites which include its leading members their goal therefore is to maintain the status quo for as long as possible because it serves them so well and to maintain the new normal which is interest rates near to zero for themselves so that they can continue to amass and grow their vast fortunes via arbitrage and speculation while at the same time applying usurious interest rates to the masses who are forced to take out loans for the necessities of life which are now seen to include cars and college education another scam in this way they drain the wealth of the lower and middle classes into their coffers and in recent years we have as you know seen the great american middle class buckling under the strain for this very reason this is why the lower and middle classes are actively encouraged to get into as much debt as possible so that they can be turned into debt slaves which is the modern face of serfdom if they don t run fast enough to keep up timely payments then they are punished with massive charges for late payment speeding up their financial depletion in the light of all this you should be able to understand why the central banks will strive to maintain the status quo for as long as possible so they would prefer not to see a deflationary implosion that would inflict such privation on the masses that they take to the streets in a mood for revolution how can they avert this simple just keep printing more and more money to keep the system limping along and as part of this they have an incentive to keep markets propped up back late last year a bearmarket was starting but the fed averted it by doing a rapid about face signaling that it would reverse course on interest rates and scaling back its assets we got burned shorting the market again during the recent rally having correctly called the initial drop in the expectation that a normal cyclical bearmarket was starting but central bank intervention has stopped it for now what makes us leery of shorting the market again here even though it looks ripe for another downleg is this we have alluded to a fed and or government massive slush fund used to intervene and prop up the markets but it may go much further than that the fed and other central banks like the ecb have been emboldened by their manipulative experiments in recent years and have realized that since they can spirit into existence unlimited quantities of money trillions if they feel like it they can do far more than just prop up global stockmarkets they can drive them higher and higher in what would be for them a virtuous circle they wade in with a few trillion buying stocks across the board and before long they are looking good because the value of their holdings goes up and up encouraging them to buy more and more and since they are only human like the rest of us even if they do have a very high opinion of themselves they get more and more involved driving a tremendous unprecedented spike which eventually blows the markets to smithereens and since the great bullmarket from 2009 did not really end with a spectacular parabolic blowoff phase this scenario could eventuate this is a truly extraordinary possibility that we need to be aware of it will have nothing to do with the real world economy and ordinary people will be blighted with an increasing cost of living as a result of accelerating inflation of prices of basic goods due to trickledown from the massive monetary infusions on the plus side if the central banks do succeed in driving a massive parabolic spike in markets our carefully selected stocks should do very well and when the party ends we will stand ready to flip to bearish and make fortunes when the whole edifice comes crashing down the conclusion to this treatise is to repeat and emphasize its main point which is that western economies and societies have been taken over and are being run by and for the benefit of central banks and their associated elites who are now their effective governments with all politicians being reduced to the position of being their minions and are aided and abetted by a compliant media which they control over the past decade especially they have engaged in unprecedented interference and manipulation of the business cycle creating money and debt on a vast scale and ironing out and eliminating necessary corrective periods or recessions which has caused massive distortions and misallocation of capital the result of all this has been a buildup of debt across all strata of society corporate federal municipal and private to monstrous frightening and ultimately catastrophic levels emboldened by what they see as their recent success in these matters the danger now is that they take center stage in the equity markets by printing up trillions to drive markets higher and higher eventually into a spectacular parabolic spike which will be a virtuous circle for them until the music stops at which point the resulting explosion will be on a par with the cataclysmic eruption of krakatoa in 1883 which could be heard clearly over 3000 miles away egon von greyerz of goldswitzerland has written a series of lurid and terrifying essays about what will happen when this debt edifice comes crashing down but of course most complacently dismiss him as a crank or as an opportunist who is trying to scare people into gold which is his business but unfortunately for all of us von greyerz is right it is also worth noting that not being troubled by scruples of any kind these elites will also implement nirp negative interest rate policy and engage in bail ins which is another name for stealing from customer s accounts and if the going gets tough they will help themselves to as much of account holders money as they see fit i regard this article

regional cooperation is the way to tackle the problem according to the asian competitiveness annual report 2019 one of the four reports issued by the bfa in 2018 27 asian economies improved their competitiveness score compared with a year earlier and the gap between different economies narrowed down indicating healthier and more balanced development of asian countries according to the report the prospects of emerging markets and developing economies in asia remain optimistic and they are still one of the major engines underpinning the world economy it said since the fall of 2018 the world economy has taken a downward trend and uncertain factors accumulated nevertheless asia accounted for 60 percent of the world economic growth showcasing huge vitality and potential kent calder director of the edwin o reischauer center for east asian studies washington d c said in addition the e11 the 11 major emerging market economies in the group of 20 registered 5 1 percent growth in 2018 which was basically in line with the optimism the world economy may trend down in 2019 which will spill over to affect the performance of the e11 but as the economic restructuring brings dividends and reforms deepen in emerging market economies the e11 economy is expected to maintain mid to high growth in 2019 and remains an indispensable driving force for global economic expansion according to the development of emerging economies annual report 2019 the third report the progress of asian economic integration annual report 2019 said 17 new free trade agreements were signed during 2017 18

initiative has brought investment for infrastructure construction which has cut trade costs in the countries on the initiative s routes by 3 5 percent indicating the significance of infrastructure construction the surging demand for high quality infrastructure has given rise to projects such as the belt and road initiative and the master plan on asean connectivity 2025 with countries and regions sparing no effort to address infrastructure financing difficulties this will lay a solid foundation for economic integration in asia it said taking into account the complicated situation asia and emerging market economies are facing the four reports have still indicated confidence in economic development and regional cooperation in asia zhang yuyan quoted an old chinese saying cope with shifting events by sticking to a fundamental principle he said given the current context the fundamental principle has several layers of connotation among which international cooperation is the most important one china has been following this principle all along premier li keqiang delivers a keynote speech at the opening plenary of the boao forum for asia annual conference 2019 in the southern island province of hainan on march 28 xinhua the chinese approach as one of the most crucial links in the asian economic integration china has its own wisdom to cope with uncertainties li daokui director of the academic center for chinese economic practice and thinking tsinghua university said china has become the largest engine and shock absorber for the world economy after 70 years of its development the past 10 years have seen china contribute one fourth to one third of the global growth the experience and lessons accumulated during the 70 years since the founding of the people s republic of china are helping many countries in their development drive gloria macapagal arroyo speaker of the house of representatives the lower house of the congress in the philippines and former president of the island state agreed with li she said china s development has made the world realize that each country can find its own way of development according to its own situation among all the efforts by china to promote integration in asia and globalization the belt and road is a major initiative proposed by china in 2013 it has since gained momentum with countries and regions along the envisioned land and maritime routes joining in the recent signing of a belt and road cooperation memorandum of understanding between china and italy is a new proof of the initiative s popularity china s deepening reform and opening up is also one of the ways to not only benefit china itself but contribute to global development long yongtu former bfa secretary general said long said china should not only introduce capital talent and projects but also growth drivers only by increasing interactions with the outside world and encouraging mutual development can china deepen its own reform and become an innovation driven country innovation was a buzzword at the conference where participants were treated to intelligent vehicle services and ai based simultaneous interpretation regarding concerns over technologies wong kan seng former deputy prime minister of singapore said instead of fearing them people need to embrace them they are no job snatchers but provide more freedom to people to do other things china has demonstrated its innovation in creating new business models such as the sharing economy e commerce and e payment these new innovative growth drivers will not only create advantages for china but generate vitality for the economic development of asia and the rest of the world while experiencing miraculous development china also faces challenges francois hollande former president of france said suggesting china could follow up with new ways to respond to climate change and the problem of an ageing population li daokui said china should also adopt an incentive mechanism to motivate entrepreneurs scientists innovators and government employees to cultivate internal forces for development long emphasized that china has always sought a peaceful environment for development it is an upholder of international order rather than a disruptor there is an old chinese saying that time reveals a man s heart he said time will prove what china s role is in the world

pressure and maintain sound economic fundamentals in the long term larger tax cuts reducing taxes and fees is an equitable inclusive direct and effective reform measure governments at all levels should make the most of the current situation by reducing general expenditures invigorating existing assets and capital and using increased revenues and reduced expenditures to support tax cuts and

in his two and a half years in uzbekistan s top job president shavkat mirziyoyev has been praised for his wide ranging economic and political reforms including efforts to end cotton slavery open the country for tourism and re establish ties with neighboring countries last month the country took another leap forward by entering global capital markets with the sale of its five and 10 year eurobonds although mirziyoyev deserves much of the credit he has received perhaps the unsung hero of uzbekistan s rise has been its little known central bank governor mamarizo nurmuratov previously serving as chairman of the senate committee on budget and economic reforms as well as the country s finance minister nurmuratov was appointed to the central bank governor post in june 2017 after uzbekistan s upper chamber of parliament selected him capital instantly began to flow into the country barely six months into his term the ebrd re opened an office in tashkent and made its first loans to uzbek entities in well over a decade his tenure has also seen tashkent secure funding from the world bank the international finance corporation the asian development bank the asian infrastructure investment bank and the silk road fund capital from east asia and europe has cascaded in response to the country s reformist economic agenda which in itself was driven by a nurmuratov managed monetary policy shift the most significant change came in early september 2017 when the government modernized uzbekistan s foreign exchange market and removed the som s peg to the u s dollar on that day september 5th 2017 the som plunged in value by 48 percent although the original decree was issued by the uzbek president nurmuratov was the one left to stabilize the currency since then the som has appreciated and the central bank has intervened from time to time if only to ease temporary volatility recognizing its positive economic trajectory and solid monetary position credit rating agencies awarded uzbekistan a bb b1 an unusually high score for a first time issuer yet the market was even more bullish still uzbekistan s original debt offering was oversubscribed by seven times despite relatively low yields investor confidence in the newly opened country reflects a tacit respect that asset managers have for nurmuratov or at least an expectation that he will keep the economy on a positive trajectory over the medium term in march 2018 the central bank announced an inflation targeting economic policy framework high inflation remains a major challenge to mirziyoyev s currency reforms inflation hit 17 9 percent in 2018 due to utility price adjustments public sector wage increases a weak som and rapid domestic growth however analysts expect that number to drop back to 16 8 percent in 2019 and 14 percent in 2020 the imf is wary of uzbekistan s relatively high inflation rate which stands between 15 and 16 percent but it also acknowledges that a country in the early stages of market development will inevitably face sub optimal rates of inflation by comparison most post soviet neighbors fared much worse in their reform programs georgia s inflation hit 160 percent in 1995 russia s was still over 45 percent in 1996 and ukraine suffered chronic hyperinflation for half a decade after independence nurmuratov meanwhile is in discussions with the imf to secure additional assistance which could help reduce inflation to a more manageable 13 5 percent nurmuratov still faces several challenges ahead on the one hand the central bank has a limited influence over domestic monetary credit conditions only 20 percent of som based credit is subject to market rates or commercial terms as the central bank continues to transition towards inflation targeting nurmuratov will need to address the high rate of credit segmentation in som based lending furthermore the central bank must provide more tools for regulating and influencing monetary policy in the face of rising inflation as of now the central bank has indicated its willingness to regulate excessive liquidity by altering the banking reserve ratio however it remains to be seen how much of an impact altering said ratio will have despite the reform drive uzbekistan remains a black box few outsiders know who holds the levers of power besides mirziyoyev but it cannot be ignored that the country s central bank policy has been steady and helped to attract significant foreign investment since nurmuratov s ascension the institution if not its leader deserves some credit peter simon is the co founder of ssuinsight com he received his ba from cornell university and his masters from the university of oxford you can find him on twitter petersimon419

the us quest to contain china is becoming a lonely one and for good reasons pressuring allies to bar chinese telecommunications giant huawei from their fifth generation 5g networks could set back their telecom architecture by at least a year or two and cost them billions of dollars preventing allies from joining china s belt and road initiative bri is to demand that they ignore their national interests it might be for these reasons that four major european leaders prime minister giuseppe conte of italy president emmanuel macron of france chancellor angela merkel of germany and president jean claude juncker of the european commission have defied us president donald trump s warnings on huawei and the bri juncker played down china s systematic competitor image suggesting the term was meant to indicate healthy competition between the european union and china merkel went further saying europe should be part of the bri macron vowed to tighten the relationship between his country and china conte signed on to the bri and plans to attend the bri forum in beijing next month responsible leadership by not caving in to us pressure the stances of these european leaders could be construed as responsible leadership promoting and protecting their countries national interests the eu countries have no other means to pull out of the economic stagnation that the us originated 2008 financial crisis created growing at less than 1 annually since then according to international monetary fund figures the us not only offers no alternative financial assistance but is imposing tariffs on eu steel aluminum automobiles and other products what s more washington is acting like a mafia demanding that eu buy more us arms and paying the costs for the privilege of hosting us troops turning to china makes economic sense china though its annual economic growth has slowed to between 6 and 6 5 will still outshine the eu s and america s 2 5 or less in the coming years according to the world bank while all western economies lack fiscal and monetary policy ammunition because of high debts and low interest rate policies to boost economic growth china has the financial means to reverse europe s economic malaise for example it jut signed a contract to buy 300 airbus planes worth more than 30 billion us 33 6 billion moreover china has not shown any indication that it poses a national security threat to any country it has enough problems climate change poverty reduction financial risk of its own to worry about in this sense establishing closer economic relations with the dragon also makes geopolitical sense not worrying about going to war with china better to engage like the west china is protecting its national interests by walking economic development and political paths that suit its history and institutions for china deng xiaoping s theory of socialism with chinese characteristics makes perfect sense it is still at his infant stage of development requiring state subsidies and protection as was the case in europe and america during their early developmental years what s more china is a country of many regions each of which has its own norms and values thus requiring a strong central government to get things done it could indeed be argued that had it not for authoritarianism china would not be what it is today further western state subsidies were front and center during the post financial crisis era in which governments resorted to quantitative easing to bail out out banks and enterprises deemed too big to fail the eu and the us subsidize research and development activities through tax incentives to corporations and grants to universities both heavily subsidize farmers in that eu and us pay respectively nearly 50 and 25 of farmers incomes according to the organization for economic cooperation and development criticizing china s development architecture is thus like the pot calling the kettle black besides china is willing to address issues through negotiations and make concessions for example it is willing to buy more us products to reduce the latter s trade deficits and bar forced technology transfers albeit it is unclear why a condition of doing business is considered forced the foreign partner has a choice it does not have to do business with chinese firms one could indeed argue that transferring advanced technology would increase productivity leading to higher profits in any event china is too big to coerce hell has to freeze over before china will surrender its economic and political architectures suggesting cooperation is the only way going forward in any event china is too big to coerce hell has to freeze over before china will surrender its economic and political architectures suggesting cooperation is the only way going forward the world except the us and a few of its staunch allies has come to that conclusion explaining why europe asia latin america and africa are seeking rapprochement with beijing even new zealand a diehard us ally is trying to mend fences with the dragon after following the us lead of barring huawei from its 5g network exports to china and the number of chinese tourists declined because of her country s reliance on the china new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern is to travel to china next week to put the relationship back on track the speculation that chinese made equipment could be used to spy on new zealand is just that speculation and using the same logic new zealand should not buy apple samsung nokia or ericsson products because they too are made or assembled in china besides what secrets does new zealand have that china wants to steal canada too is finding out the hard way the cost of siding with the us in arresting huawei chief financial officer meng wanzhou for allegedly violating us unilateral sanctions or iran it just lost the china market for its granola seeds and more retaliatory measures will likely emerge if meng is extradited to the us in addition two canadians held on spying charges remain incarcerated the irony of the canadian decision to arrest meng at the behest of the us is that trump still treats canada as a national security threat maintaining tariffs on canadian steel and aluminum the fact of the matter is that china cannot be isolated without inflicting unthinkable damage to its tormentors for example the us is losing just as much if not more than china from the trade war a joint study conducted by the us federal reserve and some elite universities such as columbia and harvard estimated that the trade war could cost more than 1 trillion over five years china s loss from the trade war is more psychological than economics in that exports to the us represent only 4 of its gross domestic product which could be easily absorbed by its huge domestic market and the bri china and the bri participants represent more than 40 and 50 of world gdp and population respectively according to the world bank the world is increasingly defying the us on containing china because doing so harms national interests as the 19th century british diplomat henry temple observed nations have no permanent friends or foes only national interests what s more us pressure and threats are based on fake news and fear mongering the us should respect other countries interests and rights otherwise it could become the world s lone ranger

mar 28 2019 alasdair macleod why is it that no one defends free markets and socialism despite all the evidence of its failures comes back again and again unsurprisingly the answer lies in politics which have always led to a boom bust cycle of collective behaviour furthering our understanding of this phenomenon is timely because the old advanced economies burdened by a combination of existing and future debt appear to be on the verge of an unhappily coordinated bust but that does not automatically return us to the free markets some of us long for cycles of collective behaviour throughout history there have been few long lasting periods of truly free markets contemporary exceptions are confined to some small island states forced to be entrepreneurial by their size and position vis à vis the larger nations with which they trade the governments of these islands know that the state itself is not suited to entrepreneurship only by the state guarding the freedom of island markets and the sanctity of property rights can entrepreneurs serve the people in these communities and create wealth for all this is not the normal condition for larger nations before the scottish enlightenment which nurtured david hume and adam smith the benefits of free trade were barely understood since then the wealth created by free trade and sound money has nearly always been the springboard for detrimental change sometimes a political strongman like mao or lenin dictates to the people what they can and cannot do alternatively a leader courts popularity by taxing heavily the few for the alleged benefit of the masses this is the model of welfare states today debasement of the means of exchange is an extension of these socialising policies furthering the transfer of personal wealth to the state to understand why free markets are more often than not unpopular we must put them into a context of human behaviour in this regard we can stylise a cycle of collective behaviour into three characteristic phases the first is a lawless condition of no secure ownership of property rights in the absence of enforceable law the means of possession are necessarily violent and uncertain it is the natural condition of tribalism and pre civilisation societies it is the condition to which humanity returns when the cycle completes the second phase is the consolidation of property ownership with enforceable laws to define and protect it out of the chaos that fails to advance the condition of the people comes order and with it the aggregation of the means of production capital in all the forms necessary for production accumulates and being scarce is used most efficiently the backbone of this phase is freedom for the individual to dispose of his or her resources at will the pace of improvement in the human condition is governed by the level of accumulated wealth and technological innovation the third phase is the abandonment of free markets in favour of state control the state whose primary function in economic terms is to act as provider and facilitator of the law increasingly supresses commerce by extracting escalating levels of tax taxes are imposed to redistribute wealth from those that earned and conserved it to those that did not the state takes control of money issuing its own currency which it can print at will the damages to the economy are covered up by all the artifices available to the state the state regulates the state confiscates the state deprives its people of their freedom the state s demands become so insatiable so counterproductive so impoverishing that the economy collapses back into the first phase of the next cycle that is our theoretical cycle of collective behaviour out of chaos is created progress out of progress lies the course to destruction the best of these times is the free markets of the second phase no one defends them empirical evidence of the cycle the assembly of german states into a unified nation in 1871 gave credence to a new socialising phenomenon whereby bismarck germany s first chancellor promoted the state as a socialising entity superseding free markets he was the first politician to create a welfare state introducing accident and old age insurance and socialised medicine shortly after unification in the mid 1870s bismarck abandoned free trade and introduced trade protectionism his policies echoed the principles of the german historical school which drove intellectual thought in the prussian administration the historical school rejected the classical economics of smith ricardo and mill in favour of a controlling state backed up by analysis of historical events hence the name these lessons were applied to the changing conditions at that time workers were moving from the land into new factories and it was the german establishment s outdated response to an entirely new social phenomenon the creation of a new german socialising state and the denial of economic liberalism inevitably led to the founding of chartalism the state theory of money which stated that only the state has the right to determine the currency used by the people georg knapp published his state theory of money in 1905 he handed bismarck the key to unlock constraints on state spending the state was then able to consolidate its potential both in its bureaucracy and military armament we all know what happened it fed into to the first world war and in 1923 resulted in the collapse of the currency it is worth reflecting that a cycle of events occurred taking ordinary germans to full state socialism from a freedom to improve their personal circumstances the start of it was promising with the introduction of the zollverein a customs union between independent german speaking states the roots of the zollverein were in the 1830s consolidated and formalised in 1861 it preceded the formation of a greater germany in 1871 it was the gateway to political union and statist economic management it is a doppelganger for the development of the european union today but the underlying point for eu watchers is that it was a cycle of events taking a nation through the erosion of laissez faire to full state domination of economic activity and monetary affairs in germany s case the political consequences of the first world war and the collapse of the currency were not the end of the story or the cycle the rise of extreme fascist socialism finally led to the destruction of the german state in 1945 the return to free markets under ludwig erhard s guidance followed his appointment as director of the economic council for the occupation zone and completed the cycle cometh the hour cometh the man soviet occupied germany was not so lucky erhard had to ignore the instincts and orders of his fellow american and british military committee members who were stuck in a bureaucratic militaristic frame of mind in july 1948 without consulting them erhard abolished all rationing and price controls almost instantly shops reopened food became available the suppressed mood lifted and people began to rebuild their lives by way of contrast victorious socialist britain continued with rationing until 1954 when meat rationing finally ended the evolution in germany from free markets through increasingly destructive statism and back again to free markets had taken nearly eighty years from unification in 1871 russia suffered a similar though initially more dramatic socialist change from relatively free markets instead of a progressive introduction of state control and loss of personal freedom it was sudden and absolute after three years of civil war and using a ready made marxist template lenin seized and consolidated control both lenin and stalin his successor were ruthless in their suppression of freedom tens of millions were deemed to be enemies of the state which included those who merely disagreed or of the wrong race they were executed or sent to the gulags that suppression lasted until the soviets had impoverished their people to the point where there was nothing left in 1989 after seventy odd years the ussr finally collapsed the german and russian experiences tell us in their own ways that because the beneficiaries of free trade fail to defend it free trade does not last anyone reading about life in vienna before the first world war would be struck by the widespread prosperity freedom and artistic flowering of the age which was destroyed by the war and a subsequent collapse of the currency it is unfashionable in our socialist times to defend those pre war years as good times i personally grew up with the free market prosperity of britain s african colonies a prosperity that benefited not just the better off europeans but indigenous african and asian communities as well that was destroyed by political imperatives the call for independence from british rule by those who had benefited from the free markets they set out to then destroy fully functioning free market economies were replaced throughout africa by corrupt elites that still steal their way to personal prosperity it is no accident that post independence african leaders embraced socialism as the justification for their actions they argued that the european landowners had seized property which was in the communal ownership of the tribes and that a newly independent state had the right to seize it back but they ignored the fact that before the arrival of europeans there was no ownership nor property law to define it occupation was by force it is a no more than a common socialist justification for the state to acquire for itself private property in only fifty years free markets had taken the ordinary native in the african heartlands from ignorance of the wheel to the age of jet engines and skyscrapers never before have tribal communities witnessed such rapid social change we forget the appalling conditions and routine cruelty that existed before the introduction of western capitalism those conditions are best summed up in a quote from tacitus writing about the german tribes in 98ad it seems feckless nay more even slothful to acquire something by toil and sweat which you could grab by the shedding of blood he could have been describing the cattle raids that still occur today in kenya s northern frontier district and laikipia nearly two millennia after tacitus described tribal germania in africa similar disorder reigned before white settlers developed the land to escape a subsistence stasis that had seemingly existed for ever disorder had to be replaced by the white man s order through the introduction of capital and property ownership free markets allowed the whole population to rapidly improve its condition without these crucial ingredients there can be no progress socialism unwittingly returns civilisation to an unenlightened state by encroaching upon then abolishing both property ownership and the accumulation of capital the economy is hindered in its progress until it withers on the vine a nation then returns to its pre capitalist state of lawlessness corruption brutality and widespread poverty once again cattle raiding and similar actions become the means of ownership but if this repetitive cycle is so obvious why does humanity fall into the same cyclical trap time and again the psychology of denying free markets cycles of human behaviour require a build up of human prejudice until it becomes unsustainable one human prejudice which is little examined is why establishments frequently stick to their convictions while denying reasonable debate as we have seen much of the answer is that a version of self serving economic dogma becomes central to the credibility of statist policies we see it today with our post keynesian economic establishment driving economic and monetary policies while denying the superiority of unfettered markets in these matters anyone who challenges the unreason of the establishment s economics will risk personal vilification and be side lined create the belief structure and the government can justify any action leadership becomes more effective when it is based on prevailing doctrines with minds firmly closed to all evidence to the contrary all types of socialism demonstrate opinions insulated from inconvenient contradictions a socialising government can then appear independent and fair minded serving the people when it actually serves itself new dogmas become entrenched the government and also the public like our hunter gatherer forebears in their communal caves huddle round the mutual safety of the new consensus concerning the government s contradictions comfort is sought by the public from the government itself it becomes an iterative process that allows the state to drift remorselessly away from free markets not only with public consent but public encouragement it is the basis of groupthink the enemy of reason to the building self ignorance is added an overestimation of understanding complex issues an understanding bias that is reinforced by debate on terms set by society itself represented by the media editors select complex issues which they reduce to simplified choices that are then discussed by invited participants the debate always proceeds on the basis of which government intervention or regulation is most likely to achieve a given objective spoil the party by insisting that personal freedom is preferable to any government intervention you damage the media ratings and you will be deemed a maverick never to be invited back contradiction becomes too difficult to take a form of naïve realism develops whereby talking heads promote themselves as supporting the assimilation of a consensus furthermore they believe that those that do not subscribe to the consensus are irrational biased uneducated and ignorant by these means the benefits of free markets and individualism are increasingly suppressed economists are paid to promote policies in favour of the state s control of money the universities develop an anti market bias and free market economists are unable to secure paid professorships the position these toadying experts occupy was summed up by john ioannidis a professor of medicine at stamford university scientists in a given field may be prejudiced purely because of their belief in a scientific theory or commitment to their own findings prestigious investigators may suppress via the peer review process the appearance and dissemination of findings that refute their findings thus condemning their field to perpetuate false dogma empirical evidence on expert opinion shows it is extremely unreliable disappointingly we all assume scientists are disciplined in their specialisations and unbiased not so in economics there is the extra problem of human unpredictability to which is added a total lack of precise definition soundly reasoned theory is swept aside by the introduction of unreliable and often extraneous statistics as the feedstock for mathematical equations reason freedom and free markets are the casualties instead of reasoning for ourselves and recognising the flaws in debate we trust an elite to guide our thoughts with their knowledge alongside the elite there is a cadre of self anointing experts consulted by the media we place value on their independence we see them as informed insiders but we forget their privileged access depends solely on supporting the party line it is a profitable after life for those who had power a self congratulatory basis for the concealed promotion of social policy when it gets left behind by progress the static socialist state eventually becomes the author of its own destruction only then might the psychological consensus of denying free markets be broken if we are lucky out of the ensuing chaos a new commitment to free markets rapidly emerges more likely it becomes the opportunity for extremism as germany showed in the aftermath of its inflation collapse of 1923 contemporary socialist evolutions as economic historians we observe the faults of others usually without recognising them in ourselves mainly for the psychological reasons noted above most economic historians selectively approach the subject with the bias of their culture and generation the story of bismarck s germany is hardly known in english literature and the lessons are lost in an english speaking world the fall of communism in the ussr is fresh in our minds but the struggles of the state under yeltsin to replace it with a market based economy and the ensuing corruption is more topical in britain many have forgotten the appalling services and products of nationalised monopolies british railways british telecom british leyland to name just a few consequently the brits as well as other socialists in the west are never adequately deterred in their antagonism against free markets to change their minds bernie sanders desire to run again for president and the marxism of jeremy corbin are testament to the short mindedness of the voting public it is a wilful ignorance that defends socialism and never defends free markets in america socialism is being challenged by president trump without us examining his beliefs too closely he obviously knows that the government establishment has been strangling the us economy his dislike of the democrats and their policies under obama identifies him as an enemy of socialism but as a free marketeer trump does not defend free markets instead he ends up defending crony capitalism military spending and monetary inflation his trade protectionism strongly echoing bismarck s policies in the late nineteenth century is similarly socialism under the banner of nationalism far from rescinding the socialist tide donald trump is swimming in it trump s trade policies as i ve argued in another article are driving america and therefore the world into a deep recession under current monetary policies the result will be a spectacular increase in monetary inflation which could lead to the destruction of the dollar if this happens trump almost certainly will be blamed not socialism that being the case the destruction of the american economy and perhaps the dollar with it will not be the end of socialism and the return to free markets by not properly understanding free markets president trump risks condemning his nation and his legacy to a more intense post crisis socialism similar to that which fuelled fascism in 1920s germany if so we can only hope the period will be brief economists in the free market tradition can only forecast the likely economic and monetary consequences of current policies the laissez faire tradition tells us a failing government should stop intervening and restrict itself to ensuring basic criminal and contract law is enforced it should stop monetary inflation as ludwig erhard demonstrated in 1948 free markets left alone rapidly restore economic order but that is not the socialising instinct as long as there is breath in socialism free markets will continue to be supressed the foundation of the european union echoes the tactical approach of bismarck corral a group of nations into a zollverein customs union then steer them towards political integration as the german historical school was for bismarck marxist socialism becomes the driving force for the eu innocuously at first by encouraging free trade within the union free trade is then hampered by bureaucratic regulation in the names of common standards fairness and further integration already planned are the imposition of new federal taxes to extend the power of the brussels government and the building of a new pan european military force pure bismarck and pure brussels witness the struggle with brexit where it turns out the westminster parliament is comprised of an overwhelming majority of members who are committed to the eu s socialising masterplan to the exclusion of democracy even a majority of tory mps the party of free enterprise prefers a federal socialist system to free markets it is the stuff of late stage socialism the whole world is in its grip rather than just germany just the ussr just america just the eu or just britain and these are only some among the traditionally advanced nations being cyclical the bankruptcy of it all in time is for sure it is set to throw up greater challenges than ever seen before because of its ubiquity assuming it does not end in a nuclear destruction of the human race we will eventually turn our backs on the follies of socialising governments and go back to free markets then the cycle of humanity s socialising madness will start all over again tacitus germania as quoted in von mises socialism pp37

bond markets will remain on edge in the coming week as the reserve bank of australia could become the next central bank to switch to a dovish stance and possibly amplify the flight to safety which has sent sovereign bond yields plummeting another catalyst for market volatility could come from the us jobs report which has the capacity to either reverse or extend the rally in bond prices there will be no shortage of us data with plenty of other key releases on the agenda while brexit headlines won t be going away anytime soon as more votes are planned in the british parliament pressure grows on rba to talk rate cuts after the reserve bank of new zealand this week signalled a rate cut could be on the cards its australian counterpart will be under pressure to indicate a similar shift at its policy meeting on tuesday however having dropped its tightening bias only in february it may be too soon for the rba to take another big leap especially as it s clinging on to hopes that a strong labour market will steer the economy out of the soft patch if the rba does not adjust its policy stance the australian dollar is vulnerable to upside moves following this week s losses when it fell in

become more pessimistic non manufacturers will likely signal sentiment holding steady a bigger worry though could be their capital spending plans both big and small firms are forecast to report a drop in capital expenditure in q2 which would point to slower gdp growth the yen could see some downside pressure if the tankan survey disappoints other data to be watched out of japan next week will be

though the loonie would probably struggle to make any substantial gains given the bank of canada s dovish tilt

by rob glownia chris konstantinos doug sandler and rod smyth riverfront investment management why we aren t currently concerned the 3 month 10 year yield curve inverted last friday if you re not exactly sure what that means you re not alone considering google searches for the term yield curve apparently spiked last friday therefore we re dedicating this weekly view to explain the yield curve discuss why it s now inverted and suggest how investors should react to this information what is a yield curve the yield curve is the relationship between shorter and longer term interest rates a line drawn through the different interest rate maturities from the fed funds overnight rate to 30 year bond yields is rarely a straight line and so often resembles a curve most of the time this curve is upward sloping with short term interest rates typically lower than long term interest rates this is because investors demand a premium for having their rates fixed for longer periods of time what is an inverted yield curve long story short an inverted yield curve means that short term interest rates are higher than long term interest rates as mentioned above investors typically demand higher interest rates for longer maturities however when bond investors feel like the federal reserve has already raised interest rates too high or that a recession is imminent long term rates can fall below short term ones inverting the shape of the curve this phenomenon is mostly observed in the later stages of an economic cycle and the yield curve has inverted prior to the last 7 recessions in the united states dating back to 1970 we re not currently concerned about the inverted curve although it s always dangerous to assume it s different this time we don t believe investors should consider this inversion as a signal for an imminent recession there are a few reasons for this conclusion we re still in a low interest rate environment with few signs of inflation global central bank action has depressed long term rates distorting the signal as the yield curve has become more closely monitored it is unlikely to be the valuable early warning indicator it once was we ll discuss each of these reasons below interest rates and inflation are still low despite the fed s hiking cycle in 2018 absolute interest rates are still extremely low relative to history the federal reserve is also in a much different position today relative to prior periods that the yield curve inverted historically short term rates were hiked by the federal reserve sometimes intentionally above long term rates in hopes to stave off inflation and cool down the economy as short term rates go higher levered companies and individuals are forced to deal with higher costs of capital which eventually leads to recession in 2018 the fed was following a more typical rate hiking pattern which they expected to continue in a dramatic turnaround the fed recently pivoted its policy noting that there are few signs of inflation and that they will exhibit patience regarding any future rate increases even with the curve inverted borrowing costs are still affordable and capital markets continue to function well in fact as rates have recently fallen companies have been able to refinance and service their debt at even more attractive levels for these reasons we do not foresee a credit induced crisis that leads to a recession over the next twelve months global central banks have been exceptionally accommodative for the last decade central banks have suppressed interest rates through various quantitative easing qe programs which involved buying bonds this has been evident in the us but also in europe and japan where these economies have faced even more deflationary pressures and slower growth prospects qe programs combined with maturity targeting by the central banks have dramatically increased the quantity of short term securities available while significantly decreasing the availability of longer maturity bonds given these changes to short term and long term supply it is not surprising to see upward pressure on short term rates and downward pressure on long term rates the net result in our view is that the yield curve has been distorted by qe and that the efficacy of inversion as a recession signal has been diluted furthermore we believe the decline in us long term interest rates is less due to the us economic trajectory and more the result of slowing economies in asia and europe while this is a legitimate concern we expect these economies will start to recover in the 2nd half of this year due to current efforts by governments and central banks especially in china yield curve has gone mainstream generally you don t get hit by the train you see coming unless you re tied to the tracks like in an old western movie given the historical success of the yield curve as a recession signal it has become more popular and has a lot of eyes watching it consistent with the old adage a watched pot never boils we believe it is unlikely that this recession signal will remain the sure fire indicator that it was in the past imperfect track record we shouldn t forget that the 3m 10y yield curve did invert in the late 1960 s without a recession to follow furthermore it came close to inverting in 1998 but the next recession didn t come until a few years afterward in fact while this signal might have called the last 7 recessions it gives no indication regarding the timing of the next recession as you can see in the chart of the week the yield curve initially inverted almost two years prior to the global financial crisis 3m 10y yield curve chart of the week source thomson reuters datastream fathom consulting data monthly as of 3 22 19 past performance is no guarantee of future results shown for illustrative purposes only bottom line yield curve inversions have typically been an ominous sign for investors and have been an indication of upcoming recession however we feel the current economic environment casts doubt on this signal for the reasons laid out in this piece therefore we are not ready to shift our strategy of preferring equities over bonds furthermore we do not believe the us will enter recession in 2019 however it is always dangerous to assume that it s different this time therefore we will continue to observe this relationship closely as well as monitor the way in which other market participants interpret the signal markets can be vulnerable in the short run when common rules of thumb get violated because investors commonly shoot first

bond markets will remain on edge in the coming week as the reserve bank of australia could become the next central bank to switch to a dovish stance and possibly amplify the flight to safety which has sent sovereign bond yields plummeting another catalyst for market volatility could come from the us jobs report which has the capacity to either reverse or extend the rally in bond prices there will be no shortage of us data with plenty of other key releases on the agenda while brexit headlines won t be going away anytime soon as more votes are planned in the british parliament pressure grows on rba to talk rate cuts after the reserve bank of new zealand this week signalled a rate cut could be on the cards its australian counterpart will be under pressure to indicate a similar shift at its policy meeting on tuesday however having dropped its tightening bias only in february it may be too soon for the rba to take another big leap especially as it s clinging on to hopes that a strong labour market will steer the economy out of the soft patch if the rba does not adjust its policy stance the australian dollar is vulnerable to upside moves following this week s losses when it fell in sympathy with the kiwi but the aussie could suffer even sharper declines if the central bank does not turn more dovish but ahead of the rba meeting chinese manufacturing pmis could set the tone for the aussie china s official manufacturing pmi is due on sunday with the caixin markit manufacturing pmi following on monday both indices are forecast to stay in contractionary territory below 50 for

economic environment globally and in japan the boj s own survey the tankan should provide policymakers and investors some clues as to how businesses performed in the first quarter and their outlook for the upcoming quarter the report out on monday is forecast to show confidence falling across all sectors of the economy in q1 but for the second quarter although manufacturers are expected to become more pessimistic non manufacturers will likely signal sentiment holding steady a bigger worry though could be their capital spending plans both big and small firms are forecast to report a drop in capital expenditure in q2 which would point to slower gdp growth the yen could see some downside pressure if the tankan survey disappoints other data to be watched out of japan next week will be february household spending and wage growth numbers on friday ecb minutes and flash cpi to underline euro weakness the euro whipsawed last week initially rallying from the dovish fed meeting but later plunging on the back of poor eurozone pmi figures there was more euro selling this week after ecb chief mario draghi hinted at further delays to a rate hike and the negative pressure will likely continue next week as the european central bank publishes its account of the march policy meeting on thursday while no surprises are anticipated from the march minutes when the ecb pushed back its rate hike timeline and announced a fresh round of cheap loans for banks it will probably highlight the downside risks for euro area growth and inflation eurozone data is not expected to do the single

heterogeneity and the ecb s monetary policy speech by benoît cœuré at the banque de france symposium 34th suerf colloquium on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the euro on the euro area staying the course through uncertainties paris 29 march 2019 from the beginning of the euro area s existence it was well known that it did not meet all of the classic requirements of an optimal currency area some critics have seen heterogeneity across member states as the factor that would ultimately cause the collapse of the single currency but the euro is still here despite years of crisis while managing heterogeneity between regions and countries has been a challenge at times tremendously so this challenge is not insurmountable no single currency area in the world is free of heterogeneity including the ones widely regarded as most homogeneous in my remarks this morning i will argue that the ecb has always found ways to accommodate heterogeneity particularly at times when it threatened to impair the uniform transmission of monetary policy but i will also argue that if we want to minimise episodes of demoralising output and employment losses as we experienced after the financial and euro area crises and if we want to avoid overburdening monetary policy then policymakers need to act more forcefully to reduce the major sources of euro area heterogeneity that is we need a better economic policy framework pre crisis view on heterogeneity to structure my remarks i would like to briefly recall the pre crisis view on heterogeneity in the euro area inflation differentials between regions and countries were not only thought to be unavoidable they were in fact thought to be a desirable feature of a currency union the idea was that the structural transformations sparked by monetary integration and the single market together with the free movement of goods capital services and labour would create the conditions for all countries to thrive and exploit their comparative advantages the prime concern at the time was that if these inflation differentials persisted they could undermine price competitiveness and thus hold back growth this view was corroborated by the fact that inflation dispersion among euro area countries was not very different from the level observed between us metropolitan areas but it was much more persistent you can see both aspects on my first slide the idea that heterogeneity could impair monetary policy transmission and jeopardise the stability of the euro area was a distant thought for three main reasons first cross border financial integration was on the rise and was increasingly seen as an effective shield against idiosyncratic shocks a broad operational framework for monetary policy that took into account the heterogeneity of both the ecb s counterparties and available collateral would complement growing market based defences second the euro area was built on the idea or one might say the hope of monetary dominance with policymakers in all other domains supporting the ecb s area wide mandate by addressing nominal and real rigidities and by running prudent fiscal policies which could be used in rainy days such support was a necessary complement to a single monetary policy which would be overburdened if it were held accountable for national developments and third the pre crisis view was inspired by growing evidence that inflation expectations across the euro area had largely decoupled from actual national inflation outcomes and had converged towards the ecb s definition of price stability in other words the combination of balanced fiscal policies over the cycle the ecb s track record and a clear primary mandate provided for a stable nominal anchor for the euro area as a whole this served to coordinate the largely decentralised decisions of price and wage setters within and between heterogeneous economies the need to enhance private risk sharing in the euro area this pre crisis view was not wrong but it underestimated the shortcomings in the euro area s institutional framework and its potential to unleash diverging forces let me take each aspect in turn starting with financial integration european capital markets indeed appeared to be becoming more integrated and hence provided for increased cross border risk sharing before 2008 you can see this clearly on my next slide which shows a composite indicator of euro area financial integration produced by the ecb but since the crisis broke integration has reversed it currently stands at 0 2 on a scale where zero represents full fragmentation as a result cross border risk sharing in the euro area is almost non existent on my next slide you can see that currently around 80 of a country specific output shock remains unsmoothed while in the united states it is at most 40 for a state specific shock more worryingly the negative green bars point to a dangerous procyclical credit channel in the euro area that is households and firms borrow abroad in good times and pay back in bad times these aspects were often overlooked before the crisis financial frictions for example were largely absent from mainstream central bank models generally speaking there was a lack of attention to financial plumbing to the fact that differences in liquidity capital and supervisory standards meant that banks reaction to shocks could magnify heterogeneity the creation of the banking union has fixed many of these shortcomings but not all of them in particular without further private risk sharing idiosyncratic shocks will continue to cause persistent dispersion in economic outcomes you can see this clearly on my next slide dispersion in real per capita private consumption across euro area countries was twice its historical levels for a period of more than three years after the outbreak of the global financial crisis by the same standard the effects of recession and financial crisis are hardly visible for the united states monetary policy cannot eliminate such persistent differences but it can accommodate them we have proven that a carefully calibrated package of non standard policy measures including our targeted long term refinancing operations asset purchases forward guidance and negative rates can successfully overcome even significant causes of heterogeneity such as the impairment of the bank lending channel across large parts of the single currency area in the wake of the euro area s sovereign debt crisis you can see this on my next slide today the bank lending channel in the euro area is fully operational after years of fragmentation to protect this achievement we decided at our last monetary policy meeting in march to launch a new series of targeted long term refinancing operations tltro iii starting in september 2019 but to address the underlying vulnerabilities and to bolster the credit and capital channels of risk sharing we urgently need to make progress in completing the banking union and kick starting the capital markets union financial markets that can absorb shocks efficiently reduce the need for macroeconomic stabilisation and thereby free up costly political capital structural policies to enhance resilience and feed convergence the second aspect of pre crisis thinking concerned the role other policy domains should play in supporting the single monetary policy i will focus here on the structural side and turn to fiscal policy in a minute although pre crisis policy advice strongly focused on reducing nominal and real rigidities in product and labour markets today there are still significant differences across countries in the response to common euro area wide shocks my next slide shows two ways of looking at this on the left hand side you can see ecb research on the extent to which output in each country responds to a common area wide shock clearly there are significant differences even among countries of broadly comparable size on the right hand side you can see eurosystem estimates of the slope of the phillips curve it shows a high degree of heterogeneity across euro area countries for the sensitivity of core inflation to economic slack in other words country specific factors of inflation remain considerable for example the degree of wage negotiation centralisation these factors are also related to national institutions the upshot is that in this environment monetary policy is more difficult to calibrate different transmission mechanisms propagate the same shock to different degrees and with lags that may vary across countries minimising these differences in transmission does not require all countries to adopt the same economic structures what matters is for countries to have institutions that deliver the right outcomes both individually and jointly our system of economic coordination the european semester still falls short of achieving this objective and as a consequence it still falls short of supporting adequately the single monetary policy strengthening domestic institutions is not only about improving shock absorption capabilities it is also about cohesion and sowing the seeds for renewed convergence you can see this on my next slide the more benign pre crisis view of heterogeneity reflected the fact that the direction of travel was at least similar among euro area countries and not too different from say the united states as you can see from the chart the longer we wait to improve the quality of the institutions that underpin domestic growth and living standards the larger the gap will be that separates the best from the rest my next slide emphasises the close empirical relationship between the quality of national institutions and living standards this is primarily a national responsibility meaning that in order to recreate convergence the heavy lifting has to be done by reforms in individual member states that said the recently proposed budgetary instrument for competitiveness and convergence in the euro area is a useful and necessary complement strengthening policy complementarities the third and last pre crisis aspect concerned the role of monetary policy in coordinating price adjustments in a heterogeneous currency union the ecb s definition of price stability had become a strong area wide nominal anchor that largely marginalised the effects of actual inflation outcomes on expected future inflation thereby cushioning cross country heterogeneity you can see this on my next slide before the crisis survey based long term inflation expectations revealed no statistically significant response to changes in actual hicp inflation they were well anchored at levels below but close to 2 you can see this on the right hand side but the persistence of the effects of the crisis has at times challenged the coordinating role of monetary policy we have faced instances where protracted softness in actual inflation has contributed to a reappraisal of medium to long term inflation expectations you can see this in the grey range moving away from the zero line on the left hand chart between 2010 and 2015 forceful monetary policy action has succeeded in restoring the important role that stable inflation expectations play for the inflation process in a heterogeneous currency union the chart clearly demonstrates that the announcement of the asset purchase programme in january 2015 helped to avert the danger of current inflation dragging down expected inflation but vulnerabilities remain nowhere is this more visible than in market based inflation expectations you can see this on the left hand side of my next slide according to option prices the probability that inflation would be between 1 5 and 2 over the next five years fell measurably as the euro area economy weakened over the course of 2018 on the right hand side you can see that medium term inflation expectations are currently close to 1 3 down from 2 5 ten years ago this no doubt partly reflects global factors inflation expectations in the united states have fallen too but apart from a short temporary blip at the end of 2016 the gap between market based medium term inflation expectations in the united states and the euro area is the widest it has been for more than four and a half years this suggests that idiosyncratic factors are at work too i would argue though that this is unlikely to be related to concerns about the ecb s credibility a breakdown of inflation linked swap rates into expected inflation and an inflation risk premium suggests that medium term inflation expectations have remained close to levels consistent with price stability you can see this on the left hand side of my last slide this is in line with our reading of survey based inflation expectations rather the marked fall in the inflation risk premium suggests that investors assign only a small probability to inflation turning out to be higher than expected again this is a global phenomenon but in my view it is also linked to the unique institutional architecture that sets the euro area apart from other constituencies it relates to the question of how monetary and fiscal policies can optimally interact and reinforce each other in an environment in which policy space is significantly smaller today than it was before the crisis our response to such concerns should not be to challenge our institutional arrangements it should not be about blurring the lines between monetary and fiscal policies central bank independence which has clear and indisputable benefits is a public good that needs protection instead our response should be about strengthening complementarities ecb research shows that during the early stages of the latest recovery monetary policy was the dominant driver of growth you can see this on the right hand side other policies subtracted from growth this has changed more recently the euro area aggregate fiscal stance will be slightly expansionary in 2019 and will thereby support monetary policy but to do it in a sustainable way it needs to be adequately distributed while countries that have fiscal space should use it in countries where government debt is high rebuilding fiscal buffers is the best contribution to support the single monetary policy and while not all countries have the space to spend more all have the opportunity to spend better if fiscal policy preferences contribute to disinflationary concerns for example by holding back public investments in education future technologies and research and development then they directly counteract the efforts of monetary policy to bring inflation back to levels closer to 2 conclusion heterogeneity is part of the euro area s dna it is a source of strength provided our institutions and markets have the instruments and ability to effectively absorb idiosyncratic shocks heterogeneous currency unions need a sufficient degree of private and public risk sharing and they need economic policymakers doing their part to preserve and nurture cohesion and convergence not doing so means that too much of the burden of macroeconomic stabilisation falls on the ecb thereby challenging the achievement of its medium term price stability objective thank you
at 58 madeline olmeda still believes the american dream is to be a homeowner even though the odds are not stacked in her favor olmeda a teacher at south mountain middle school has done it before in a different economy with a different set of personal circumstances at a time when there were significantly more options she s trying again waiting as long as it takes for the right circumstances to line up three bedrooms a garage a suburban location in the 150 000 170 000 range this is the magical elusive sector of homes that have become almost impossible to find in the lehigh valley particularly in the suburbs and even more difficult to build and the options that remain are increasingly difficult for the average wage earner to afford as evidenced by last year s historically low measures of housing affordability both nationally and in the lehigh valley housing affordability is pinpointed by the housing affordability index which measures how easily a middle income person can buy a medium priced home in the lehigh valley it crept down to the low 140s in the fall of 2018 levels not seen since late 2008 the housing affordability index for the lehigh valley since the great recession a higher number means greater affordability yet the region s overall economy is soaring with a recent survey ranking the lehigh valley in the top five midsize metropolitan areas in the united states for economic growth the disconnect lies largely in the inventory both old and new the sweet spot in south bethlehem on a sloped tract of land beneath lehigh university s mountaintop campus everything was lining up smoothly for a proposed owner occupied development pitched as workforce housing 26 twin homes selling at a market rate of around 180 000 200 000 along with 10 twins designated as land trust housing for people whose income is below 80 percent of the median the community action committee of the lehigh valley secured more 1 million dollars in subsidies for the project dubbed city lights the lot was cleared the property was appraised the banks were agreeable to financing the city of bethlehem was a backer ellen larmer the associate executive director of community development at community action committee of the lehigh valley stands in a vacant lot that should have been a housing development there was a tremendous amount of support said ellen larmer associate executive director of community development at calcv but in the end it all comes down to the number by the end of 2018 it became clear that the cost of construction yielded margins too tight for any builder it was the curve ball we couldn t hit said alan jennings caclv s executive director it s the poster child for the market s inability to create affordable housing it demonstrates that what s sweet for buyers homes in the 150 000 200 000 range stayed on the market for the least amount of time on average in 2018 just 30 days according to the annual report from the greater lehigh valley realtors group is not nearly sweet enough for builders in the lehigh valley the proposed city lights workforce housing development in south bethlehem was planned for this grassy slope behind lehigh university the project including several market rate twin homes fell through because of construction costs the cost of lumber spiked significantly in 2018 adding to a growing list of factors including the cost of land and labor that makes building homes in this range virtually profitless to get under 250 000 for a townhome is very difficult now said rick koze owner and president of allentown based kay builders one of the lehigh valley s prolific builders builders working without government subsidies certainly aren t building under 200 000 said carl billera president of the greater lehigh valley realtors the realtors group does not collect raw inventory data for price points other than homes below 50 000 whose share of the market dropped from almost 8 percent in the beginning of 2016 to about 2 percent heading into 2019 according to the annual report to boot most properties below 120 000 are likely gobbled up quickly by investors looking to rent billera has observed the lack of inventory of moderately priced homes is where the choking point is around the country said lawrence yun chief economist at the national association of realtors nearly half of the new and existing homes that sold in the fourth quarter of 2018 were unaffordable for families earning the national median income of 71 900 the national association of home builders estimates compared with prerecession years builders are hardly building at all let alone building moderately priced housing fewer than 5 000 homes in the lehigh valley were built in the 2010s compared with more than 30 000 in the 2000s according to the u s census bureau data for lehigh and northampton counties from the department of housing and urban development show that the current number of residential building permits granted annually is about a 10th of what it was in 2005 the number of residential building permits granted in lehigh and northampton counties each year since 2001 i m seeing a decent amount of lots available but fewer builders that can afford to build in the lehigh valley because we re more price sensitive koze said as a result builders seem to be focused on a higher square footage said jeff scheuren president of fulton mortgage even when a builder sets out to bring a 250 000 home to market it doesn t always work out billera said increased regulations and a shortage of labor compared with before the recession make for an increasingly long time to finish construction he said so market conditions push the price above 300 000 by the time it s completed there s a lot of risk billera said i think they still feel the sting from when things went south in 2008 priced out that ideal 150 000 three bedroom that olmeda would like is more in range with what the lehigh valley labor market can afford said george lewis director of research and analysis for the lehigh valley economic development corp forget the fact that they re not being built anymore the existing housing stock also is out of touch with that range housing is something lvedc has not traditionally focused on lewis said but over the last two years the organization began to see affordability as central to the health of the region s labor market if we elevate the visibility of this issue our hope is that the market will respond he said the lvedc has gathered data from the council for community and economic research showing that the lehigh valley s cost of housing which includes rent has hovered consistently around 15 percentage points above the national average for the past three years and 20 points above in the third quarter of 2018 2018 was a wild year for housing prices which shot up by nearly 8 percent in lehigh and northampton counties alone according to glvr data and by 11 8 percent in the lehigh valley metropolitan area defined by the u s census which also includes carbon and warren counties according to a study of the top 100 u s metros by clear capital and kiplinger even the most prosperous areas won t see an 11 percent increase in income in one year lewis said in the five years before 2018 the average combined incomes in lehigh and northampton counties largely kept pace with home sales prices mean weighted incomes increased by 11 percent from 2012 to 2017 according to census data while average sales prices increased by about 12 percent according to data from the realtors group at this pace however it would take another five years for incomes to catch up to the recent increase in home prices nationally economists say it has felt tough for families to catch up particularly in the last five years a young family saving up for a down payment is trying to scrape here and there but realizing the down payment they ve saved up for has been increased again yun said rents in the lehigh valley have been consistently on the rise since 2015 according to data collected by the lvedc which show a current pace of 3 2 percent growth a year olmeda has been renting in schnecksville since 2016 after her previous townhome foreclosed for a six month period she had to care for her mother full time before finding a nursing home losing six months of paychecks she sees her paychecks getting eaten up every month by rent phone bills student loans medical bills and haircuts for her mother who has dementia she also has two daughters on part time incomes living with her saving up for any sort of down payment she said feels out of the question right now it s sort of discouraging to be at this age and scratching to make ends meet she said homeownership rates in the lehigh valley have slid downward since the recession especially among younger buyers homeownership trends in the lehigh valley from the great recession to the most recent census data available in bethlehem marc and jo yerrington 35 and 38 credit a particular set of circumstances that made it possible for them to transition into homeownership before moving to bethlehem in 2017 they lived taught and started their family in hong kong where their schools provided housing stipends and yearly bonuses that helped them pay down student debt they only spent a year renting in the lehigh valley before realizing the cost was unsustainable for their family of six there wasn t enough money left for groceries each month they landed their union boulevard home built in 1900 for 179 000 with the assistance of two first time homebuyer grants and without the impediment of student loan debt or years of local rent costs swallowing savings the only reason we could afford a house is because we lived in hong kong jo said we re still paycheck to paycheck but at least we can afford to eat the right mindset historically speaking housing affordability measures are better now than a generation ago yun likes to use 2000 for comparison it was a time period when the real estate market was considered boring he said at that time the index was 121 and the average 30 year fixed mortgage interest rate was 8 percent 2018 rounded out at an index of about 146 nationally mortgage rates are now at 4 6 percent credit conditions have eased for potential buyers since the financial crisis scheuren said but sellers could see these conditions as reason to put off selling and build more equity billera said maybe they recently refinanced at the historically low mortgage rates so they re waiting for the maximum possible return on investment plus in the inventory starved lehigh valley there aren t many places to go he s also seeing more homeowners and investors decide to rent their homes and become landlords rather than sell all of these behaviors contribute to a self reinforcing vicious cycle for the region s inventory a lot of it is people are being really conservative and they should be billera said looking up nationally 2019 is the first year in a long time in which incomes are projected to grow faster than home prices putting people in better position to buy a home yun said mortgage rates are also projected to stay low and flat this year he said scheuren s perception locally is that conditions are leveling off in the lehigh valley too the median listing price peaked in 2018 he s seeing fewer bidding wars and credit conditions have begun to ease anecdotally potential buyers are peeking back out of the woodwork said carol jurchenko a housing counselor with community action financial services i think people are just starting to gear up again and look she said 2018 marked the second year in a row that the number of plans approved for single family homes in lehigh and northampton counties notched up slightly from 420 in 2017 to 523 in 2018 according to the lehigh valley planning commission s annual buildlv report it s still too expensive to build affordably but at least lumber costs have come back down to normal levels and stabilized after last year s spike koze said rick koze ceo of kay builders stands in front of houses under construction at the indian creek community in emmaus in the fall i think after a couple years of pushing costs up they ve probably gone as much as they can go because of market conditions he said in the midst of the chaos of the last few years there s been one glaring constant demand particularly on the lower end of the housing market all parties involved are aware of the need with legislators looking at a bill to create a tax deductible first time homebuyers savings account program in pennsylvania people still want homes even if it means taking a longer time to get there but they could use a little help

the us economy slowed more than initially thought in the fourth quarter keeping growth in 2018 below the trump administration s 3 per cent target and corporate profits fell by the most in a year after a one off boost from lower taxes the economy is losing momentum as stimulus from the white house s 1 5 trillion in tax cuts and a government spending blitz diminishes it is also facing headwinds from slowing global growth washington s trade war with china and uncertainty over britain s departure from the european union the darkening clouds over the economy contributed to the federal reserve s decision last week to bring its three year campaign to tighten monetary policy to an abrupt end the us central bank abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018 the trend in quarterly growth is clearly on the wane said curt long chief economist at the national association of federally insured credit unions the strength of the labour market should be enough to postpone a recession for at least this year but the margins are getting smaller and it would not take much to tilt growth into negative territory slower growth gross domestic product increased at a 2 2 per cent annualised rate the commerce department said in its third reading of fourth quarter gdp growth on thursday that was down from the 2 6 per cent pace estimated in february the economy expanded at a 3 4 per cent pace in the third quarter for all of 2018 the economy grew 2 9 per cent as previously reported annual growth still missed the white house s 3 per cent target despite the massive fiscal stimulus growth last year was however the strongest since 2015 and was an acceleration from the 2 2 per cent logged in 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 gdp rose 3 0 per cent revised down from the 3 1 per cent reported last month president donald trump has pointed to the year on year growth figure as proof that the tax cuts which have contributed to a swelling of the federal government deficit have put the economy on a sustainable path of strong growth the commerce department s gdp release however highlighted the 2 9 per cent as the annual growth for 2018 trump likes to showcase the economy as one of the biggest achievements of his term declaring last july that his administration had accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions on the campaign trail trump boasted he could boost annual gdp growth to 4 per cent a goal analysts said was always unrealistic given low productivity among other factors three per cent growth is not that much different than 2 7 per cent in president barack obama s term so you can t brag too much said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york weak profits economists polled by reuters had forecast gdp in the fourth quarter being revised down to a 2 4 per cent pace the revisions to the fourth quarter reading reflected markdowns to consumer and business spending as well as government outlays and investment in home building exports were however revised up growth appears to have slowed even further early in the first quarter with retail sales rising modestly manufacturing production falling and home building tepid the softening economic outlook is seen helping to undercut profit growth which weakened in late 2018 after tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment which correspond to s p 500 profits fell at a 1 7 per cent rate or 34 2 billion in the fourth quarter that was the weakest pace since the fourth quarter of 2017 and followed a 0 9 per cent rise in the third quarter when measured from the income side the economy grew at a 1 7 per cent rate in the fourth quarter and 2 4 per cent in 2018 the deceleration in gdp growth this year will weigh on corporate profit growth while increased labor costs pose a threat to margins said jay bryson global economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte north carolina growth forecasts for the first quarter are as low as a 0 9 per cent rate us financial markets were little moved as investors weighed the weaker growth figures against some positive signs on us china trade talks strong labour market growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of us economic activity increased at a 2 5 per cent rate in the fourth quarter instead of the previously reported 2 8 per cent pace consumer spending remains underpinned by a strong labour market with a report from the labour department showing the number of americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a more than one month low last week growth in business spending on equipment and intellectual products was lowered the drop in residential construction outlays was deeper than previously reported and government spending actually contracted instead of expanding

it is a pleasure to address the manhattan institute s shadow open market committee somc today 1 the somc has long served as an important forum for debate regarding the appropriate stance of monetary policy debates that have often brought alternative perspectives to the challenges facing the federal open market committee fomc in the pursuit of its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices as allan meltzer wrote about his and karl brunner s founding of the somc our objective at the time and after was not just to complain about the results of policy actions we hoped also to improve policy discussion 2 this afternoon i will briefly remark on the economic outlook and the current stance of monetary policy and i would then like to devote some time to a discussion of the approach the federal reserve has taken on the setting of the countercyclical capital buffer ccyb and why i see a setting of 0 percent as recently affirmed by the board as the current appropriate setting for the ccyb also i will review some of the international experience with the ccyb given that the ccyb is a relatively new element of our regulatory toolkit the international experience has the potential to provide useful information on how the ccyb can be made most effective the economic outlook but first let me turn to the economic outlook at last week s meeting the fomc left the policy rate unchanged and reiterated its patient approach toward future policy adjustments 3 i supported this decision it is prudent at this point to watch the evolution of the incoming data in determining the appropriate stance of policy particularly given some indication that growth has slowed at least temporarily in the most recent data that said i remain optimistic about the outlook for the u s economy and i think that we have the potential to maintain growth at a healthy pace in the years ahead with regard to the recent data a sharp falloff in some retail sales measures in december suggested a slowing of consumption the mainstay component of aggregate demand while i would not suggest ignoring this decline it does seem rather inconsistent with a number of other indicators including the continued strength of the labor market and wage gains in recent months and the labor market does remain strong even with a weak reading in february the three month average gain in payrolls at 186 000 remains above most estimates of the pace of job gains needed to maintain downward pressure on an already historically low unemployment rate as with retail sales the february payroll number seems a bit odd especially when measured against the continued strength of the household survey for the same month that said weak february payrolls are another reason to continue patiently watching the data to see how economic conditions evolve looking past the near term data i see many reasons to expect relatively strong growth in the coming years supported by gains in the productive capacity of the economy regarding the inputs of production i have been encouraged by the increase in labor force participation over the past year after a period of subdued growth investment was also strong last year with spending on equipment and intangibles rising 7 1 2 percent increasing the capital stock and adding to the productive potential of the economy though some recent investment indicators have been less robust these data are volatile and i expect continued gains supported by profit growth continuing impetus from incentives in the tax bill and a generally favorable business environment most important i have been encouraged by the recent step up in labor productivity growth last year s increase of almost 2 percent marked the strongest growth since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis and was well above the 1 percent pace that prevailed in the preceding five years i think there are many reasons to believe that this faster productivity growth could be persistent my expectation for further increases in capital spending is one for another it could be that tight labor markets have played a role in boosting labor productivity growth as employers work to increase efficiency as new workers become harder to find turning to inflation given the volatility and idiosyncrasies of the data i view the current reading on core pce personal consumption expenditures inflation at 1 8 percent as being roughly consistent with our 2 percent objective overall inflation pressures are muted but i do not believe that the seeming unresponsiveness of inflation to the apparent tightness of the labor market and other aspects of the economy tells the whole story in evaluating slack versus constraint in the economy of the many explanations for this phenomenon that have been offered one possibility that we have to keep in mind is that inflation has remained stable precisely because of the public s confidence that the fed will maintain a framework that keeps the economy from overheating and inflation from rising significantly above the 2 percent benchmark inflation could then for some time remain quite stable in the face of an economy running hot but if public confidence began to erode because of fed inaction a possible consequence could be the de anchoring of inflation expectations rather than a gradual and controlled move to an inflation rate sustainably around our 2 percent goal of course there are a variety of alternative explanations for the current surprising relationship between inflation and unemployment and perhaps all of them are part of a full account we should also be wary of a material and durable downward drift in inflation expectations below our objective were we to see that develop perhaps due to secular changes in the formation of prices or perceived constraints on the ability of monetary policy to react to future downturns either way as a matter of prudent risk management we must conduct policy in a manner consistent with keeping inflation near target validating the public s trust in our commitment to our inflation objective and keeping inflation expectations anchored in regard to policy i am very comfortable remaining patient at this point and monitoring the incoming data that said my sense is that further increases in the policy rate may be necessary at some point a stance i believe is consistent with my optimistic view of the economy s growth potential and momentum in the language of central banking my estimate of the neutral policy rate remains somewhat north of where we are now communicating a data dependent policy framework can be challenging especially if we do not want to appear to be overly discretionary it would probably be clearest if we defined what data we are dependent on and how we depended on those data that is to say if we adopted a monetary policy rule strict rules however to achieve their valuable heuristic benefit are as much about ignoring some data as they are about paying attention to other specific data indeed while rules provide useful and important benchmarks the complexity and evolving nature of the economy at the current juncture argue for the consideration of a wide range of indicators in assessing the state of that economy this in turn can complicate the communication of data dependence how can we adopt and convey a clear strategic stance on policy while maintaining our credibility if evolution of the data requires an evolution of that strategy i prefer a framework where we make it clear that we are focused on broad trends elsewhere i have used the aviation analogy that we should not chase the needles on the instrument panel we should be clear that while we will respond to clear and durable evolution in these broad trends we are not reacting to every piece of volatile data 4 the countercyclical capital buffer and financial stability let me now shift gears and return to the ccyb beginning with how it fits within our broad set of efforts to promote financial stability the core of that approach has been to establish a set of structural through the cycle regulatory and supervisory standards to ensure resilience against a broad range of shocks in contrast to the pre crisis framework banks especially the largest and most systemic banks are now required to maintain substantially higher and higher quality loss absorbing capital and other cushions stress testing examines the resilience of large banks to severely adverse economic conditions liquidity requirements and regulatory incentives to limit reliance on short term wholesale funding have reduced funding risk among large banks and their affiliated broker dealers and resolution planning requirements reduce the risks that the failure of a large firm would spill into the broader economy outside of the banking system money market mutual fund reform has reduced this sector s susceptibility to destabilizing runs by investors and requirements that many derivatives be centrally cleared have decreased the opacity and interconnectedness that contributed to the chaos of 2008 in addition to these through the cycle measures the federal reserve actively monitors for the buildup of financial stability vulnerabilities and can require large banks to increase their loss absorbing capacity through increases in the ccyb when systemic vulnerabilities are sufficiently large while such countercyclical tools are new their goal is to mitigate the buildup of vulnerabilities during buoyant periods since experience has proven time and again that vulnerabilities can build during good times as risk appetite grows and memories of earlier instability fade effectively mitigating the buildup of risk through the ccyb requires a systematic framework for analyzing vulnerabilities and a mapping of such changes in financial sector risks into the appropriate level for the ccyb the board developed its framework outlining the objectives of the tool and the factors that would influence the determination of its appropriate level through a process of public consultation 5 under our policy the primary objective for activating the ccyb is to build financial sector resilience during periods when the risks to financial stability have risen to meaningfully above normal levels and there is an elevated possibility of potential losses within the banking sector that could place strains on the supply of credit or otherwise substantially impede economic and financial activity a secondary objective for using the ccyb is its potential to limit the buildup of financial vulnerabilities by slowing the rate of credit expansion that is the possibility that the ccyb may lean against the wind of credit fluctuations this secondary objective both in the original basel discussions and in the federal reserve s framework is less central a notable feature of the board s current framework is the decision to maintain a 0 percent ccyb when vulnerabilities are within their normal range because we set high through the cycle capital requirements in the united states that provide substantial resilience to normal fluctuations in economic and financial conditions it is appropriate to set the ccyb at zero in a normal risk environment thus our presumption has been that the ccyb would be zero most of the time current assessment of financial vulnerabilities when then would it be appropriate given this framework to activate the ccyb that is how do we know when financial vulnerabilities are elevated the federal reserve continuously monitors vulnerabilities as highlighted in our recent financial stability report 6 our approach is organized around tracking four broad vulnerabilities that academic research and practical experience have shown can amplify negative shocks and result in outsized losses in the real economy these are asset valuation pressures household and business debt funding risk and financial sector leverage as part of this process the board considers a number of quantitative indicators one of which is the credit to gdp gross domestic product gap proposed in the basel committee guidance that are indicative of potential vulnerabilities nonetheless judgment must play an important role in this process especially in assessing how interactions between vulnerabilities may serve to mute or amplify the transmission of different kinds of shocks the framework requires further judgment as to whether the ccyb is the most appropriate tool to address the particular areas of concern which will depend on among other things the extent to which banks subject to the ccyb are exposed to vulnerabilities or contributing to them assessing the current state of financial vulnerabilities is thus a critical part of the decision on whether to activate the ccyb let me briefly give you my view of each of the four categories in turn asset valuations increased to the high end of their historical ranges in many markets over 2017 and the first half of 2018 supported by the solid economic expansion and an apparent increase in investors appetite for risk the market volatility and subsequent rebound have muddied the picture somewhat however it does seem that valuation pressures have eased to some extent in a particular locus of concern the market for leveraged loans that is syndicated loans to lower rated or unrated borrowers with already significant debt loads now regarding debt outstanding borrowing by businesses has reached a historically high level relative to the size of the economy or business assets and there are also signs of deteriorating underwriting standards of course this has happened at a time when corporate profits relative to the size of the economy are also quite high mitigating some of the concern this might suggest but the riskiest forms of business debt have increased the most amid such signs these developments could potentially leave the corporate sector vulnerable to a sharp slowing in economic growth although we think the banking sector has only limited direct exposures to such borrowers and to the extent they can be measured indirect exposures are also limited the notable levels of vulnerability in asset valuation pressures and business borrowing must be considered alongside modest vulnerabilities associated with household borrowing and the historically low levels of financial sector leverage and funding risk household debt relative to gdp has fallen substantially from the level of a decade ago and the credit quality of household borrowing remains relatively solid despite pockets of weakness evident in some areas of auto lending even more important banks now have substantially higher quality capital and more of it than in the 2000s owing importantly to the structural reform of capital requirements and stress testing in fact under last year s stress tests capital levels at the largest u s banks after a hypothetical severe global recession would have been higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years before the crisis moreover around 20 percent of the assets of the most systemically important financial institutions are highly liquid assets that can be sold quickly in the event of stress and following reforms to money market mutual funds and other steps the volume of short term uninsured funding most prone to runs is well below pre crisis levels taken as a whole financial system vulnerabilities strike me as being not outside their normal range which is consistent with a zero ccyb under the board s framework and is why i supported the board s decision to keep the ccyb at zero earlier this month international experience with the countercyclical capital buffer while policymakers in the united states have maintained the ccyb at zero since 2016 other countries have adjusted their countercyclical buffers in response to vulnerabilities within their financial sectors currently 13 countries have announced a ccyb above zero ranging from 0 25 percent in luxembourg to 2 5 percent in hong kong norway and sweden 7 the ccyb is a novel approach to financial regulation and i think it is important that we as regulators learn from other countries experiences with the ccyb i see three important explanations for differences in the ccyb across countries perhaps the most important and direct reason for different ccyb levels among different countries is that they face different vulnerabilities according to national authorities announcements the decisions to activate the buffers were generally motivated by credit growth household debt and housing prices in this regard it is notable that mortgage credit or house prices have expanded rapidly in several countries deploying the ccyb including hong kong and the nordic countries that have set their ccyb at 2 5 percent for example the hong kong monetary authority s decision to increase the ccyb level to 2 5 percent in january 2018 was importantly linked to housing developments another explanation for the differences in observed ccyb levels across countries is the range of available macroprudential tools to stem the buildup in financial vulnerabilities in different countries and the degree to which such tools have been the preferred means for addressing identified vulnerabilities 8 for example housing market booms as noted above for hong kong have been a concern in several countries in recent years 9 accordingly some national authorities have used macroprudential tools focused on housing such as caps on loan to value ratios to try to increase the resilience of borrowers and to indirectly strengthen the resilience of the banks and the financial system should their housing booms turn to busts for example policymakers in canada have not activated the ccyb in response to concerns about housing market risks but they have lowered the maximum loan to value ratio for various mortgage products and capped debt service to income ratios 10 the availability of such alternative tools for limiting systemic risk may be among the factors influencing the decision to adjust or not adjust the ccyb in a number of countries in this regard it is notable that the set of macroprudential tools in the united states is limited relative to that in many other countries 11 finally another difference one that is particular to the united kingdom is the framework adopted by the u k financial policy committee fpc to integrate the ccyb with its structural capital requirements specifically under the fpc s framework the ccyb would equal 1 percent in standard risk conditions but to avoid having this be a significant increase to already very high levels of capital the fpc undertook a one time adjustment to its other capital buffers in order to offset part of this increase the effect of the policy is that the buffer can be varied both up and down in line with the changing risks that the banking system faces over time this approach is an interesting deviation from the idea in the original basel discussions and the framework adopted in many other jurisdictions in which structural capital requirements are set at levels aimed to deliver the desired level of resilience with the ccyb raised to positive values only at times when vulnerabilities are above normal in practice the u k framework appears to have provided the fpc with additional flexibility as it has adjusted the ccyb with evolving financial risks associated with for example brexit as i examine this experience systems similar to the united kingdom s where the ccyb is positive during normal times may allow policymakers to react more quickly to economic financial or even geopolitical shocks that occur amid otherwise normal conditions without relying on the slow moving credit aggregates contemplated in the original basel proposal moreover this setting of the ccyb permits more gradual adjustments in the ccyb especially in periods with a high degree of uncertainty about the level of financial vulnerabilities another possible benefit of a system that has additional flexibility is the ability to coordinate the setting of the ccyb with the setting of monetary policy in situations where such coordination is valuable at the same time i would not expect such situations to be the norm as the objectives and governance of monetary policy and macroprudential policies are separate for good reasons conclusion in the united states we have built a substantially safer financial system by focusing on using structural tools that confer through the cycle resilience with that construction work largely behind us attention naturally turns to the set of time varying financial regulations particularly the ccyb the overall capital framework in the united states has been designed to ensure high capital levels without having to activate the ccyb with the implication being that the bar for activation would be a high one but as a result much of the time there would not be any buffer to reduce if conditions were to precipitously deteriorate the united kingdom s approach to setting the ccyb also relies on having a high overall level of capital during normal times but by swapping some portion of static capital for ccyb in reaching that high capital level during normal times and thus making some of that capital part of a releasable buffer u k policymakers have built in more flexibility to move buffers down in times of stress other countries provide additional data points in terms of possible ways of approaching the ccyb with the ccyb in active use around the world i am confident that the academic and policy communities will learn a great deal about how best to use this new tool to build a more resilient

reforms that will be implemented as of april by the economy administration and coordinated by the treasury and finance ministry as mentioned in previous articles will focus on areas to increase our real sector s capability for action in terms of cost management in other words areas where we can make our exporters stronger in global competition in addition to a brand new tax architecture to ease the burden on the real sector and increase its maneuverability and a new financial architecture bolstered by a deepened capital market to allow the real sector to reach a broader scheme of financing in better conditions a new procurement architecture will reward firms that manufacture and export domestic raw materials and intermediate products when you combine these steps with a whole new human resources architecture focused on productivity turkey can become the most attractive investment center in eurasia economies capture sustainability on 3 basic pillars stability in growth and development price stability and financial stability one of the important elements to ensure the relationship between these three pillars is that turkey is perceived as an investable country by domestic and foreign economic actors for fixed capital investments to steadily continue continuity of fixed capital investments brings growth development and employment and increases price stability with increased production financial stability ensures the continuity of fixed capital investments since financial stability supports the real sector with 360 degree inclusivity with sufficiently deepened financial markets banking capital insurance private pension leasing consumer financing and factoring markets for treasury and finance minister albayrak these aspects can make istanbul an international finance service and design center for the region thus he is drafting and coordinating new strategies to make turkey a center of attraction in agriculture manufacturing wholesale and retail trade transportation logistics and software investment with the world struggling with so many regional and global economic and political tensions we will be able to increasingly safeguard our country from this by making turkey an attractive investment center phase synchronization exchange rate manipulation in economic science the position of phase difference and phase effect in macroeconomic analysis is an important topic of discussion among academics the extent of delay in the reflection of developments contraction and expansion observed in the turkish and global economy on macroeconomic balances and similarly the extent to which measures taken by the economic administrations of countries will be reflected by a delay on macroeconomic balances are important areas of analysis while economists cannot fully agree on this issue among themselves the fact that analysts of banks financial institutions and ratings agencies have findings comments and claims about a country s macroeconomic balances the value of the country s currency inflation and its current account balance with such certainty would be considered technical arrogance in academia from india to russia from brazil to south africa from china to australia from indonesia to mexico from argentina to france from canada to turkey we can find thousands of examples of these reports that tend toward the level of technical arrogance stepping out of line even approaching manipulation and crossing the red lines of regulatory institutions fines that the u s securities and exchange commission sec has levied for biased intentional technical errors of analysts over the last 19 years ranges from 1 4 billion to 50 million jerry w markham s a financial history of the united states is exemplary countries whose money and capital markets are regulated by important rule making institutions and that are managed by regulatory institutions such as a banking regulation and supervision agency and or governing bodies such as a capital markets board with regards to the possibility of causing manipulation question reports that exceed their aim limit or include technical arrogance coordinated by the ministry of treasury and finance the positive impact of measures implemented by economic management with regard to growth employment and price exchange rate stability is a matter of phase synchronization while economic management which defends this fundamental point indicates each month when compared to the previous month the balancing and normalization of the economy will gradually increase and expand to a positive state from june onward with the phase effect ambitious analyses that include technical arrogance towards inflation interest rates and exchange rates before seeing the data for april and may would increase discussions of manipulation for a field that should be meticulously approached to summarize it is part of the natural process to invite and expect financial institutions to work based more on ethical codes and more diligently
switching to a no tax or moderately taxed regime has helped many countries turn their economies around and become economic powerhouses it has been a long time when this historical event took place but the old timers among us may recall the sensation created in 1975 when late king birendra announced to the international community his proposal of nepal to be recognized as zone of peace he asked the country s foreign missions to work vigorously with their host countries to push the united nations to declare nepal a zone of peace country reportedly some 130 countries accepted this proposal excepting principally india that chose to stay out of it meaning that it didn t approve or disapprove of the proposal in the absence of india s support the enthusiasm for zone of peace proposal weathered over the years and was discarded when the absolute monarchy ended in 1990 tax free zone a different kind of zone proposal can now be considered for nepal many times more advantageous than the peace zone whose objective will be to make nepal a tax free territory since governments must raise revenue to meet expenditures tax free proposal is implemented on a selective basis choosing just income and profit taxes and in some case trade taxes assessed on exports and imports like any other country for nepal to become a tax free zone will involve a large size loss of tax revenue from income and trade taxes which using the revenue data from budget of fiscal 2018 2019 amounts to close to half of total tax revenue of rs 838 billion it is then unrealistic for the government to have to adjust budget spending to offset this large size loss of revenue by switching to a tax free economy but there can be a route for a safe landing implementing the proposal in a way that doesn t destabilize the country s finances or forces it to run deficit and pile up huge amounts of debt the issue of loss of revenue then needs to be considered in a more realistic way that should include the dynamic impact of relaxing and eliminating the tax burden by reducing or eliminating some selective taxes looking at the current situation nepal has one of the highest tax rates among low income countries rates that hurt incentives reduce work effort and discourage trading across the border nepal s high tax regime the incentive issue relates to what economists call the taxation of capital and of income earned by individuals capital taxes are assessed mainly from profits and dividends earned from investments and collected from industrial and business enterprises currently tax rate on business profits is a flat 30 percent but adding other charges on corporate profit the rate goes up to 45 percent a rate at the top of that charged by many other countries compared to nepal s neighbors bangladesh bhutan and india all have 35 percent or lower corporate tax rate and further india and bangladesh provide better infrastructure and a more robust culture of aiding business growth than nepal does on the world bank s doing business index for example nepal ranks 110 among the countries compared to a much superior rating at 77 for india which indicates a much more business friendly environment looking at the tax paid on individual incomes very few exemptions are allowed in nepal and particularly the highest marginal rate rises to 50 percent that applies to incomes considered low by international standards and again this rate kicks in at a much lower income level than the case in neighboring countries that have highest marginal rate of 30 percent or lower economic impact few studies have been done to assess the impact of high income and profit tax rates on investment and economic growth but the cost in terms of loss of incentives must be substantial at the present time some rs 220 billion is collected annually in income taxes individual and business combined this amounts to a fourth of total tax revenue and eight percent of gdp can this amount of revenue be collected if individual and corporate income taxes are lowered to revenue by a flat rate of five or 10 percent or eliminated altogether and more generally how does a low or no tax regime impact the economy we can argue that at least part of the income saved from reduced income tax payment will be spent on purchases of goods and services that now pay 13 percent vat but this can be raised to 20 percent if the income tax is lowered or eliminated if then just half of the equivalent of income and profit tax revenue of rs 218 billion gets spent on the purchase of goods and services as much as an extra rs 25 billion can be collected just from the vat also the revenue from indirectly taxed items other than vat will increase by may be a similar amount looking at a more dynamic scenario emerging from a tax free economy that takes into account the impact on business decisions and on individual incentives there is room for the economy to expand and generate an extra one to two percent growth than in a tax loaded economy this scenario then justifies the expectation of a tax cut paying for itself a premise advocated by conservative economists and politicians in the united states this theory of income tax can be expanded to reducing or eliminating border taxes that have been historically an important source for nepal s revenue border tax revenue has escalated many folds over the past decade as remittance money has become an important source of income for the general population much of which gets spent on purchase of imported goods the increase in import volumes along with a determined effort to collect a maximum amount from import taxes and usually the high tax rates charged on imported food electronic items transport machinery and parts soft drinks and alcoholic beverages have made the import tax revenue highly income elastic with growth in this category of revenue rising more than twice the collection from non import taxes has helped turn this revenue source more income elastic than revenues from income and profit taxes again just like the case of income tax heavy taxation of border trade can have adverse effects on the economy in many ways first it tends to raise the cost of living that takes away part of incomes of general population and also that import taxes are regressive with its burden falling disproportionately on low income families second high import and export taxes as well as high excise taxes make the economy less competitive by raising the cost of domestic production third import taxes tend to worsen the income inequality in the population because of generally inelastic demands for essential consumer items on which low income families spend a much larger portion of their income than upper income families fourth and finally heavy taxation of imports tends to lower the quality of locally produced substitutes smaller varieties of goods are available in the market and a shortage economy tends to encourage black market activities low tax choice looking at the prospects of a heavily vs moderately taxed economy there is almost no evidence to suggest that a heavily taxed economy ever becomes an economic success story for the reason that taxes at high levels destroy incentives and feed on corruption on the contrary switching to a no tax or moderately taxed regime has helped many countries turn their economies around and become economic powerhouses by anchoring their growth to comparative advantage and to competitive trading that helps take on the monopolies transition to a globalized market place has then been a natural outcome for local businesses to partner with multinational companies share their most up to date technology copy their product design and secure easy access to expanded market opportunities this in a nutshell is the singapore story for nepal to emulate and become a success story finally finance minister yuba raj khatiwada has declared that investment summit 2019 underway in kathmandu now will be instrumental to steer country towards the path of development however this type of hope and vision is not as well founded as the one focused on effort to move the country to become a tax free or a moderately taxed economy my best hope from the summit like this is that foreign guests will spend generously on purchases of goods and services produced in nepal which in the least will have a positive value added effect on the economy to lift its growth and increase income levels the author teaches economics at nova college virginia sshah1083 hotmail com

it is a pleasure to address the manhattan institute s shadow open market committee somc today 1 the somc has long served as an important forum for debate regarding the appropriate stance of monetary policy debates that have often brought alternative perspectives to the challenges facing the federal open market committee fomc in the pursuit of its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices as allan meltzer wrote about his and karl brunner s founding of the somc our objective at the time and after was not just to complain about the results of policy actions we hoped also to improve policy discussion 2 this afternoon i will briefly remark on the economic outlook and the current stance of monetary policy and i would then like to devote some time to a discussion of the approach the federal reserve has taken on the setting of the countercyclical capital buffer ccyb and why i see a setting of 0 percent as recently affirmed by the board as the current appropriate setting for the ccyb also i will review some of the international experience with the ccyb given that the ccyb is a relatively new element of our regulatory toolkit the international experience has the potential to provide useful information on how the ccyb can be made most effective the economic outlook but first let me turn to the economic outlook at last week s meeting the fomc left the policy rate unchanged and reiterated its patient approach toward future policy adjustments 3 i supported this decision it is prudent at this point to watch the evolution of the incoming data in determining the appropriate stance of policy particularly given some indication that growth has slowed at least temporarily in the most recent data that said i remain optimistic about the outlook for the u s economy and i think that we have the potential to maintain growth at a healthy pace in the years ahead with regard to the recent data a sharp falloff in some retail sales measures in december suggested a slowing of consumption the mainstay component of aggregate demand while i would not suggest ignoring this decline it does seem rather inconsistent with a number of other indicators including the continued strength of the labor market and wage gains in recent months and the labor market does remain strong even with a weak reading in february the three month average gain in payrolls at 186 000 remains above most estimates of the pace of job gains needed to maintain downward pressure on an already historically low unemployment rate as with retail sales the february payroll number seems a bit odd especially when measured against the continued strength of the household survey for the same month that said weak february payrolls are another reason to continue patiently watching the data to see how economic conditions evolve looking past the near term data i see many reasons to expect relatively strong growth in the coming years supported by gains in the productive capacity of the economy regarding the inputs of production i have been encouraged by the increase in labor force participation over the past year after a period of subdued growth investment was also strong last year with spending on equipment and intangibles rising 7 1 2 percent increasing the capital stock and adding to the productive potential of the economy though some recent investment indicators have been less robust these data are volatile and i expect continued gains supported by profit growth continuing impetus from incentives in the tax bill and a generally favorable business environment most important i have been encouraged by the recent step up in labor productivity growth last year s increase of almost 2 percent marked the strongest growth since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis and was well above the 1 percent pace that prevailed in the preceding five years i think there are many reasons to believe that this faster productivity growth could be persistent my expectation for further increases in capital spending is one for another it could be that tight labor markets have played a role in boosting labor productivity growth as employers work to increase efficiency as new workers become harder to find turning to inflation given the volatility and idiosyncrasies of the data i view the current reading on core pce personal consumption expenditures inflation at 1 8 percent as being roughly consistent with our 2 percent objective overall inflation pressures are muted but i do not believe that the seeming unresponsiveness of inflation to the apparent tightness of the labor market and other aspects of the economy tells the whole story in evaluating slack versus constraint in the economy of the many explanations for this phenomenon that have been offered one possibility that we have to keep in mind is that inflation has remained stable precisely because of the public s confidence that the fed will maintain a framework that keeps the economy from overheating and inflation from rising significantly above the 2 percent benchmark inflation could then for some time remain quite stable in the face of an economy running hot but if public confidence began to erode because of fed inaction a possible consequence could be the de anchoring of inflation expectations rather than a gradual and controlled move to an inflation rate sustainably around our 2 percent goal of course there are a variety of alternative explanations for the current surprising relationship between inflation and unemployment and perhaps all of them are part of a full account we should also be wary of a material and durable downward drift in inflation expectations below our objective were we to see that develop perhaps due to secular changes in the formation of prices or perceived constraints on the ability of monetary policy to react to future downturns either way as a matter of prudent risk management we must conduct policy in a manner consistent with keeping inflation near target validating the public s trust in our commitment to our inflation objective and keeping inflation expectations anchored in regard to policy i am very comfortable remaining patient at this point and monitoring the incoming data that said my sense is that further increases in the policy rate may be necessary at some point a stance i believe is consistent with my optimistic view of the economy s growth potential and momentum in the language of central banking my estimate of the neutral policy rate remains somewhat north of where we are now communicating a data dependent policy framework can be challenging especially if we do not want to appear to be overly discretionary it would probably be clearest if we defined what data we are dependent on and how we depended on those data that is to say if we adopted a monetary policy rule strict rules however to achieve their valuable heuristic benefit are as much about ignoring some data as they are about paying attention to other specific data indeed while rules provide useful and important benchmarks the complexity and evolving nature of the economy at the current juncture argue for the consideration of a wide range of indicators in assessing the state of that economy this in turn can complicate the communication of data dependence how can we adopt and convey a clear strategic stance on policy while maintaining our credibility if evolution of the data requires an evolution of that strategy i prefer a framework where we make it clear that we are focused on broad trends elsewhere i have used the aviation analogy that we should not chase the needles on the instrument panel we should be clear that while we will respond to clear and durable evolution in these broad trends we are not reacting to every piece of volatile data 4 the countercyclical capital buffer and financial stability let me now shift gears and return to the ccyb beginning with how it fits within our broad set of efforts to promote financial stability the core of that approach has been to establish a set of structural through the cycle regulatory and supervisory standards to ensure resilience against a broad range of shocks in contrast to the pre crisis framework banks especially the largest and most systemic banks are now required to maintain substantially higher and higher quality loss absorbing capital and other cushions stress testing examines the resilience of large banks to severely adverse economic conditions liquidity requirements and regulatory incentives to limit reliance on short term wholesale funding have reduced funding risk among large banks and their affiliated broker dealers and resolution planning requirements reduce the risks that the failure of a large firm would spill into the broader economy outside of the banking system money market mutual fund reform has reduced this sector s susceptibility to destabilizing runs by investors and requirements that many derivatives be centrally cleared have decreased the opacity and interconnectedness that contributed to the chaos of 2008 in addition to these through the cycle measures the federal reserve actively monitors for the buildup of financial stability vulnerabilities and can require large banks to increase their loss absorbing capacity through increases in the ccyb when systemic vulnerabilities are sufficiently large while such countercyclical tools are new their goal is to mitigate the buildup of vulnerabilities during buoyant periods since experience has proven time and again that vulnerabilities can build during good times as risk appetite grows and memories of earlier instability fade effectively mitigating the buildup of risk through the ccyb requires a systematic framework for analyzing vulnerabilities and a mapping of such changes in financial sector risks into the appropriate level for the ccyb the board developed its framework outlining the objectives of the tool and the factors that would influence the determination of its appropriate level through a process of public consultation 5 under our policy the primary objective for activating the ccyb is to build financial sector resilience during periods when the risks to financial stability have risen to meaningfully above normal levels and there is an elevated possibility of potential losses within the banking sector that could place strains on the supply of credit or otherwise substantially impede economic and financial activity a secondary objective for using the ccyb is its potential to limit the buildup of financial vulnerabilities by slowing the rate of credit expansion that is the possibility that the ccyb may lean against the wind of credit fluctuations this secondary objective both in the original basel discussions and in the federal reserve s framework is less central a notable feature of the board s current framework is the decision to maintain a 0 percent ccyb when vulnerabilities are within their normal range because we set high through the cycle capital requirements in the united states that provide substantial resilience to normal fluctuations in economic and financial conditions it is appropriate to set the ccyb at zero in a normal risk environment thus our presumption has been that the ccyb would be zero most of the time current assessment of financial vulnerabilities when then would it be appropriate given this framework to activate the ccyb that is how do we know when financial vulnerabilities are elevated the federal reserve continuously monitors vulnerabilities as highlighted in our recent financial stability report 6 our approach is organized around tracking four broad vulnerabilities that academic research and practical experience have shown can amplify negative shocks and result in outsized losses in the real economy these are asset valuation pressures household and business debt funding risk and financial sector leverage as part of this process the board considers a number of quantitative indicators one of which is the credit to gdp gross domestic product gap proposed in the basel committee guidance that are indicative of potential vulnerabilities nonetheless judgment must play an important role in this process especially in assessing how interactions between vulnerabilities may serve to mute or amplify the transmission of different kinds of shocks the framework requires further judgment as to whether the ccyb is the most appropriate tool to address the particular areas of concern which will depend on among other things the extent to which banks subject to the ccyb are exposed to vulnerabilities or contributing to them assessing the current state of financial vulnerabilities is thus a critical part of the decision on whether to activate the ccyb let me briefly give you my view of each of the four categories in turn asset valuations increased to the high end of their historical ranges in many markets over 2017 and the first half of 2018 supported by the solid economic expansion and an apparent increase in investors appetite for risk the market volatility and subsequent rebound have muddied the picture somewhat however it does seem that valuation pressures have eased to some extent in a particular locus of concern the market for leveraged loans that is syndicated loans to lower rated or unrated borrowers with already significant debt loads now regarding debt outstanding borrowing by businesses has reached a historically high level relative to the size of the economy or business assets and there are also signs of deteriorating underwriting standards of course this has happened at a time when corporate profits relative to the size of the economy are also quite high mitigating some of the concern this might suggest but the riskiest forms of business debt have increased the most amid such signs these developments could potentially leave the corporate sector vulnerable to a sharp slowing in economic growth although we think the banking sector has only limited direct exposures to such borrowers and to the extent they can be measured indirect exposures are also limited the notable levels of vulnerability in asset valuation pressures and business borrowing must be considered alongside modest vulnerabilities associated with household borrowing and the historically low levels of financial sector leverage and funding risk household debt relative to gdp has fallen substantially from the level of a decade ago and the credit quality of household borrowing remains relatively solid despite pockets of weakness evident in some areas of auto lending even more important banks now have substantially higher quality capital and more of it than in the 2000s owing importantly to the structural reform of capital requirements and stress testing in fact under last year s stress tests capital levels at the largest u s banks after a hypothetical severe global recession would have been higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years before the crisis moreover around 20 percent of the assets of the most systemically important financial institutions are highly liquid assets that can be sold quickly in the event of stress and following reforms to money market mutual funds and other steps the volume of short term uninsured funding most prone to runs is well below pre crisis levels taken as a whole financial system vulnerabilities strike me as being not outside their normal range which is consistent with a zero ccyb under the board s framework and is why i supported the board s decision to keep the ccyb at zero earlier this month international experience with the countercyclical capital buffer while policymakers in the united states have maintained the ccyb at zero since 2016 other countries have adjusted their countercyclical buffers in response to vulnerabilities within their financial sectors currently 13 countries have announced a ccyb above zero ranging from 0 25 percent in luxembourg to 2 5 percent in hong kong norway and sweden 7 the ccyb is a novel approach to financial regulation and i think it is important that we as regulators learn from other countries experiences with the ccyb i see three important explanations for differences in the ccyb across countries perhaps the most important and direct reason for different ccyb levels among different countries is that they face different vulnerabilities according to national authorities announcements the decisions to activate the buffers were generally motivated by credit growth household debt and housing prices in this regard it is notable that mortgage credit or house prices have expanded rapidly in several countries deploying the ccyb including hong kong and the nordic countries that have set their ccyb at 2 5 percent for example the hong kong monetary authority s decision to increase the ccyb level to 2 5 percent in january 2018 was importantly linked to housing developments another explanation for the differences in observed ccyb levels across countries is the range of available macroprudential tools to stem the buildup in financial vulnerabilities in different countries and the degree to which such tools have been the preferred means for addressing identified vulnerabilities 8 for example housing market booms as noted above for hong kong have been a concern in several countries in recent years 9 accordingly some national authorities have used macroprudential tools focused on housing such as caps on loan to value ratios to try to increase the resilience of borrowers and to indirectly strengthen the resilience of the banks and the financial system should their housing booms turn to busts for example policymakers in canada have not activated the ccyb in response to concerns about housing market risks but they have lowered the maximum loan to value ratio for various mortgage products and capped debt service to income ratios 10 the availability of such alternative tools for limiting systemic risk may be among the factors influencing the decision to adjust or not adjust the ccyb in a number of countries in this regard it is notable that the set of macroprudential tools in the united states is limited relative to that in many other countries 11 finally another difference one that is particular to the united kingdom is the framework adopted by the u k financial policy committee fpc to integrate the ccyb with its structural capital requirements specifically under the fpc s framework the ccyb would equal 1 percent in standard risk conditions but to avoid having this be a significant increase to already very high levels of capital the fpc undertook a one time adjustment to its other capital buffers in order to offset part of this increase the effect of the policy is that the buffer can be varied both up and down in line with the changing risks that the banking system faces over time this approach is an interesting deviation from the idea in the original basel discussions and the framework adopted in many other jurisdictions in which structural capital requirements are set at levels aimed to deliver the desired level of resilience with the ccyb raised to positive values only at times when vulnerabilities are above normal in practice the u k framework appears to have provided the fpc with additional flexibility as it has adjusted the ccyb with evolving financial risks associated with for example brexit as i examine this experience systems similar to the united kingdom s where the ccyb is positive during normal times may allow policymakers to react more quickly to economic financial or even geopolitical shocks that occur amid otherwise normal conditions without relying on the slow moving credit aggregates contemplated in the original basel proposal moreover this setting of the ccyb permits more gradual adjustments in the ccyb especially in periods with a high degree of uncertainty about the level of financial vulnerabilities another possible benefit of a system that has additional flexibility is the ability to coordinate the setting of the ccyb with the setting of monetary policy in situations where such coordination is valuable at the same time i would not expect such situations to be the norm as the objectives and governance of monetary policy and macroprudential policies are separate for good reasons conclusion in the united states we have built a substantially safer financial system by focusing on using structural tools that confer through the cycle resilience with that construction work largely behind us attention naturally turns to the set of time varying financial regulations particularly the ccyb the overall capital framework in the united states has been designed to ensure high capital levels without having to activate the ccyb with the implication being that the bar for activation would be a high one but as a result much of the time there would not be any buffer to reduce if conditions were to precipitously deteriorate the united kingdom s approach to setting the ccyb also relies on having a high overall level of capital during normal times but by swapping some portion of static capital for ccyb in reaching that high capital level during normal times and thus making some of that capital part of a releasable buffer u k policymakers have built in more flexibility to move buffers down in times of stress other countries provide additional data points in terms of possible ways of approaching the ccyb with the ccyb in active use around the world i am confident that the academic and policy communities will learn a great deal about how best to use this new tool to build a more resilient

with low unemployment to him the probability of recession this year or next was not elevated relative to any year he also downplayed the significance of yield curve inversion he added there s a lot of reasons to think that it has been a recession predictor for reasons in the past that kind of don t apply today and it only telling us that growth will be pretty modest on monetary policy williams said short term interest rate is around neutral meanwhile any development in the economy whether it s on the employment side or on the inflation side that moved in a persistent way away from our objectives one way or the other would be a reason to rethink the path of policy going forward fed bullard weak data probably temporary premature to contemplate rate cut st louis fed president james bullard said overnight that the spate of weaker data is probably mostly temporary and the notion of a rebound in the second quarter is a good forecast meanwhile it s premature to contemplate a rate cut here he added you do want to watch the data closely and you won t really know that until you get to the july time frame to him that would be the next time to revisit rate cut on yield curve inversion bullard said you would have to get a wider variety of spreads to be inverted the two year 10 year in particular also he noted it would have to stay inverted and be meaningfully inverted for awhile a matter of

associated press washington ap president donald trump s latest pick to help lead the federal reserve has received a rocky reception with top economists raising several red flags about whether stephen moore is qualified to be a governor of the world s most influential central bank moore is a former trump campaign adviser who helped design the 2017 tax cuts and the co authored trumponomics the economists say moore poses the distinct risk of injecting politics into an institution that strives to remain free of political influence when setting short term interest rates that can determine the path of employment inflation and overall growth he s merely a propagandist as far as i can tell said menzie chinn an economist at the university of wisconsin he makes just egregious mistakes in fact and theory even a prominent republican economist criticized the choice of moore after trump s announcement last week steve is a perfectly amiable guy but he does not have the intellectual gravitas for this important job harvard university economist greg mankiw said in a blog post mankiw a former chairman of the white house council of economic advisers for president george w bush added it is time for senators sic to do their job mr moore should not be confirmed still other prominent conservative voices are rallying to moore the wall street journal for which moore was once an editorial writer has endorsed him in a new editorial asserting that he might be a useful counter to the group think among fed officials the endorsement asserted that the remarkable cascade of derision and condescension from academic economists on moore s nomination is itself evidence that he should be a fed governor moore who has been affiliated with multiple conservative groups including the heritage foundation has taken a series of controversial stances about the fed despite acknowledging that he still needs to learn about how the regulator works he previously said that the fed should be scrapped in favor of the gold standard he called on the fed to hike rates during the great recession a move that could have further crippled the united states and he recently said that fed chairman jerome powell should be fired for rate hikes last year that in his opinion undermined the gains from trump s tax cuts the controversy took on a new dimension on wednesday when it was reported that he had a lien of more than 75 000 filed against him in january 2018 for unpaid taxes moore did not respond to an interview request for this report a u s official familiar with the matter said moore s background check a requirement of the nomination process was still underway his nomination has not been sent to the senate the official insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations but the president is likely to stick with moore after having been disappointed by his decision to make powell chairman said dan clifton a partner at the advisory firm strategas clifton noted that the fed has since backed off plans for rate hikes in 2019 suggesting that moore was correct in his criticism of powell in an opinion piece in the wall street journal regardless of public criticism trump supports steve and is willing to go to bat for him clifton said when has establishment criticism stopped trump before especially when it comes to someone trump personally respects moore fits a profile of trump nominees who have largely been radio and television pundits who defended the president only to then get elevated to roles as policymakers their new jobs involve nuances trade offs and tough analysis that seldom make for snappy soundbites larry kudlow for example segued from being a commentator on cnbc to director of the white house national economic council but decades of moore s public statements might now haunt him during the nomination process to be one of seven fed governors my concern with stephen is actually not so much what he knows but the fact that he claimed to know things that weren t so said george selgin director of the center for monetary and financial alternatives at the libertarian cato institute a washington think tank selgin noted that moore has suggested that the fed set rates based off changes in commodity prices mistakenly claiming that former fed chairman paul volcker was guided by this principle when fighting a wave of inflation during the early 1980s moore has at times been openly hostile to the idea of a central bank saying that the united states should return to a gold standard an idea openly dismissed by past fed leaders such as ben bernanke as inefficient and unworkable in the current global economy we have got to get rid of the federal reserve and move towards a gold standard in this country moore said at a 2015 event for the conservative group freedomworks that is available on youtube for his part moore claimed to be baffled by the criticism saying that in a radio interview for tim constantine s capitol hill show that any attacks come from a minority of economists who likely object to his loyalty to trump i can t explain why that is moore said i think some are just trump haters but the critiques from the economic community have often stemmed from his past policy statements not just his praise of the president s physique and tax cuts in 2008 moore argued for the fed to raise interest rates as the economy crumpled during the great recession saying on glenn beck s cnn show that the fed should get less dollars out in the economy the fed instead slashed rates to near zero and pumped money into the economy in order to boost spending investment and halt the worst downturn since the great depression the controversial and unprecedented move by the fed is now generally seen as helping to rescue the battered u s economy if the fed had followed moore s advice the economy would still be mired in recession and we may have dragged the global economy down with us said justin wolfers an economist at the university of michigan
