overview the spread of the coronavirus and the lockdown in the epicenter in china has again sapped the risk taking appetite in the capital markets asia is bearing the brunt of the adjustment tomorrow

january 8 a broad measure commodity price crb index is falling for the fourth consecutive week during which time it has fallen about 3 75 asia pacific within the disappointing japanese december trade report there were a few bright spots first negative signals need to be recognized to appreciate the positive signs exports and imports were weaker than expected exports fell 6 3 year over year nearly half again as big as the median forecast in the bloomberg survey 4 3 imports were off 4 9 compared with the median estimate for a 3 2 decline the auto sector remained problematic auto exports were off 11 8 and parts exports fell almost 11 given that exports fell nearly 15 to the us we suspect that it may show up in us auto import and inventory data it is the fifth consecutive month exports to the us fell the constructive news is that exports to china rose for the first time in 10 months albeit less than 1 moreover the export of semiconductor making equipment surged by a little more than a quarter the two are no unrelated japan s exports of chip fabrication equipment to china jumped 60 this is important too because semiconductor chips design and manufacturing are seen to be a bottleneck for china as part of its import substitution strategy it will likely ramp up its efforts to become more independent separately japan reported a 0 9 rise in its november all industries index it was near twice the gain expected and as another piece of data showing recovery after the october typhoon and sales tax boost australia s full time job growth is grinding down it fell 300 in december and rose an average of 5 3k a month in h2 19 this compares with 20 1k average in the first half of last year part time employment positions rose almost three times the median forecast bloomberg survey of 10k the unemployment rate unexpectedly slipped to 5 1 from 5 2 last seen in march 2019 officials indicated that the fires disrupted the data collection the reserve bank of australia meets on february 4 the pmis and q4 cpi in the coming days may impact expectations but the market has six basis points of a 25 bp move discounted the dollar is falling against the yen for the third session the upside momentum had stalled as the dollar poked above jpy110 the technical indicators warned that the rally from the geopolitical inspired loss near jpy107 65 had overextended the market today s setback brought the greenback to jpy109 50 where it has found new bids there are expiring options at jpy109 15 440 mln and jpy109 80 350 mln chart support is seen near jpy109 30 and the 20 day moving average is found near there the australian dollar has bounced back from yesterday s drop to almost 0 6825 to reach nearly 0 6880 today the aussie is flirting with the a 500 option stuck at 0 6865 that expires today there is a larger one for a 1 9 bln at 0 6915 that seems out of reach today europe norway s central bank as widely anticipated left policy on hold the ecb is center stage now lagarde s assessment that the economic and financial conditions in the eurozone have gotten less bad remains valid a formal update of the economic forecasts will be delivered at the next meeting march 12 the most important element of today s meeting will be the framing of the strategic review that lagarde will announce investors are most interested in how the price stability objective is defined the irony is that while market participants seem to be putting emphasis on the signaling of the ecb many are continuing to reject the importance of the fed s signaling the fed has consistently argued that its bill purchases and repos are not qe but the critics see the balance sheet expanding and dismiss the fed s signaling as disingenuous since the ecb s last review in 2003 the central bank has unveiled several new policy tools to achieve its objective an assessment of the efficacy of the new tools may also be included in the review for which lagarde says will leave no stone unturned which may hint at covering a broad range of stakeholders lastly the ecb s communication will also be re examined part of this seems to be in reaction to draghi s style which itself may have been a product of the crisis and efforts of the creditors to stymie efforts to protect the system recall the president of germany s bundesbank testified against the ecb before the european court of justice the economic and financial conditions have changed and lagarde offers a different management style from draghi and this has implications for how the diversity of opinion can be respected and incorporated as it is at other major central banks both us president trump and treasury secretary mnuchin reiterated america s threat to impose tariffs on european autos although the french seemed to agree not to collect the new digital tax until the end of the year ostensibly to see if a multilateral agreement can be struck in exchange for the us not imposing the up to 100 tariff on nearly 2 5 bln french goods however the us pushed back hard against the uk and italy imposing their own digital tax there are three reasons why this is an important issue for businesses and investors first it is a bit of a canary in a coal mine story having secured trade agreements with japan south korea china and modernized nafta europe was moving into the us trade cross hairs and the digital tax can be the initial spark second the hope of a quick us uk trade agreement that lighthizer optimistically suggested could be struck by the end of the summer seems misplaced the uk government reaffirmed its plans for a digital tax and the draft budget includes it third what is prompting the national solutions is at least in part the failure of the eu due to objections by sweden denmark finland and ireland and the oecd with the us arguing the agreement should not be binding economic nationalism undermines the multilateral efforts and moves into the space abdicated by its failure the euro is in about a 20 tick range below 1 1100 in uninspiring activity ahead of the ecb meeting there is an option for about 855 mln euros struck at 1 1110 that will be cut today the euro has been stuck in nearly a half cent range this week between 1 1070 and 1 1120 sterling has also been confined to narrow ranges today but is in the upper end of a two week range as the market tones down the dovish expectation for next week s boe meeting at the end of last week the market was pricing in about a 70 chance of cut next week now it is less than a 60 chance sterling looks comfortable in the 1 3020 1 3060 range and technical indicators suggest the extension is more likely to the upside than the downside america the bank of canada took another step to soften its neutral stance as investors adjusted to the new signal the canadian dollar weakened to its lowest level since boxing day it seems that the main deterrence to a rate hike is not inflation headline cpi stands at 2 and underlying measures are a little firmer but the risks associated with the household leverage until it becomes clearer if the slowdown that began in the middle of last year persists the trade off is not seen as desirable however that is likely to change by the middle of the year previously the market had seen only a one in four chance that the bank of canada would cut rates by the middle of the year after the meeting it became a little better than even money the canadian dollar may trade more sensitive to the domestic macro economic data in the period ahead that said soft q4 19 data is baked in the cake this makes the next bank of canada meeting in early march may be too soon for a cut poloz steps down in mid june and he would not be the first bank of canada governor to change policy at their last meeting e g thiessen and dodge the us reports weekly jobless claims and the leading economic indicator the lei has not risen since last july and fell three months through november which investors used to see as an indication that the economy was struggling these days it has little market impact the decision by the world health organization about the new virus apparently linked to snakes and bats and whether to declare a public emergency was postponed from yesterday to today the decision could have more impact than the us data canada reports november retail sales figures tomorrow and an uptick may help steady the canadian dollar as the us dollar approaches our initial target near cad1 3180 above there and the charts warn of potential into the cad1 3235 area where the 200 day moving average is found nearby support is seen near cad1 3130 the us dollar continues to move sideways in its trough against the mexican peso it has forged a base around mxn18 65 and has not managed to close above mxn18 80 since january 9 the sideways movement has neutered the trend following technical indicators but we suspect the next move is toward a stronger us dollar
euro is trading as one of the weakest major currencies together with canadian dollar for today there is little inspiration from ecb rate decision and press conference canadian dollar is weak on free fall in oil price with wti pressing 55 handle now australian dollar continues to be the strongest one for today as supported by better than expected employment data but upside is relatively limited yen is the second strongest on risk aversion global sentiments are pressured after china locks up two cities today to contain the outbreak of the new coronavirus technically eur usd is now pressing 1 1066 support decisive break there will add to the case of completion of corrective rebound from 1 0879 at 1 1239 deeper fall should then be seen to 1 0981 support for confirmation eur chf has already

guidance ecb left monetary policy unchanged as widely expected main refinancing rate is held at 0 00 marginal lending facility and deposit facility rates were held at 0 25 and 0 50 respectively the asset purchase program will continue at a monthly pace of eur 20b the forward guidance was also kept unchanged the governing council expects the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 within its projection horizon and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics ecb lagarde manufacturing remains a drag on ongoing but moderate growth in the post meeting press conference ecb president christine lagarde said incoming data since last meeting were in line with the baseline scenario of ongoing but moderate growth of the economy weakness in manufacturing sector remains a drag on momentum but employment and wages growth continue to support the resilience of the economy inflation remains subdued overall but there were signs of moderate increase in underlying inflation lagarde also repeated that risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook related to geopolitical factors rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets remain tilted to the downside but risks were less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade is receding headline inflation is likely to hover around current levels in the coming months inflation expectations have stabilized or ticked up slightly underlying inflation remained generally muted by there were indications of a moderate increase weaker growth momentum is delaying pass through of labor cost pressures to inflation france and us agreed to work on digital taxation at oecd french finance minister bruno le maire said france and the us has agreed today on the way to push digital taxation at the oecd level the bilateral dispute between the two countries on the issue is set aside the development reduces the risk of us retaliation on france s digital taxes we had long talks this morning with the us treasury secretary and the oecd secretary general and i am happy to announce to you that we have found an agreement between france and the united states providing the basis for work on digital taxation at the oecd le maire said it s good news because it reduces the risk of american sanctions and opens up the prospect of an international solution on digital taxation a series of proposals were hammered out for redrafting of international tax rules the proposals will be put to oecd next week for discussions between 137 governments uk leadsom wants both a trade deal with us and digital tax uk secretary of state for business energy and industrial strategy andrea leadsom said the government is still pushing for digital tax despite repeated objections by the us at the same time it s just one particular issues which will not stand in the way of a uk us trade agreement she told talk radio the united states and the united kingdom are committed to entering into a trade deal with each other and we have a very strong relationship that goes back centuries so some of the disagreements that we might have over particular issues don t in any way damage the excellent and strong and deep relationship between the u s and the uk there are always tough negotiations and tough talk but i think where the tech tax is concerned it s absolutely vital that these huge multinationals who are making incredible amounts of income and profit should be taxed and what we want to do is to work internationally with the rest of the world to cover with a proper regime that ensures that they re paying their fair share snb jordan negative interest rates and intervention still necessary snb chairman thomas jordan maintained today that negative interest rates are necessary for the swiss economy the board is aware of the side effects and that is the reason why we changed the threshold referring to raising the deposit limit before the charging 0 75 interest he added that gives us the freedom to maintain negative rates for longer and also to cut the rate if necessary jordan also reiterated that the franc is still highly valued and interventions are also necessary but he emphasized that we don t manipulate swiss franc exchange rate never intend to weaken the franc for any advantage yesterday snb governing board member andrea maechler said there is no change in the monetary policy after us treasury put switzerland back into currency manipulator watchlist she added we are doing monetary policy for switzerland markets pare rba cut expectation after strong job data australia employment grew 28 9k to 12 98m in december much better

to the upside surprises in job data anz said the data reinforce rba s view that the economy appears to have reached a gentle turning point it will be difficult to see rba easing in february even though rate cuts are more likely than not over the course of 2020 cba said rba would now likely cut by 25bps to 0 50 in april instead of february eur chf mid day outlook daily pivots s1 1 0719 p 1

the give and take of the global trade war between the us and china has created a wave of uncertainty regarding investment and growth in the region just as worrisome is britain s exit from the european union which is hitting the crucial tourism sector hard the imf world bank sees latin american and caribbean economic growth rising to 1 8 in 2020 from 0 2 in 2019 and could reach 2 7 by 2024 joining latinfinance for a roundtable discussion on oct 17 during the imf annual meetings six central bank governors described the threats to their economies participants were verónica artola of ecuador richard byles of jamaica rodrigo cubero of costa rica alejandro díaz de león of mexico cleviston haynes of barbados and héctor valdez of the dominican republic these are the highlights from the discussion edited and consolidated for space and clarity on the greatest threat to their economies díaz the reduction of oil prices and the reduction of oil volumes has significantly changed the external accounts in mexico for many decades you used to have oil trade surpluses in mexico now you have oil trade deficits and sizable trade deficits and you used to have non oil trade deficits and now we have non oil trade surpluses so this recomposition in the external accounts required a real exchange rate depreciation i think in our region we have had several countries experiencing real exchange rate depreciations in the case of mexico we have had uncertainty regarding nafta it has been a major obstacle for investment and an element that has weakened global demand we have come a long way in terms of having a negotiation and a package that is still pending legislative processes in the us and canada and we understand that it has a time of its own and we hope to see that work out the sooner the better also i think that the change of administration in mexico has also introduced some idiosyncratic elements of uncertainty those i think are the key elements that we have around the mexican economy that have driven gdp a little lower i think this is clearly close to what the world is experiencing as a consequence of the trade tensions in the case of mexico we have had clearly uncertainty regarding nafta it has been a major obstacle for investment and an element that has weakened global demand mexico central bank president alejandro díaz de león i think that probably in the case of mexico we saw some of these effects earlier but i think there is a commonality of trade tensions which introduces a lot of uncertainty we know that uncertainty weighs heavily on investments also trade and manufacturing has been affected in general by these trade tensions and to compensate for the adjustment which is lower global growth it also implies lower inflationary pressures and lower interest rates throughout the world and that has in a way benefited the region with a trend towards lower cost of finance and lower yield curves throughout the region valdez in the case of the dominican republic and this has happened throughout latin america there s been a complex external panorama of global uncertainty negative expectations fundamentally because of disagreements with the united states and china and also the disorganized brexit in the united kingdom for example in the case of the dominican republic the hotel sector that normally benefited from european clients visits from tourists spanish tourists french tourists english tourists that was very significant that has gone down significantly this has to do with the situation in europe and the situation in the european union artola these past years that president correa was in charge of the presidency in ecuador the main important sector in ecuador was the public sector now we are trying to make the private sector the main one in ecuador but we are facing some problems like mexico said international investors are not coming to ecuador because of the risk seen in ecuador with the imf or without the imf i am pretty sure that we must consolidate the fiscal sector we have a deficit around 6 of the gdp so we must reduce it we need around 8 billion each year to finance the fiscal sector that s a lot of money the debt that we have is not as good as we want we must change the reality of the external debt cubero what are the main threats to costa rican growth i d start with the external we have deceleration in the world economic growth rate but also and more importantly deceleration in global trade we know global trade right now is pretty much stagnant that is a factor that affects a very open economy like costa rica s but also we have the uncertainty that cloud of uncertainty lingering over our countries is really affecting investments and business plans in costa rica when you look at the history of our debt buildup a big portion of it has to do with fixing infrastructure after these natural disasters richard byles jamaica central bank governor and the elephant in the room is the fiscal situation we were near a fiscal crisis last year it was fortunately staved off as a result of the passage of a fiscal reform in december 2018 which was necessary to restore sustainability in the public finances we have a deficit that is reaching 6 of gdp our debt to gdp ratio is around 58 estimated for 2019 and the debt will continue to grow and the deficit will probably continue to grow despite the reform for the next two or three years but without the reform the sustainability of the public finances was not there the debt was on an explosive path and would have reached probably over 100 in a matter of 10 to 12 years so now the beauty of this fiscal reform is that it really tackles the roots of the fiscal crisis so next year the key threats for costa rica will be the external ones i think the domestic ones are becoming less important we re a little bit like keynes used to say pushing on a string the uncertainty is actually preventing better financial conditions from materializing into more consumption and investment and the take up of credit is not materializing precisely because of that uncertainty haynes so since last year from mid june with the new administration there has been a change in the overall policy framework we have reached out to the imf for support under an imf four year program a major aspect of this program has been a debt restructuring both domestic and foreign we completed the domestic component because a substantial portion of our debt was actually domestic rather than external we are in the process of bringing closure to the external debt restructuring like everyone else we are concerned about external developments as a tourism based economy what happens in the uk is of particular interest to us because a substantial share of our tourism comes from the uk market and the other substantial share actually comes from the us market so what happens in the global economy has the potential to impact our economy if not immediately several months down the road because some of these things tend to lag the other issue we face on a small island economy is our vulnerability to climatic shocks one of the difficulties of a small economy is that when you get these shocks it impacts the whole economy as distinct from some small segment as it may in mexico or the us with a small island economy these storms cover the whole island that really is the major concern that we have and something which we are focused on because all the work that we re doing to improve the fiscal and you get one of these shocks you re back to square one byles the challenges that we face to growth today in terms of trade with commodities have both a beneficial and a negative effect for us we still have large bauxite deposits so aluminum prices are very sensitive to those and those have gone down resulting in the closure of some of our bauxite and aluminum producing plants and that s been a very big negative for us on the other hand oil prices being where they are compared to where they were a couple of years ago is a big benefit to us and commodity prices generally wheat soy which we import quite a bit of those are pretty low and pretty stable and have been a benefit for us we have another six years to go before we can get to 60 debt to gdp so we have to stay very focused on that issue but because of that therein lies a big threat to our growth the act of being very tough on the fiscal side and paying down the debt is a drag on growth in the sense that the government doesn t have the ability to make the capital investments that we need to lay the foundation for growth like barbados i would say that a very big threat to us is natural disasters when you look at the history of our debt buildup a big portion of it has to do with fixing infrastructure after these natural disasters so we are exploring avenues of de risking in respect to natural disasters talking to the idb about it and creating a special fund internally to reduce contingencies on payment technology and the cashless society díaz in emerging markets i think we can get an additional huge benefit which is financial inclusion in the case of mexico we have a payment system an rtgs system real time gross settlement system that allows for immediate execution of payment and that is provided by the central bank we have more than 30 million mexicans that have a smartphone and they don t have a deposit account the fact that we can make the smartphone a payment device will push them towards opening a bank account and that will allow for a very significant financial inclusion i think central banks role in the payment system and developing networks is critical so this service is going to be zero cost zero charge to make it at as close as a substitute to cash as possible so neither the buyer nor the seller are going to pay any fees and this has a strong support from the banking sector community because they understand that they have more than 30 million mexicans to serve financially and this is the way to open the door for them but it has created tension obviously but i think there is a conviction that it s a very important step to promote financial inclusion cubero the issue of cryptocurrency is a little bit of a red herring but certainly there is a little bit of a threat of currency substitution coming from all these crypto assets whether crypto or not digital currencies and some central banks are thinking of issuing central bank digital currencies i think that is actually only a partial solution to a deeper problem the deeper problem is do you have a good reliable efficient low cost real time payment system at the digital level and if you provide that and if you manage to provide that highway then the legal tender should actually circulate through that highway without a threat from other currencies because to the extent that there is already a system that works everyone wants to use that system we need around 8 billion each year to finance the fiscal sector that s a lot of money the debt structure that we have is not as good as we want we must change the reality of the external debt veronica artola ecuador central bank manager artola a couple of years ago at the central bank we were managing the mobile payments but then private banks were telling us that was a reason for example to de dollarize the economy so there was really big propaganda against the central bank managing the mobile payments there was a decision to take the central bank out of mobile payments and only the private banks now are doing that i think that the mexico experience is really important for us because the central bank is the institution that must do that not the private banks private banks only want to charge they are not trying to get some financial inclusion they only want to get some money
on 26 january 2004 brazil s president luiz inacio lula da silva met india s prime minister atal bihari vajpayee in new delhi the brazilian leader was the chief guest at india s republic day parade the visit to india symbolised his wish to strengthen relations between the world s two biggest democracies among developing nations lula brought with him 100 businessmen and women from 78 different companies in an effort to expand bilateral trade as well as mercosur s eduardo duhalde paraguay s foreign minister brazilian ministers and the governors of parana and mato grosso i was part of the brazilian delegation to india representing the jai group a consultancy i had founded both brazil and india enjoyed considerable international momentum at the time their capacity to unite developing countries during the trade negotiations in cancun in 2003 marked a fundamental change in the overall dynamics of multilateralism in what was seen as a crucial step at the time india signed a preferential trade agreement pta with mercosur lula described the accord as the first step towards future free trade and as the inauguration of a new era in south south cooperation as he told brazilian journalists in rashtrapati bhavan immediately after his arrival in new delhi emerging nations cannot sit and wait for beneficial concessions from the richer nations accords such as these should not substitute international relations with developed countries but complement them today however hopes for free trade between brazil and india have faded and negotiations have not advanced much trade between brazil and india has grown albeit from a low base but it remains insignificant as a percentage of both countries overall trade the upcoming visit of president jair bolsonaro on 26 january 2020 once again as a chief guest for the republic day offers india to take a fresh look at brazil as a business opportunity a lot has changed the brazil of the last two decades since lula assumed power until his successor dilma rousseff was unceremoniously impeached in 2016 has undergone a major political change in the first decade of the 2000s under president lula brazil rode the commodity wave and easy access to capital to achieve significant economic progress the economic growth was largely achieved by direct transfer to the underprivileged and facilitating their greater participation as a labour force in the economy the discovery of large oil resources under the sea and brazil winning the olympic bid for 2016 capped the lula presidency however the ending of the commodity cycle and the impact of the global economic crisis happened at the time when brazil had reached full employment and had to take the next step towards structural reforms for productivity growth the good years had wrongly convinced the left of centre government now run by lula s successor that brazilian productivity growth could come without painfully reforming the inflated government budget or much needed tax reforms since the 1980s public expenditure as a share of gross domestic product gdp had trebled to 42 per cent a level similar to that of european welfare states mainly funded by an equivalently large and grotesque tax structure the quality of services is that of much poorer countries dilma instead tried to force interest rates down even while doubling down on fiscal profligacy the private sector refused to play ball by withholding investment and the result was stagflation which triggered a major political disruption resulting in the ouster of dilma and eventual return of centre right forces at the helm of brazil in 2019 in parallel a major corruption scandal involving the state oil giant petrobras resulted in half the business elite of brazil getting indicted the fact that president lula and his political team got muddled up in some of these scandals delegitimised some of the good things that happened under his watch paving the way for a political transition for the center right the political change has also been accompanied by economic reforms largely due to paulo guedes the finance minister of brazil who has enjoyed relative autonomy under the new president he has proposed to simplify the tax system radically while reducing rates and expanding the base to privatise nearly all state companies and after cutting red tape to enable businesses to withstand competition to open the economy to the world a pension reform has already been effected this will save the government 855bn reais 210bn over 10 years as the reform took shape in 2019 confidence grew leading to a recovery in investment the economy grew by 0 6 per cent between the second quarter and the third more than expected annual growth for 2020 is forecast to be at least 2 per cent mercosur a bloc dominated by brazil and argentina signed a long awaited accord with the european union in june but european reservations about brazil s environmental policies could prevent ratification as could the recent election of alberto fernandez a left wing protectionist as argentina s president argentina is an important member of the mercosur trade block brazil also has become closer to the us under bolsonaro a significant departure from president lula s time as pointers to its increasing alignment with us brazil has agreed to forgo a special status for developing countries at the world trade organisation dropped visa requirements for visitors from the us and granted permission for us companies to launch satellites from a brazilian base us military presence in brazil and defence co operation is expected to strengthen further as us refocuses on latin america even as it seeks to withdraw from many other regions a lot has not despite the many apparent changes the structural positives and negatives of brazil remains from an indian business standpoint let us look at the positives first we can classify them in to markets resources and technologies brazil as a market brazil remains the largest single country market in the western world after the us in terms of population with 216 million people and a per capita gdp of approximately 9 000 it has a gdp of 2 trillion and among the top 10 economies of the world ranked 9 in terms of specific products brazil tops the position in agro chemicals largest market in the world the fourth among cosmetics markets and sixth largest pharma market indian companies such as united phosphorous coromandel fertilizers torrent and aurbindo are beneficiaries of the size of these markets 34 per cent of 2019 consolidated revenues of upl came from brazil and insecticides is the single largest indian export category brazilian resources brazil has huge agricultural land with great potential and is one of the leading producers and largest exporters of soy sugarcane and corn india imports half a billion dollar worth vegetable oils mainly soy from brazil they are also major meat exporters brazil also has abundant gems and pearls and exports almost half a billion of gold and silver to india brazil unlike india is a significant oil producer and an oil exporter in fact indian imports from brazil is approximately 40 per cent crude oil brazil is south america s largest oil producer and the ninth largest global oil producer and the seventh largest oil consumer brazil owns the 15th largest world proven reserves of 12 67 billion barrels of oil and 372 billion cubic metres of gas brazilian technology one striking difference between brazil and india is the degree of urbanisation in brazil brazil has the same level of urbanisation as the uk or other european countries around 80 per cent at a per capita gdp of 20 per cent of the europeans brazil is further along the curve in many of the urbanisation initiatives be it banking penetration or urban transportation for instance two relative success stories of brazil in india have leveraged the development arbitrage curve tata marco polo buses that ply delhi roads and perto atms that icici bank deploys are a result of india based manufacturing done by brazilian companies in fact for the urban bus maker marcopolo india and its jv with tata represents its largest international revenue base from the not so positive side india s difficulties with brazil could be categorised as trade conflicts where both nations are competitive producers protectionism of a large economy where one of them is competitive and another relatively in efficient and third the universal barrier of bureaucracy and red tape and complex taxation fortunately cultural barriers do not hamper trade and investment while cultural differences certainly do exist trade competition brazil is an exporter and producer of many commodities that india is a large producer of in the early 2000s this author was hired by a large brazilian exporter of iron ore to china to evaluate the potential threat of india as a competing exporter india could compete because of proximity and a fragmented exporter base resulting in competitive prices that under cut giant exporters from brazil who depended on large carrier capacity cashew is another example where india brazil and vietnam have formed a loose alliance of cashew processors accounting for 90 per cent of world capacity mutual protectionism sugar is a classic example of the protectionism where india and brazil today have a wto case going on against india s sugar subsidies both are large domestic markets and producers that want to block access frozen chicken exports from brazil is a classic example even if they would not threaten much of the live chicken market india is very sensitive to any perceived threat to its chicken farmers brazil similarly places punitive targets brazil s huge tariff barriers protect its manufacturing which is its soft under belly service exports to brazil as many indian it service companies discovered to their dismay in last two decades is bad business with its taxation and labour mobility restrictions the domestic protectionism in brazil also is exacerbated by the low export revenue base of brazilian manufacturing and high levels of market share concentration in every single industry in brazil bureaucracy and red tape and taxation brazilian bureaucracy and red tape are well legendary corruption at high levels in brazil competed for this title as well petty corruption in brazil is completely absent unlike in india despite the best efforts of the prime minister the recent lava jato scandal which put many prominent brazilian businessmen behind bars has also made large scale procurement processes in brazil relatively corruption free as of now brazilian taxation is a complex system as this recent article from financial times articulates well why india needs to engage brazil great momentum existed for india to engage brazil when brics brazil russia india china and south asia was a buzzword capital was abundant one of the missed opportunities was to build scale by combining forces and building indo brazilian companies those days of easy global capital have dried up as both economies have struggled to find their feet in the last decade however indian exports have suffered from the global downturn and given india s import profile of essential commodities such as crude oil exports are an important component to balance the current account brazil is a large international market that is currently counter cyclical while many large markets around the world are getting more protectionist brazil is waking up to the merits of a more liberal regime while it remains to be seen how far the trade reform process will go before local industrialists will seek protection again the macro economic needs of brazil will ensure some opening up happens brazil also has a very low import to gdp ratio today less than half of that of india which points to both india s need for exports as well as brazilian ability to absorb more imports the current trade scenario is one where brazil has a surplus the increased engagement of us as a political ally and china as an investor with brazil is also expected to result in greater opening up one of the ways brazil sustained less than efficient trade regime was by subsidising its large manufacturing companies by concessional credit from its development bank while maintaining high tariffs this credit was funded by tax payer money and pension funds of government employees the brazilian bndes which is the equivalent of idbi icici ifci combined in their development bank days made more loans than the world bank in its heydays in the early 2000s is under a serious funding deficit thanks to slower growths and smaller pension outlays going forward this has accompanied a significant reduction in banking interest rates as some of the crowding out of credit by development funding has reduced and capital returns to market as a result both from the reduced supply of funds as well as reduced demand from industrialists who see a differential advantage to this concessional funding subsidy to local manufacturing is winding down the capital equipment sector is likely to see the impact of these changes two early examples of industries where such funding is slowing and consequently a greater opening up is visible is in infrastructure equipment and tractors these are still very small but distinct opportunities to build up indian exports tractors have been largely funded by bndes credit and tough localisation rules however indian tractor exports to brazil has jumped from a small base as sonalika and mahindra have set up local facilities and the differential of concessional credit has meant less and less prompting imports of cbu ckd imports from india even in small numbers given this is an area which is an input to the competitive agricultural export industry and india has already broken through in agrochemicals a combination of export promotion as well as select local investments could yield modest but promising results export of automobile vehicles is one area where india has had good results in the region whether bajaj and tvs motorcycles in colombia and central america three wheelers in peru and mexico and cars through intra firm trade in mexico the advent of electrical vehicles and the fact that adoption in latin america is slower also promise india can retain an edge as it develops its own electric vehicle industry latin america and brazil lack local original equipment manufacturers oems and the local auto component industry has suffered due to the crisis while india is going through its own crisis staying power of indian oems may prove to be a competitive advantage infrastructure is another promising area where brazil is expected to spend billions of dollars in energy as it builds out renewable wind and solar transmission lines and promotes oil and gas exploration stalled by the petrobras scandal especially in the area of electricity concessions brazil has made significant progress in creating a transparent auction system in which even indian sterlite has participated with some degree of success chinese state grid is a big investor and so are the spanish supplying these projects from india has been difficult in the past as a lot of these projects were funded with bndes money and many electrical equipment imports were under heavy tariffs a few things have happened since some of the major construction companies that executed the epc projects for these concessionaries have been hit by the scandal and new ones have taken their place aluminum smelters have closed down in brazil as the crisis hit the auto sector demand for value added aluminum parts so exports of conductors and unwrought aluminum from india has been ticking up brazilian manufacturing capacities are getting saturated as demand begins to surge for transmission equipment that could potentially lead to relaxation of imports these trends are likely to also be present in oil and gas equipment as multi national firms participate in auctions in the newly relaxed rules leading to greater global sourcing from india if indian exports is accompanied by select investments it will always help the investment of united phosphorus has been a useful ally to promote its exports in 2018 2019 imports of indian agrochemicals doubled to 600 million even as united phosphorus has visibly committed more investment technology services is another possible area to work with brazil except in fintech brazil has not advanced as much as india has in the new digital world also thanks to silicon valley s indian immigrants there exists opportunities to build completely new businesses with embedded digital technologies ola is contemplating and oyo has expanded in brazil even as softbank has famously declared latin america to be its investment destination in this decade and has started a new fund of 5 billion targeting the region brazil is among the advanced economies that can receive such an investment meaningfully what can india offer in return agriculture is one area india can offer meaningful concessions to brazil in return for opening up the industrial markets in brazil with the recent tiff with malaysian palm oil india can step up vegetable oil imports from brazil it can continue to import crude to offer relief to its beleaguered auto industry it can add ethanol hybrid as an option to its electric push to reduce dependence on crude brazil can be an able partner for setting up and supplying an ethanol fueling eco system given the vagaries of indian sugarcane crop importing some chicken from brazil can allow brazil to claim victory to allow further deepening engagement in the indian food processing story india and brazil are large markets that possibly missed an opportunity to deepen strategic collaboration when brics was a buzzword however the counter cyclical nature of brazilian liberalisation in a protectionist world offers india a potentially large export market india needs to strategically play its cards to ensure the opportunity is not wasted conceding a little strategically should be accompanied by getting meaningful reciprocity in industries simple things like standards make it difficult for india and brazil to trade reduced tariffs and greater willingness for brazil to allow indian entrepreneurs script success stories in its market even if unaccompanied by chinese level of capital investments will be a good ask
toronto jan 22 2020 globe newswire dream industrial reit dir un tsx dream industrial reit or the trust is pleased to announce its expansion into the european light industrial and logistics market this will allow the trust to pair high quality well located industrial properties that can generate higher yields and above average returns with an attractive cost of debt with rates that are over 200 bps lower on a comparative basis than north american financing to generate higher returns for its unitholders the fundamentals of the industrial and logistics markets across europe continue to remain attractive driven by the continued development and growth in e commerce fueling demand from logistics operators coupled with low supply of high quality and suitable product we believe the healthy rental growth potential paired with limited new supply under construction provides tailwind for strong performance in this sector over the next five to ten years dream unlimited corp dream has been active in europe since 1998 and is now dedicating its european platform and relationships to support the trust s european expansion subsequent to the sale of dream global reit to the blackstone group inc dream is committing its global asset management team who were responsible for dream global reit s success and its deep local relationships with tenants lenders brokers and partners to dream industrial reit dream s existing local european acquisition and asset management team along with long standing relationships with the european real estate brokerage network will support the trust in sourcing high quality and accretive transactions with long term cash flow and net asset value growth potential the trust is currently under contract or in exclusive negotiations to acquire 176 million 257 million of assets in strong industrial markets in the netherlands dutch portfolio and 48 million 70 million of assets in germany german portfolio through seven separate transactions the weighted average going in capitalization rate of the german and dutch portfolios is approximately 6 1 with a weighted average lease term of 5 3 years and in place rents below estimated market rents the trust intends to fund the acquisitions which are immediately accretive to its funds from operations with cash on hand subsequently the trust intends to hedge its entire euro capital exposure by borrowing 100 of the euro value of its portfolio to mitigate currency risk the debt will be a combination of unsecured and secured financings on properties in europe and north america denominated in euros as a result the total value of the portfolio will be hedged and we will access debt at 1 30 to 1 50 over a five year term from our debt and hedging strategy effectively we will continue to maintain a low leverage ratio with a higher proportion of the debt hedged in euros we expect the hedging and debt strategy on this transaction to generate approximately 0 02 to 0 03 per unit of accretion to our results on an annualized basis without increasing leverage concurrently we are focused on improving our overall cost of debt and improving the risk profile of our business by pursuing a more conservative leverage structure and optimizing our sources of debt capital by borrowing the amount of euro denominated debt to approximate the gross asset value of the european properties while concurrently reducing our debt in north america to maintain an overall leverage ratio well below 40 we will be able to achieve a much lower interest rate while mitigating currency risk on our investments we intend to continue to increase our unencumbered asset pool pursue an investment grade credit rating and obtain unsecured financings in 2020 dream s existing european platform people and its relationships with global lenders will help the trust successfully achieve this debt strategy we believe the strategies announced today will immediately position dream industrial reit to achieve meaningful accretion on ffo reduce risk improve average portfolio quality deliver above average long term value for unitholders and transform quickly into a premier global industrial real estate company with significant scale in canada the united states and europe for more information on the trust s european expansion and portfolio strategy please visit our website at www dreamindustrialreit ca background on december 10 2019 dream announced the closing of the sale of dream global reit to affiliates of real estate funds managed by the blackstone group inc a global leader in real estate investing in an all cash transaction valued at 6 2 billion the transaction was the culmination of the successful creation growth and sale of a high quality office and industrial portfolio since its ipo since its inception in 2011 dream global reit delivered total annualized returns of 15 to unitholders which exceeded both the canadian and european benchmarks by approximately 60 and is comparable to the top performing real estate private equity funds and pension funds globally over the same period upon closing of the transaction with blackstone on december 10 2019 the non compete clause for acquisition of commercial properties in europe is no longer applicable and dream will be able to dedicate its resources in supporting dream industrial reit s european expansion program with a population of over 500 million and increasing e commerce penetration the european market significantly increases the trust s investable universe the trust intends to continue expanding its portfolio in germany and the netherlands europe s most sought after and liquid logistics markets in addition the trust intends to evaluate investment opportunities in other core logistics markets in western europe offering compelling returns and ability to build scale we believe that modern logistics assets and urban light industrial properties are considered highly desirable by institutional investors as they offer superior risk adjusted returns compared to other asset classes however substantial scale is difficult to access and acquire without an established and reputable platform this scarcity and depth of the market will also likely create meaningful portfolio premiums for assembly of large high quality industrial portfolios over the medium term the trust intends to increase its exposure to europe to approximately 25 of its total portfolio value from 12 following the acquisition of the german and dutch portfolios announced today the trust remains committed to growing and improving the value of its portfolio across target markets in canada and the united states with experienced acquisition leasing and portfolio management teams dedicated to each region in addition to the acquisitions in europe the trust currently has nearly 170 million of properties that have recently closed are under contract or in exclusive negotiations in canada consisting of seven separate transactions primarily in the greater toronto area these assets are well located and are expected to deliver above average noi and nav growth over the next five to ten years we are confident in our canadian acquisition team s ability to source smaller but relatively more accretive transactions on an opportunistic and off market basis to build a meaningful canadian acquisition pipeline in 2020 predominantly in the gta and quebec in addition the trust will continue to leverage its local platform and strategic relationship with pauls corp to obtain unique access to acquisition and development pipelines in its target markets in the united states with a focus on sourcing properties that are high quality well leased multi functional and strategically located we target properties that can deliver steady and growing free cash flows to the trust over the long term and aim to acquire these properties at below replacement cost as previously mentioned dream will commit its platform and relationships to support the trust s growth and success in europe specifically mr alexander sannikov and mr bruce traversy have joined the trust in dedicated senior operating and investment roles mr sannikov joined dream in 2008 and was previously chief operating officer of dream global reit and had oversight of dream global s operating performance portfolio strategy and capital allocation previously he was senior vice president commercial properties of dream and was involved in underwriting and managing canadian commercial properties for dream including existing assets currently owned by dream industrial reit mr traversy joined dream in 1997 and was previously senior vice president head of investments of dream global reit and had oversight of dream global s investment strategy and its execution across europe mr traversy also has 20 years of experience acquiring industrial assets in canada including existing assets currently owned by dream industrial reit we are very excited to

industrial business improve operations across canada and work closely with our u s industrial platform to help us to continue to deliver long term value to our unitholders our debt strategy will allow dream industrial to significantly reduce its overall cost of debt over time with approximately 200 basis points of savings compared to the cost of debt in north america while providing an effective

unemployment levels netherlands is home to the port of rotterdam the largest container port in europe and amongst the 15 largest ports in the world as well as schiphol airport in amsterdam one of the busiest cargo airports globally the strong infrastructure for freight transport coupled with the development of the e commerce sector continues to boost demand for well located warehouse and logistics space in the netherlands resulting from these attractive fundamentals the dutch industrial and logistics markets have been one of the top performing markets in europe declining vacancy rates and a low to moderate level of incoming supply have continued to put upward pressure on rental rates the dutch portfolio comprises 34 high quality light industrial and logistics properties primarily concentrated in the country s major urban centres including amsterdam and rotterdam with over 80 of the properties located within 30 km of their respective city centres the portfolio spans 2 4 million square feet and is 96 leased to over 70 tenants providing a safe and diversified tenant mix the tenant base consists of an attractive mix of large and medium sized enterprises that span across multiple industries with significant capital invested by several tenants at their respective properties the portfolio s concentration near major urban centres enables it to serve as key last mile distribution sites and capture growing demand from e commerce focused users for industrial space in these markets the purchase price of 257 million represents an attractive going in yield of 6 2 with the opportunity to further grow cash flow through the lease up of vacant space and capturing rental rate growth on lease roll over the average in place rental rate is 5 below current market rent and

average occupancy of 92 and combined 738 000 square feet the properties are highly functional well located in strong urban logistics locations with excellent transport access and leased to 18 tenants

instruments electronic chattel paper digitized assets digital assets can themselves be assets or instead can reflect the ownership of an underlying asset for example electronic records that are the equivalents of negotiable instruments and electronic chattel paper would be digital assets as would an electronic recording of a security interest in the underlying asset such as recording title to real or personal property and the use of tokens to represent revenue streams from otherwise illiquid assets such as patents and commercial real estate sometimes referred to as a tokenized or digitized asset in addition to reporting on the law and regulation governing blockchain smart contracts and digital assets this bulletin will also report on the legal developments to support the infrastructure

beirut the main threat facing the syrian government of president bashar al assad as he regains control over most of his war torn country is not military but economic and the popular discontent over syria s rapidly worsening economic troubles is palpable so far this year the currency has plunged to half its value in 2019 the prices of some consumer goods have doubled and those of staples such as meat and vegetables are up as much as 50 percent according to official estimates the government plans to ration sugar rice and tea via a smart card system introduced last year to ration oil products at subsidized prices the steep drop in the syrian currency is largely the result of an economic crisis next door in lebanon said samir aita a syrian economist based in paris the lebanese pound s value has fluctuated in the past few months it lost two thirds of its value against the dollar last week before recovering slightly advertisement lebanon was syria s only lung aita said lebanon is a hub for syrian traders and business executives a place where they can open bank accounts access dollars and buy up small goods to take back to syria which is under heavy sanctions austerity in lebanon will be a disaster for living conditions in syria aita said we are going toward famine as a result of lebanon s crisis syria s troubles are compounded by u s sanctions on iran which had provided syria a lifeline with oil shipments even more significantly syria is under sanctions from the united states and its allies aimed at pressuring the assad government out of power so far syrians say that embargo has done little but rob them of a normal life the crisis has provoked small signs of dissent a rarity in the police state even the al watan newspaper effectively a government mouthpiece weighed in reporting the fall of the currency with the headline amid governmental silence the black market dollar surpasses 1 000 pounds on a cold day last week in the syrian city of sweida dozens of people gathered outside a municipal building and chanted we want to live we want to live advertisement although protests are common in rebel held areas of syria sweida is under government control no police arrested protesters no bullets were fired no one told the demonstrators to stop according to videos and an activist who participated no one deemed them terrorists or paid agents as usually happens with protesters instead the syrian state news agency sana reported the event in one line a few people gathered in the president s square known as traffic square in central sweida city and started chanting objecting to the reality of living conditions the protests which have refrained from calling for the government s ouster continued for days according to the activist who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution people are expressing their discontent the activist said in a telephone interview the building economic pressures have driven people into the streets uniting those who oppose the government and those who support it albeit in small numbers she said advertisement the economic situation in sweida is dependent on expatriates she said as in other places in government held areas many of the town s onetime inhabitants now reside in lebanon they send back money and bring back small goods but many young men have started returning home from lebanon because of the economic crisis there the activist said share this article share about 83 percent of syrians live under the poverty line the united nations estimated last march the black market rate for the syrian pound which stood at 47 pounds to the dollar just before the start of the civil war in 2011 has hit a record low in 2020 surpassing 1 000 pounds to the dollar the price of meat vegetables fruit and canned goods increased 30 to 50 percent in the last quarter of 2019 according to a report by a governmental economic committee in damascus province the cost of medical treatment is also up advertisement the government in the meantime has warned against hoarding dollars at home and an official decree outlawed using dollars as currency the state has launched a campaign urging people to buy local products to revive the economy and government salaries have been raised 10 percent in a meager attempt to keep up with inflation economists business executives and traders who support the syrian regime are calling on their government to step in to prevent the situation from deteriorating further abdul nasser al sheikh fattouh vice president of the federation of syrian chambers of commerce spoke of an economic resistance approach the exchange rate will not improve and the lira will continue to devaluate in the future he told the washington post in a written statement unless the government stimulates production by supporting small and medium size businesses and relieves their debts and grants them loans with subsidized interest rates the syrian pound is also referred to as the lira the exchange rate keeps jumping up and down with little to no intervention from the government as if the country is not going through an economic crisis ammar youssef a damascus based economist said in a phone interview the central bank must intervene and announce an economic emergency status he said hassan jawad head of the regional office of the arab exporters and importers union said in a phone interview that the government lacks a clear economic policy syria succeeded militarily so the countries that conspired against it had to resort to an economic siege through which they can pressure the people to rise against their government jawad said advertisement in washington congress recently approved a package of severe sanctions dubbed the caesar act that targets officials military personnel and anyone responsible for war crimes committed during the syrian civil war these additional sanctions effectively paralyze trade with syria and prevent any entity

photo depositphotos com andrewlozovyi so instead of predicting the most probable scenario which is fairly obvious it is more useful to consider unlikely events that would alter the likely benign scenario i believe ten risks could cause the most economic and financial trouble in 2020 these are not predictions continuing global expansion is more probable than any combination of these setbacks and they are not surprises which by definition are impossible to foresee rather they are known unknowns arranged from the lowest risk to the highest in my view the smallest risk is the one that many economists predict every year a global recession caused by the united states or china a recession is inevitable but less likely in 2020 than in any of the previous ten years while investment and manufacturing worldwide have suffered from the us china trade war macroeconomic policies in both countries have boosted housing services and public spending the world economy will continue to benefit this year from a tailwind from last year s us interest rate cuts and china s efforts to support roughly 6 growth absent some powerful new shock recession in 2020 is therefore extremely unlikely likewise there is a negligible risk of higher interest rates many investors and businesses are worried that today s low interest rate environment may soon end at least in the us inflation and long term interest rates will probably rise somewhat this year but it is almost out of the question that central banks will tighten monetary policy the fed would lead this process and it will not raise rates in an election year in europe instead of triggering an epidemic of euroskepticism brexit has acted like a vaccination even the populist leaders in italy france and germany seem deterred by the brexit experience and this year s negotiations on a post brexit trade deal will reinforce europeans negative perceptions of the process but politics is always volatile especially in italy so a politically driven euro crisis remains a low but non negligible risk although the us china trade war grabbed the most attention in 2019 europe was actually the weakest link in the world economy recently europe s economic performance has stabilized and policy has improved dramatically with the european central bank restarting quantitative easing and political sentiment turning against fiscal austerity but germany s economy still faces an existential crisis and european politicians have an almost unbroken record of foolish efforts to cut budget deficits when their economies need fiscal support a european recession therefore remains the biggest macroeconomic risk in 2020 just as it was last year then there is the threat of a major energy disruption since the us assassination of iranian quds force commander qassem suleimani financial markets have been worrying about a spiral toward war and a spike in oil prices every global recession in the past 50 years been preceded by a doubling of the oil price although not every doubling of the oil price has been followed by a recession to double year on year oil prices would have to soar above 110 this is unlikely but possible if a us iran war stopped shipping in the persian gulf an oil induced recession is therefore a moderate risk there is also a moderate risk of increased protectionism the us china trade war has been a market obsession long enough for the bad news to be largely priced in and the phase one agreement suggests no further escalation this year that still leaves several trade risks on the horizon especially for europe which is vulnerable to a breakdown in the brexit talks or to a diversion of trump s protectionist instincts from chinese electronics to german cars but trump will probably be too busy this year with the iran confrontation and the election in november to start a us eu trade war meanwhile uk eu trading relations will remain completely unchanged until december 31 as a result greater global protectionism is a smaller risk this year than it was in 2018 and 2019 there are two other moderate risks to growth this year one is that debt ratios in us corporations have risen to unprecedented levels far exceeding the levels that preceded the financial crisis but this is hardly surprising given that interest rates have never been so low for so long while a leverage bubble will probably be a risk sometime in the future there is no reason why it should burst or even deflate until interest rates significantly rise this is why corporate leverage seems only a modest threat in 2020 the last moderate risk is of an auto industry collapse sales collapsed worldwide last year devastating the german economy which is by far the biggest exporter of cars and machinery for making them production in germany is now below its trough in the 2009 recession and the industry s decline is not just a cyclical problem a perfect storm of environmental concerns social changes and energy and technological transitions means that the auto and engineering industries not only in germany but also in the us japan and western europe are probably in a secular decline that could prove as profound as the deindustrialization of the 1980s but the collapse in demand last year was so extreme that a temporary recovery is likely which is why the auto and engineering industries should not cause as much trouble this year the risk to the technology sector by contrast is political and high big tech firms can no longer rely on policymakers deference once regarded as innovators and agents of progress facebook apple amazon and google are now viewed as ruthless monopolists that manipulate politicians and exploit consumers these companies have been the main driving force of the us economy and stock market and serious political challenges to their business models in the form of regulation special taxation or breakup could cause a repeat of the 2000 02 dot com bust a reckoning could begin this year the highest of the ten risks stems from the us presidential election global markets consensus that president donald trump will win exposes them to two potential shocks a victorious trump could become even more protectionist belligerent and unpredictable in a second term and if his opponent is bernie sanders or elizabeth warren the us economy s four biggest sectors health care finance technology and energy will face unprecedented threats of disruption given that trump is bound to make statements that alarm investors and that some opinion polls will suggest a possible democratic victory at some point in the campaign us politics is almost certain to trigger occasional bouts of panic before november 3 project syndicate 1995 2020

trade friction with the united states has slowed china s growth while the economy appears to have bottomed out though the support of stimulus measures it remains burdened with a major problem noted by many in recent years the excess liabilities of companies and banks nonperforming loans a financial crisis in china could deal an enormous blow to the world economy echoes of japan s asset bubble china s exports to the united states have slowed due to mounting trade fiction and growing uncertainties have caused private fixed asset investments to falter china s economy however appears to be bottoming out thanks to stimulus measures by the chinese government such measures as the lowering of the policy interest rate the reduction of corporate taxes by 2 trillion yuan about 31 trillion the easing of the social security burden the promotion of infrastructure investments through the increase of local government bond issuance subsidies for high tech manufacturing industries and the early commercialization of 5g the next generation communication standard appear to have been successful moreover there are glimmers of a global recovery of it demand and a number of national governments have announced stimulus measures as a result of these developments china s economy is showing signs of bottoming out as seen in the rebound of new orders for the manufacturing industry but we must not overlook the structural problems that continue to bedevil china s economy while income disparities and environmental pollution are serious issues i pay the most attention to the problem of excess liabilities and bad loans in the last decade liabilities have surged in china primarily in the corporate sector according to the bank for international settlements corporate liabilities in china grew fourfold from 31 trillion yuan at 2008 year end about 480 trillion to 136 trillion yuan about 2 1 quadrillion at 2018 year end the ratio of corporate liabilities to gdp has surged from 98 to 152 during the same period as the figure shows this rapid growth of liabilities is reminiscent of japan s asset bubble years one third of this 136 trillion yuan consists of loans to special purpose companies called local government finance vehicles that local authorities use to finance infrastructure investments and real estate development since the average bank lending rate is currently an annualized 5 7 in china the annual interest burden of companies is estimated to be 7 752 billion yuan 121 trillion or 8 6 of gdp zombie companies with excess production capacity are growing in number continuing to survive without being forced out of the market it is worrisome to contemplate how long they can keep borrowing to meet debt payments vastly understated official figures given such circumstances the risk of a financial crisis in china cannot be ruled out the flip side to the rapid growth of corporate liabilities is the rapid expansion of credit the ratio of bank lending to gdp has jumped 30 in five years a report of the international monetary fund indicates that the ratio of total credit to gdp has climbed 30 or more in 42 countries over a five year period of those countries 18 experienced a hard landing and a financial crisis within five years time in other words more than 40 of countries seeing a credit expansion like china suffered a financial crisis to ascertain the risk to china s financial system it will be useful to understand the bad loan situation in the official statistics of the chinese government the bad loan ratio of all commercial banks rose from 1 0 at 2011 year end to 1 9 at the end of september 2019 the chinese government explains that while there is a certain amount of risk banks have the capacity to absorb losses banks however do not always disclose their management situation precisely and the actual bad loan ratio is thought to be far higher using 2015 financial data for some 2 300 listed companies i have estimated that the potential bad loan ratio is five times the official figure this would mean that the potential ratio is currently close to 10 while statistical differences preclude a straightforward comparison china s potential bad loan ratio exceeds the peak ratio of 8 4 recorded by japan s major banks during the fiscal year ending march 2002 for this reason we should consider the possibility that over the next few years the failure of small and medium sized banks will generate mistrust among banking institutions triggering a china crisis one of the reasons for the accumulation of corporate liabilities and bad loans is thought to be the 4 trillion yuan stimulus package and aggressive monetary easing that china instituted in response to the global financial crisis of 2008 another significant reason is the number of companies and banks making risky business decisions premised by tacit government guarantees or explicit loan guarantees since the government protects state owned companies and banks from bankruptcy such companies came to assume liabilities exceeding their capacity to repay state owned banks also became lax in monitoring their own management and the management of companies receiving their loans much of the funds raised by state owned companies has been invested in inefficient or marginally profitable infrastructure projects and real estate development such manufacturing industries as steel cement and solar panels have become burdened with overcapacities companies resorting to financial engineering have left them with distorted balance sheets investing in risky financial assets over tangible investments is known as abandoning reality for the virtual 脱実向虚 tuo shi xiang xu in china while speculative investments do occur in the real estate and stock markets what has become most popular are bank wealth management products and other shadow banking products that are unregulated by the government and that offer high yields can a financial crisis be avoided should the problem of excess liabilities and bad loans trigger a financial crisis in china its effects will propagate instantly like a powerful tremor through the world economy in 1997 and 1998 a bad loan problem led to a financial crisis in japan financial difficulties spread in a chain reaction between financial institutions and it became impossible for the government to protect financial institutions through a convoy system where good banks look after those in trouble it also became unrealistic for financial institutions to continue to protect closely affiliated companies through a main bank system as a result an economic growth rate that had rebounded to 5 1 in 1996 slumped to 1 6 in 1997 and became a negative 2 5 in 1998 should china repeat japan s mistake the first to react will be the stock and foreign exchange markets japanese stocks will plunge and the yen will appreciate japan s real economy will also be significantly affected japanese automobiles household electronics and industrial machinery will be priced out of the chinese market and chinese visitors to japan will decline sharply from large to small enterprises and from manufacturing to service industries japanese companies will be adversely impacted the chinese government has been dealing proactively with precursors to a financial crisis in may 2019 the people s bank of china took over baoshang bank the first failure of a commercial bank in 21 years this act prevented mistrust from worsening between banks however as indicated in the imf s article iv staff country report published in november 2019 there are many other banks similar to baoshang bank that risk going under recently the banker s acceptances of many smaller institutions are being refused and a few runs on banks have been seen will china be able to continue its economic growth without encountering a financial crisis given the small size of its per capita gdp compared to advanced economies china has plenty of room to grow should such growth expand the size of its economy this will ease sentiment that bad loans and corporate liabilities are excessive also china s divergent political system may enable it to rapidly deploy public funds to prevent a worsening of the situation the fact that financial intermediation mainly takes place through state owned banks is an advantage china has over other countries disposal of bad loans under the xi administration the research of carmen reinhart and kenneth rogoff of howard university however casts doubt on such optimism in this time is different reinhart and rogoff note that 268 crises occurred in 66 countries between 1800 and 2000 and that financial crises affected countries at all stages of development china has many forms of financial institutions such as commercial banks the postal savings bank of china rural cooperative banks and rural credit cooperatives that number about 4 000 in total there are questions about how well the chinese government understands the bad loan situation at these banks and whether it will be able to allocate sufficient public funds in a crunch there is no effective and easy prescription for reducing excess liabilities and bad loans while the chinese government is seeking to strengthen the risk management of companies local governments and financial institutions such efforts merely treat the symptoms they will not solve the problem in any fundamental way what is required is to gradually eliminate tacit government guarantees and explicit loan guarantees toward banks and companies little progress has been made however since any misstep in doing so will risk the successive failure of state owned companies local governments and financial institutions since xi jinping became president of the people s republic of china in 2013 government administration has become more controlling president xi intends to maintain an economic structure of codependence through the strengthening and expansion of the state owned sector the problem of excess liabilities and bad loans is likely to persist over the long term as a downside risk for the chinese economy originally written in japanese banner photo

frankfurt am main european central bank president christine lagarde was slightly more upbeat thursday about risks to the eurozone economy and insisted climate change would be central to a rethink of the institution s goals and methods risks to the euro area remain tilted to the downside but have become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade is receding lagarde told reporters in frankfurt while an orderly brexit and a us china trade truce have cleared some of the air around trade president donald trump raised fears of a fresh row this week when he revived a threat to slap tariffs on european car imports but with european commission president ursula von der leyen set for us eu trade talks in washington next month the tone and the determination on both sides to draw positive conclusions i think is to be taken as a positive signal lagarde said as expected governors left interest rates at historic lows and maintained quantitative easing qe bond buying purchases at thursday s meeting the second chaired by lagarde since taking the helm in november they also officially kicked off a major strategic review expected to last all year we will not leave any stone unturned lagarde reiterated with the primary focus of the rethink how the bank defines its mandate of maintaining price stability and how best to pursue it the institution s last stock taking in 2003 took place several years before the global financial and economic crisis forced it into unprecedented stimulus action pressed repeatedly by reporters on how she sees different aspects of policy developing lagarde said it would be unfair to preempt the outcome the toughest challenge will be how the ecb communicates about the review and the question of how to give a constructive outlet to differing opinions once it s over economist marcel fratzscher of german think tank diw said much of lagarde s first weeks and months in office were spent smoothing over differences after an acrimonious battle over policy loosening broke out under predecessor mario draghi in a statement about the ecb s planned review the debate around the bank s inflation target took pride of place for most of its active life the ecb has aimed for inflation close to but below two percent to fulfil its mandate to keep eurozone prices stable over the past seven years it has failed to achieve that level despite unprecedented policy experiments including years of negative interest rates and over 2 6 trillion euros of qe one option would be to simply target inflation around two percent the ecb s monetary policy toolkit and communications were equally prominent in the statement but lagarde s much hyped push to bring climate considerations into policymaking received only a supporting role alongside financial stability and employment concerns i m aware of objections that climate action could distract from the ecb s primary objective lagarde said but she warned of the danger of doing nothing failing to try is already failing she insisted adding that commitment to climate action is now the determination of the european commission of many of the euro area leaders and which is also now creeping into the private sector with some signs pointing to decreasing risks and a rebound from 2019 s growth slowdown this year policymakers will be hoping the ecb will be left in peace to determine its new direction without too many distractions a substantial change of the ecb s monetary policy before the end of the strategy review looks unlikely said ing bank analyst carsten brzeski binge worthy and nail biting ecb meetings will otherwise not return before the end of the review he added the international monetary fund lagarde s old patch this week pointed to a moderate pick up in global growth ahead although policy missteps could still derail it nevertheless some economists predict the ecb will lower rates further this year if no pickup in growth and inflation is forthcoming meanwhile qe is expected to continue at 20 billion euros 22 billion worth per month well into 2020 afp

with a summary of results on slide 3 this morning we reported full year 2019 net income of 674 million or 4 61 per share down by 4 compared to full year 2018 net income of 704 million or 4 81 per share now excluding non operating income i m sorry excluding non operating items we reported full year 2019 adjusted net income of 708 million or 4 84 per share an increase of 4 compared to full year 2018 adjusted net income of 682 million or 4 66 per share fourth quarter 2019 net income was 188 million or 1 29 per share up by 10 compared to the third quarter net income of 171 million or 1 17 per share and also up by 9 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 net income of 173 million or 1 18 per share fourth quarter 2019 adjusted net income was 187 million or 1 28 per share up by 9 quarter over quarter and up by 8 year over year in 2019 east west achieved record full year revenue of 1 7 billion which grew by 5 year over year and record net interest income of 1 5 billion which grew by 6 year over year we ended the year with record loans of 34 8 billion an increase of 7 from last year and record deposits of 37 3 billion an increase of 5 from 2018 2019 also end a transformational decade for east west during which we moved we more than doubled our asset size to 44 2 billion and grew both our commercial loans and our non interest bearing deposits nearly fivefold over the past 10 years we achieved substantial growth and diversification in loans deposits and revenue strengthening the resilience of our balance sheet earnings and profitability our diluted earnings per share also grew by 458 in the decade our growth and profitability reflect the strength of our diverse business model which is the foundation for continued solid financial performance for years to come in 2019 we earned a return on assets of 1 59 return on equity of 14 2 and the return on tangible equity of 15 9 this is the fifth consecutive year of a return on tangible equity above 15 on slide 4 you can see the five quarter trend and our ratios our profitability was once again strong in the fourth quarter fourth quarter 2019 return on asset was 1 68 return on equity was 15 and the return on tangible equity was 16 7 moving to slide 5 our loan portfolio is well balanced between commercial commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans over the past 10 years we steadily made investments in people and our infrastructure building specialized commercial lending verticals expanding our cross border capabilities and broadening our lending solutions this has resulted in a diversified platform capable of generating above industry organic loan growth year in year out as of december 31 2019 total loans reached a record 34 8 billion an increase of 2 4 billion or 7 as i mentioned earlier full year 2019 average loans of 33 4 billion grew 3 1 billion or 10 over last year by portfolio residential mortgage grew 15 year over year commercial real estate and c i both grew by 9 in dollar terms loan growth was evenly distributed across the three sectors which all grew just over 1 billion each for the fourth quarter of 2019 average loans of 34 4 billion grew by 9 linked quarter annualized we saw very strong growth from commercial real estate which increased by 505 million or 15 linked quarter annualized followed by residential mortgage which increased by 247 million or 12 linked quarter annualized in fact the fourth quarter of 2019 was the best quarter in the history of east west in terms of single family residential mortgage originations average commercial loans grew by 34 million or 1 quarter annualized and with that i will move on to review our 2020 outlook apologize for that let me go back to my script in order the average loan growth of 10 in 2019 was achieved in a challenging environment including three interest rate cut by the federal reserve of slowing economy and an ongoing us china trade tension that started to escalate in 2018 and remained high throughout the past year at east west the headwinds from the us china trade tension are most easily visible in our wholesale trade portfolio which typically shows seasonally strong growth in the fourth quarter instead last year we saw a decrease in commitment of 7 and a decrease in loan outstanding of 12 year over year as of december 2019 we had commitments of 2 35 billions and loans outstanding of 1 4 billion in our wholesale trade portfolio however what is less visible is the focus and active management of our commercial loan portfolio throughout 2018 and 2019 over the course of the past two years where we could we actively reduced credit exposures particularly to customers with higher direct or indirect tariff related credit risks largely concentrated in the wholesale trade and manufacturing importantly we have experienced only one charge off related trade tariffs and it was less than 1 million east west is starting the new decade with confidence knowing that our portfolio is better position and stronger today and we are ready to support our customers as geopolitical backdrop improves with the signing of the partial trade agreement on january 15 we believe that there is more clarity surrounding the us china trade dispute in addition our customers have adapted to the new normal of us china relations in terms of the operations and cost over the past two years reduced tariffs uncertainty and geopolitical volatility should only allow them to resume growth this clarity should have a positive impact for east west in particular for our ability to grow our cross border loans and expand our cross border customer relationships the value of the expertise that our cross border bankers bring to the table has only increased we ve seen renewed interest from chinese firms exploring direct foreign investments or evaluating expansion opportunities in the united states in the manufacturing energy or service sectors furthermore the expected increase in purchase of us manufactured goods by china provides cross border trade expansion opportunity for our customers also now more than ever the need for us based business to develop a china strategy and understand the chinese market dynamics is vital east west is well positioned to take advantage of the evolving nature of the us china cross border business and we are confident about our ability to expand both our commercial and consumer market share in this sector in 2020 and future years for the full year 2020 our current outlook for the end of period loans is growth of 7 to 8 we expect that the growth in 2020 will come from across all of our major loan portfolios of commercial real estate residential mortgage and c i now moving on to slide 6 for a discussion of deposits as of december 31 2019 our end of period loan to deposit ratio was 93 2 as we have previously stated we are comfortable operating with a loan to deposit ratio in the range of 90 to 95 total deposit grew to a record 37 3 billion as of december 31 2019 an increase of 1 9 billion or 5 year over year full year 2019 average deposit of 36 billion grew 2 8 billion or 8 from 2019 average deposit growth for the 2019 full year primarily came from growth and deposits and interest bearing checking partially offset by a decrease in non interest bearing demand accounts that happened in the first quarter of last year in fact after declining in the first quarter due to a shift to interest bearing checking for certain customer balances our non interest bearing demand deposits steadily grew quarter over quarter in the second third and fourth quarters for the fourth quarter of 2019 average deposit of 37 4 billion grew by 10 linked quarter annualized at which deposit growth in the fourth quarter was led by growth in interest bearing checking which is seasonally strong in fourth quarter for some of our commercial customers followed growth in non interest bearing demand and money market accounts partially offset by a decrease in average time deposits as we actively reduce higher cost deposits the fourth quarter 2019 average cost of deposit decreased by 11 basis points linked quarter to 0 94 and an average cost of interest bearing deposit decreased by 15 basis point to 1 34 accelerating the pace of decrease from the third quarter as of december 31 2019 the end of period cost of deposits was 0 9 down by 11 basis point from 1 01 at the end of the third quarter the end of period cost of our interest bearing deposit was 1 28 as of december 31 down by 15 basis point from 1 43 as of september 30 i m pleased to note that since the fed began cutting the fed funds rate in july we achieved a reduction in the cost of deposits across all of our major deposit types while at the same time also growing non interest bearing demand balances i would now turn the call over to irene for a more detailed discussion of our fourth quarter 2019 financial results and our outlook for 2020 irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer thank you dominic on page 7 we have a slide that shows the summary income statement and a snapshot of tax related and notable items during the quarter for the fourth quarter 2019 we reported diluted eps of 1 29 and adjusted eps of 1 28 our tax expense in the fourth quarter was 31 million and our effective tax rate was 14 this compares to a tax expense of 35 million and effective tax rate of 17 in the third quarter the decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate relative to the third quarter resulted from additional tax credit investments and a true up of previous year s tax reserves our tax expense for the full year of 2019 was 170 million and the effective tax rate was 20 included in the full year 2019 income tax expense was 30 million reversal of certain previously claimed tax credits adjusted full year 2019 tax expense was 140 million and the effective tax rate was 17 compared to a tax expense of 115 million on an effective tax rate of 14 for the full year 2018 in our outlook for 2020 we project that our effective tax rate will be 15 moving on to the discussion of net interest income on page 8 fourth quarter net interest income of 368 million decreased by 1 6 million or 0 4 linked quarter the fourth quarter gaap net interest margin was 3 47 a contraction of 12 basis points from the prior quarter the quarter over quarter change in our gaap net interest margin is as follows 15 basis point decrease from lower loan yields 4 basis point decrease from lower yields on other interest on other interest earning assets including investment securities 4 basis point decrease from the asset mix shift and net increase in investment securities all of which were partially offset by 11 basis point increase to the net interest margin from a lower cost of funds asc 310 30 discount accretion was 6 million in the fourth quarter higher quarter over quarter due to recoveries and added 6 basis points to the net interest margin the fourth quarter adjusted net interest margin excluding the impact of discount accretion was 3 41 in the third quarter discount accretion income was 2 5 million which added 3 basis points to the net interest margin as of december 31 2019 the accretable portion of the asc 310 30 discount accretion was 10 million and the impact of accretion on our net interest income and our net interest margin in 2020 and beyond is expected to be immaterial as such we will no longer separately report the asc 310 30 discount accretion in our 2020 outlook we expect that the gaap net interest margin will range between 3 40 to 3 45 this translates to a stable margin relative to our fourth quarter adjusted net interest margin of 3 41 in our interest rate outlook we assume that the fed funds rate will be unchanged in 2020 a tailwind to our margin supporting our nim outlook for 2020 is the near term repricing benefit of our maturing time deposits in the first quarter of 2020 we have 3 9 billion of time deposits maturing at a weighted average rate of 1 79 and in the second quarter of 2020 we have another 2 3 billion maturing at a weighted average rate of 1 85 for comparison in the fourth quarter of 2019 we originated or renewed 3 5 billion of time deposits at a weighted average interest rate of 1 28 down from a weighted average interest rate of 1 54 in the third quarter of 2019 for new and renewing time deposits for your reference we inserted slide 9 which provides the underlying interest rate detail of our loan portfolio our fourth quarter 2019 average loan yield of 4 91 declined by 20 basis points linked quarter our loan portfolio is largely variable rate and the most impactful interest rate indices for our loans are the prime rate in one month libor now turning to slide 10 total net interest income in the fourth quarter was 63 0 million compared to 51 5 million in the third quarter fee income and net gains on sales of loans totaled 52 5 million in the fourth quarter 3 increase from 51 million in the third quarter of 2019 interest rate contracts and other derivative income was 18 million in the fourth quarter a linked quarter increase of 9 million customer demand for interest rate hedging products continued to be strong in the fourth quarter and customer related revenue was 14 million an increase of 3 million quarter over quarter the associated credit valuation adjustment was 4 million in the fourth quarter a linked quarter increase of 6 million reflecting the interest the increase in long term interest rates at the end of the quarter moving on to slide 11 fourth quarter non interest expense was 193 million an increase of 9 linked quarter excluding amortization of tax credit investments and cdi our adjusted non interest expense was 165 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase of 4 quarter over quarter the largest change quarter over quarter was 3 2 million increase in compensation expense which was 101 million in the fourth quarter our fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 38 3 compared to 37 7 in the third quarter over the past five quarters our industry leading adjusted efficiency ratio has been under 40 our full year 2019 non interest expense was 735 million and excluding amortization of tax credit investments and cdi it was 645 million an increase of 4 year over year our full year adjusted 2019 efficiency ratio was 38 4 compared to 39 6 in 2018 the increase and non interest expense for the full year 2019 compared to 2018 was largely driven by an increase in compensation expense reflecting hires throughout the year to add talented bankers to our front line and to ensure that we continued to strengthen our risk management and support functions additionally in 2019 and continuing in 2020 we have been making ongoing and important investments in technology to better serve our commercial and consumer customers and to grow our market share in 2020 we will be launching a new fx system and a new commercial digital banking platform in hong kong which will provide our customers enhanced cross border payment and fx hedging capabilities as well as better interactivity with our domestic commercial digital banking platform furthermore we are continuing to build a new consumer digital banking platform tailored to the distinct needs of our consumer customer base inclusive of these investments in new systems and platforms and other ongoing efforts to invest in our business our outlook for 2020 assumes operating expense growth of 4 excluding amortization of tax credit investments and core deposit intangibles this is similar to the rate of operating expense growth in 2019 in slide 12 of the presentation we detail our critical asset quality metrics our allowance for loan losses totaled 358 million as of december 31 2019 our 1 03 of loans held for investment compared to 1 02 as of september 30 2019 and 96 basis points as of december 31 2018 non performing assets as of december 31 2019 were 122 million or 27 basis points of total assets compared to 31 basis points of total assets as of september 30 and 23 basis points of total assets as of december 31 2018 for the fourth quarter of 2019 our net charge offs were 8 million or annualized 10 basis points of average loans and we ve recorded a provision for credit losses of 19 million this compares to net charge offs of 22 5 million or annualized 26 basis points of average loans and a provision for credit losses of 38 million in the third quarter of 2019 included in the fourth quarter net charge offs of c i loans which totaled 11 million was 8 million full recovery on a c i loan as well as 5 million charge off on energy loan that had been placed on non accrual status earlier in the year other c i charge offs in the fourth quarter came from loans that were also previously on non accrual status and these have largely been reserved for as of september 30 2019 for the full year 2019 net charge offs were 53 million or 16 basis points of average loans compared to 13 basis points in 2018 full year 2019 provision for credit losses was 99 million compared to 64 million in 2018 overall asset quality continues to be stable quarter over quarter non performing assets and net charge offs decreased as of december 31 2019 classified and criticized assets totaled 974 million compared to 970 million as of september 30 2019 currently we estimate that the day one cecl related increase to our allowance for loan losses will be an increase of approximately 30 from the allowance for credit losses as of december 31 2019 our current outlook for 2020 projects at the day two provision for credit losses will range between 90 million and 120 million for 2020 this reflects our projected loan growth and our view that asset quality should be broadly similar in 2020 as in 2019 further the range of our provision outlook also takes into account the volatility that we expect to see a result of the forecast changes during 2020 that will drive the cecl model moving on to capital ratios on slide 13 east west capital ratios are strong tangible equity per share of 31 15 as of december 31 2019 grew 3 linked quarter and grew by 15 year over year the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio increased by 67 basis points year over year and our regulatory capital ratios increased by 45 to 75 basis points year over year east west board of directors has declared first quarter 2020 dividend for the company s common stock the common stock dividend of 0 275 is payable on february 14 2020 to stockholders of record on february 3 2020 and with that i ll move on to reviewing our 2020 outlook on slide 14 for the full year 2020 compared to our full year 2019 results we expect end of period loans to increase by 7 to 8 we expect that the gaap net interest margin will range between 3 40 and 3 45 our outlook incorporates no change to the fed funds rate in 2020 with this outlook for loan growth and net interest margin and reflecting the decline in interest rates in the second half of 2019 as well as declining accretion income in 2020 we expect that net interest income in 2020 will range from flat to growth of 2 year over year we expect non interest expense excluding the amortization of tax credit investments and core deposit premiums to increase approximately 4 we anticipate that the provision for credit losses will range between 90 million and 120 million finally we project that the effective tax rate will be approximately 15 for 2020 as we expect to continue to invest in tax credit investments we expect to make approximately 100 million of historic and clean energy tax credit investments in 2020 and project an amortization rate of approximately 85 for the first quarter of 2020 we currently expect tax credit amortization will be approximately 20 million with that i will now turn the call back to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng east west bancorp inc thank you irene i would now open the call to questions operator questions and answers operator our first question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer good morning ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst just first question dominic you talked about just the impact from the china trade dispute on the wholesale trade portfolio and there has been enough conversation around whether how meaningful that impact has been on your c i growth would love to get your thoughts around how you expect 2020 to play out for the c i lending both in terms of the specialty lending verticals where east west has been focused on and in terms of geographies and all the hiring that you ve done are you going into new markets like what is going to be in your view driving growth on the c i side dominic ng east west bancorp inc at this point i think that we expect the growth comes from many different industry verticals and then the general c i and also of course including greater china and our cross border business and we feel that in general there are different pockets of areas that would grow stronger than the others but the overall economic condition based on a more clarity with this us china dispute that result in the phase 1 signing gives many of the business and our customers more comfort to start investing and growing the business and in addition to that when you look at the agreement that was signed which call for china buying 200 billions more of goods from united states from the baseline of 2017 and that is 77 billion from 2020 and 123 billion in 2021 in the various sectors including manufacturing energy and services etc and we feel that clearly there are opportunities for some of our clients who are exporting to china and east west is going to pay attention to those opportunities to make sure that we get our share of banking business so all in all i would say that 2020 particularly in the second half and 2021 is looking pretty promising ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and just i guess on a separate topic you mentioned investments in the forex platform in hong kong and in the consumer digital platform here where should we see the benefits on the upsides of all those investments is it in higher fee revenue or better deposit growth and just kind of should we expect these to be needle movers in terms of growth dominic ng east west bancorp inc both i mean like obviously for the fx new system it will be predominantly for fee income but keep in mind when we have a strong fx value proposition that can be a lead in for us to get commercial banking business which will then result in loans and deposits too but that s more indirect i think the direct part will be fee income from the digital banking side that s really predominantly focused on our consumer core customer base and so for that i think will be consumer core deposits interest bearing checking account non interest bearing checking account so forth and we expect that there will be more core deposit coming and that will be in the next few years operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead chris mcgratty kbw analyst great thanks for the question i m interested credit quality obviously improved pretty notably sequentially there are some concerns i believe on residual effects of the energy stress in the third quarter could you provide maybe an update on what you re seeing in that portfolio maybe trends in classifieds and i believe there was a notable bankruptcy early in the quarter i m wondering if that s been addressed in the current reserve thanks irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer yes so if we look at the energy portfolio just to answer your question specifically the problem loans that we identified earlier in the year and talked about in a little bit more detail on last earnings call i think the good news is there really hasn t been a lot of new problem loans that have been identified the one loan that you are referring to was downgraded and in our views appropriately reserved for in the fourth quarter in total if you look at the balances as of september end of actually the outstanding balances as of the end of september for criticized and classified assets was about 68 million and as of the end of december that was 113 million non accrual loans same kind of levels for september were 21 million versus 33 million as of the end of december hopefully that helps to clarify some of those questions you had chris operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw wells fargo analyst hi good morning dominic ng east west bancorp inc good morning irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer good morning jared jared shaw wells fargo analyst looking at the growth expectation the loan growth expectations for 2020 is 7 to 8 does that assume that the wholesale trade business balances stay under pressure and if we saw more phase 2 or more confidence on the consumer or on the customer side could you see loan growth potentially be higher than that with the resumption of stronger wholesale trade lending dominic ng east west bancorp inc well i think that we expect a positive turnaround hopefully some time 2020 but now we have to keep in mind is that it s going to be a gradual process and if you look at as i indicated in my remarks earlier in fact normally in the fourth quarter we will have a search of the wholesale trade portfolio balances but last quarter we actually didn t and that s because everybody s holding out everyone knew that our president will be signing a phase 1 and so we all sort of stand in sideline and then so why do something until we see what exactly is going to be signed on and now that once we get that clarity i think people was going to start focusing on what need to be done some got great benefit because they are exporter to china some also even as importer because of the agreement of not putting tariff on those particular product or the agreement to drop from 15 to 7 5 that helps and then while others basically stay the same at that 25 tariff now the fact is even for those do have to pay tariff i mean in a way the good news is that now they know it s not jumping to 35 or 40 or 50 or is not having the very high uncertainty that s going on of the rhetorics coming from our president and so forth so in that standpoint people had dealt with those tariff and managed it for the last two years and managed them many of them had managed it pretty well in terms of whether it s cutting cost a little bit here and there having that chinese government to provide tax credit tax subsidy or just passed right through to us consumers and us consumers also seem to be taking those pass through very nicely as we ve seen in the retail report for the fourth quarter so far so all in all i see that there will be a little bit more normalization of trade activities going on in 2020 it s going to take a few months to ramp up and so i would expect that in the first two quarters we shouldn t be expecting a whole lot of substantial growth but then we ll be more or less maybe like last year but then in the third and fourth quarter it ought to be picking up that s what i see in the trade side but for the other portfolio i think will be more or less people looking at the general us economy that i think clearly with the uncertainty of trade dispute by the way is not just with china but also with many of the other countries have caused concern for many us business and now when the business overall see what the overall interest rate climate plus some of these settlements of the trade tariffs and so forth i think in general the business sentiment is getting a little bit more comfortable so we hope that the other c i verticals that we are will hopefully also be picking up a little bit so that s the assumption that we have and in terms of looking at 2020 outlook and beyond jared shaw wells fargo analyst thanks and then just circling back on capital management i know this is something i ve asked on other calls but capital continues to grow the tce ratio still growing and at substantial level what else should we be thinking about in terms of capital management with the growth in the similar range as we saw in 2019 i guess why not come in and do a buyback and help manage capital at this point dominic ng east west bancorp inc i think i would reiterate what we shared i think i guess in a more than two conference calls before that well first and foremost we are a management team that are shareholders friendly including our board by the way so we constantly at our board meetings evaluate and review this sort of opportunity cost of our capital should we should we not buyback and that i m pretty sure in our next board meeting we will have another very detailed discussion of this sort of alternative out there versus buyback one of the things that we do looked at though is that as we just shared in this earnings call we have well above industry average return of asset and return of equity our loan growth last year average loan growth is about 10 and so we are still doing pretty well and the other interesting part is that with this new dynamic that we are seeing right now that china have signed agreement in terms of better protect intellectual property and better protect companies who let s say are being pushed to transfer technology and china now have mechanism in place to penalize state owned enterprises or any government entities to do that so when we see there is a better clarity in these laws that attract foreign investment when the vice minister just announced that how much china wanted to attract foreign direct investments and in fact foreign direct investments in china even in 2019 have grown by a few percent and all of those are indication that we at east west bank wanted to make sure while we are looking at the obvious good choice of potential capital buyback we also need to balance to see that is it likely there ll be a great opportunity what is in the us or in greater china that we d want to further invest to ensure we have even stronger sustainable profitable performance for many years to come and i can only reflect back in the last 10 years we have deliberately spent our capital into investing in people and infrastructure which allow us to build such a very diverse loan portfolio and deposit portfolio so that allow at any particular time and year that if some particular sector slow down the other sectors picked up there are not many banks in the country that have a very evenly spread of c i cre and residential consumer portfolio that s spread out very nicely in different categories and allow us to put lever at a different time we would like to continue to further diversify our loan portfolio improve our fee income etc and so we ll continue to make those investments but at any point of time we feel that even with those investments and we still have excess capital that is redundant that obviously we will step in and start making a buyback so that s the plan operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet ubs analyst thank you for the question the derivatives business was obviously great quarter great couple of quarters here with the fed probably done should we be looking for this to kind of tail off or or not irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer yeah brock so if you look at 2019 from a customer revenue perspective the revenue from our interest rate contracts and other derivatives was 42 million net of the cda adjustment rounding there at 40 million when we look at 2020 although we are confident that we will be able to grow fee income line items among all other categories just given the nature of the rate curve the inversion earlier this year that really supported the volume increase we had in the third quarter in particular and second quarter we don t expect this level of customer revenue in 2020 for irc brock vandervliet ubs analyst got you ok and separately as you could imagine cecl is providing all sorts of fun with numbers for analysts irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer for us too brock vandervliet ubs analyst and as i look at your reserve at the true up and what you re anticipating for provisions can you help us dimension what you may be looking at in terms of charge offs is the number of 20 basis points is that reasonable to expect going forward or too high irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so brock that s a great question and i want to just kind of caution this is our view today for the day one reserve actually that may change as our models change our forecast change and there is some finalization that we re still doing in particular on the qualitative factors but given the call we wanted to share what our views were today and that is that 30 increase from the year end in current model calculation on day two we have traditionally given the guidance on the provision for the full year as you probably have noted the range that we re providing for the provision is wider and that s largely given our kind of view that compared to the incurred model likelihood is that there will be more volatility on the provision over the course of the year driven by kind of changes to the forecast so that s certainly that we re factoring overall when we will look at the credit environment we think it will be relatively the same and with those numbers we re modeling in kind of gross charge offs at similar levels to 2019 if that s helpful for you operator our next question comes from michael young with suntrust please go ahead michael young suntrust analyst hey good morning thanks for taking the question i wanted to ask about the sort of loan to deposit ratio i know dominic you mentioned that you wanted to continue to operate within the 90 to 95 range but given kind of where rates are and the stability here do you think that you would allow that maybe to drift higher as it may be easier to put on new deposits at lower rates now irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i think first and foremost we will always want to ensure that we have enough liquidity right and that we have enough core deposits to fund our loan growth that franchise value for bank is about core deposit franchise so that range that we have the 90 to 95 is a range that we re comfortable with at this point in time i do not think we ll inch that up much higher and to kind of more specifically address your question if we have the opportunity to reduce kind of bring on additional deposit at a lower cost what we ll probably do with that is let some of the higher operating higher cost deposits run out michael young suntrust analyst okay and then as a follow up i think at the beginning of last year you had mentioned a couple demand deposit focused initiatives particularly on the consumer side i just wanted to get an update if any of those were moving ahead or if we ve seen any benefits from those at this point dominic ng east west bancorp inc it went really well in 2019 and so with that momentum we will continue in 2020 so our consumer banking team specifically the retail branches are all geared up to keep going out there and bringing in small business customers one at a time and then we opened many many accounts last year and i expect them to continue to use their center of influence to help them cpa lawyers and so forth to help them to continue to open the small business account one at a time operator our next question comes from gary tenner with d a davidson please go ahead gary tenner d a davidson analyst thanks good morning irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer good morning gary gary tenner d a davidson analyst good morning i wanted to ask the question or a question on the 2020 loan growth outlook maybe a little different way if we look at 2019 the end of period year over year loan growth was a little over 6 and certainly pressured in the fourth quarter by not having wholesale trade benefit that you typically do so dominic given your comments about a better outlook for the back half of the year on wholesale trade as there are some more clarity for your customers why wouldn t that normalization maybe for 2020 help a better more positive rebound in overall loan growth is it the expectation of a slowdown or slower pace of growth in the other loan segments dominic ng east west bancorp inc well i think that overall what we project right now is based on our current activity and we do expect that some of these sort of positive momentum it s going to take a little bit time to ramp up so therefore and right now we prudently project to be 7 to 8 obviously we ll revise our guidance if we actually see even stronger momentum going forward gary tenner d a davidson analyst okay the rest of my questions were asked and answered so thank you dominic ng east west bancorp inc thank you operator our next question comes from david chiaverini with wedbush securities please go ahead david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst hi thanks a couple of questions for you so the first one i wanted to follow up on energy are you planning to grow the energy book or do you or conversely do you plan to reduce or exit this portfolio given the credit issues dominic ng east west bancorp inc at this point i don t think there is any it s going to be very low likelihood of any growth the reason is because obviously as everyone know in the industry that the equity investors hard to find in these days so therefore in order for us to do good deals we need to have strong equity partners to have us to put on senior debt quite frankly at this point right now i think the likelihood of what s growing is very very low i think that there will be a higher likelihood we d probably reduce the portfolio just naturally because of some paydown and so forth david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst thanks for that and then shifting gears more of a housekeeping question you mentioned about the guidance for tax credit amortization expense you said 20 million for the first quarter and you gave the full year amount but do you happen to have any guidance for the second quarter third quarter and fourth quarter irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer we do not at this point but you have the full year number and that will help you david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst yeah thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dominic ng for any closing remarks dominic ng east west bancorp inc well thank you all for joining the call first i wanted to apologize for a little bit of a confusion of my remarks earlier because my mind has already gone to celebrating the chinese lunar new year that will be coming this saturday by the way this is a very very special year the year of the golden rat it s one of one out of every 60 year that would happen it s the longest year ever for chinese new year because it s 384 days and there are a lot of special days throughout this year which i would see that many of our customers would have weddings give birth and starting new business etc etc so east west bank is going to be busy and so we hope that this most auspicious year that happens only once every 60 years will bring better fortune and success to everyone around the world and on behalf of all my associate at east west bank i would like to wish you all happy lunar new year thank you operator duration 55 minutes call participants julianna

the australian dollar was little changed marking what nab s tapas strickland called a full roundtrip over the last 24 hours the currency rallied as the latest jobs data pointed to a rethink on a potential rba rate cut next month and then it fell back as commodities prices sank overnight while no doubt the timing of rate cuts for h1 2020 is less certain given the solid jobs figures the rba still remains some distance away from full employment and we still expect the rba to cut rates in february as it downgrades its growth outlook on soft consumer data amid ongoing labour market spare capacity and little inflationary pressure mr strickland also said world health officials fear the transmission rate of the coronavirus could accelerate as hundreds of millions of chinese travel at

after months of anticipation president donald trump signed an interim phase one trade agreement the agreement with chinese vice premier liu he at the white house on january 15 2020 under the agreement reached after some 18 months of intense negotiations between trade officials of the two countries china has committed to improve the ability of u s businesses to operate in china china has agreed to revise its domestic intellectual property ip procedures and laws refrain from forced technology transfers improve regulatory approvals for u s agricultural and food products meet certain targets in purchasing u s origin goods and services and allow certain u s financial service providers to operate in china for its part the united states has agreed to suspend indefinitely its list 4b section 301 tariffs originally scheduled to go into effect on december 15 2019 and to reduce its list 4a section 301 tariffs imposed in september 2019 from 15 to 7 5 scheduled to take effect february 14 however for now the u s will maintain all the list 1 2 and 3 tariffs at 25 that still cover approximately two thirds of annual u s imports from china worth roughly us 300 billion the administration has indicated it intends to keep all those remaining section 301 tariffs in place as an incentive for china to abide by its phase one commitments and to negotiate and enter into a further phase two agreement that would deal with many significant and as yet unresolved trade and investment issues between the two nations the agreement contains individual chapters on ip technology transfer food and agriculture financial services macroeconomic policies and exchange rates chinese purchase targets for u s goods and services and dispute resolution we summarize below each of these chapters and conclude with some initial assessments of the agreement and its likely practical effects readers may also want to consult our earlier article concerning the background and context for the agreement here intellectual property designed to address one of the root causes of the trade dispute the ip chapter requires china to make specific amendments to its ip laws to protect foreign owners of ip rights while styled as reciprocal commitment to legal protections only china has affirmative obligations to adopt such new ip rules the agreement does not clarify the mechanisms by which china will adopt these rules whether by formal legislation administrative provisions or other policy guidance which could potentially leave room for future disputes about whether china has complied with this requirement however the agreement does provide that china must issue an action plan within 30 working days on how it intends to fulfill these requirements trade secrets china agreed to amend its trade secret law to cover electronic intrusions breaches of nondisclosure agreements and other unauthorized disclosures china will also revise its civil legal procedures to adopt a burden shifting framework in trade secret misappropriation cases so that the defendant would need to prove its innocence once the complainant has introduced sufficient evidence to withstand dismissal of the case china agreed that its courts will be more open to granting preliminary injunctions for threatened use of a trade secret in terms of criminal enforcement china also agreed it will be more willing to prosecute cases even in the absence of actual loss by the rights holder and will apply criminal laws to cyber thefts china also agreed to limit unnecessary requests by government agencies for information and to penalize unauthorized disclosures of trade secrets by government employees pharmaceutical ip china will create a nationwide system to notify the holder of a relevant chinese patent of any third party seeking to market a pharmaceutical product that may infringe upon such a patent and will allow the patent holder to seek judicial relief before any marketing approval is given for that third party s product patents china will adjust the duration of patent terms to compensate for unreasonable delays in approval and issuance of a chinese patent where the application process exceeds four years china will also adjust drug patent terms to compensate for delays in marketing approval for such drugs in china but china may limit that adjustment in the patent term to five years and cap a drug s patent term at 14 years from its market approval date e commerce piracy and counterfeits china will require expeditious takedown of online marketing of pirated goods immunize erroneous takedowns in good faith and punish major e commerce platforms for failing to remove ip infringing items geographic indications china will refrain from extending protection to generic geographic terms and will allow the united states to express objections when china negotiates a trade agreement with any third country that would put u s goods at a disadvantage manufacture and export of pirated or counterfeit goods china will curtail counterfeit drugs share information on the registration and inspection of pharmaceutical plants increase enforcement against other counterfeits including the destruction of counterfeits and the materials and implements used in their production and require chinese government agencies to use only licensed software subject to third party audits trademarks china will not enforce bad faith trademark registrations technology transfer this chapter requires that china refrain from compelled technology transfers as a condition for licensing or participation in joint ventures particularly where there is no regulatory need china also agreed not to direct outbound foreign investments to further its national industrial goals so that such outbound investments from china would only be made on a market basis although the u s trade representative ustr had cited such forced technology transfers in its section 301 report that formed the basis for all of the section 301 tariffs and the white house has frequently accused china of this kind of abuse this entire chapter is only two pages long moreover this chapter may be difficult to enforce given that an aggrieved u s company would need to raise its complaint with the ustr for a specific proposed or finalized transaction that also may be highly dependent on other chinese government approvals food and agriculture china agreed to certain regulatory measures intended to clear the way for more u s exports to china in addition china agreed to increase its purchase of u s agricultural commodities beyond certain baseline levels set in 2017 china agreed on a commodity specific basis to regulatory approvals and recognition of u s department of agriculture usda and food and drug administration fda standards that are intended to increase opportunities for u s exporters to china these include chinese acceptance of u s standards and certifications for dairy products poultry beef live cattle processed meat aquatic products rice potatoes nectarines blueberries avocadoes barley alfalfa feed additives distillers grains and pet and animal food china also agreed to administer tariff rate quotas trqs consistent with world trade organization wto rules and to allocate such trqs for wheat rice and corn before the beginning of the calendar year trqs are a common tariff based barrier that many countries including the united states itself which sets trqs on imported raw and refined sugar use to limit the total volume of certain imports especially in agricultural goods by increasing the tariff rate when certain fixed annual quotas for such imports from all foreign sources are exceeded in addition china committed to purchase more u s food and agricultural products relative to a 2017 baseline in particular the agreement requires that china purchase a minimum of agriculture goods of us 12 5 billion more in 2020 and us 19 5 billion more in 2021 than china did in 2017 however the agreement also states that such chinese purchases will be made according to market conditions which presumably means that china must want to import such goods to meet actual domestic chinese demand and further that u s prices for such products must then be at or below the prevailing market rate given how much emphasis china has placed upon these as market condition terms in the agreement it seems there could be less certainty to these purchase commitments than may seem apparent in addition the european union has already indicated that the agreement s minimum purchase requirements may violate wto rules on non discrimination among wto members manufacturing energy and services beyond the food and agricultural purchases china also agreed to increase its purchase of u s origin manufactured items energy products and services in particular china agreed to increase its purchases as follows china will increase purchases of u s manufactured goods by us 18 5 billion and us 33 9 billion respectively in 2020 and 2021 relative to 2017 purchases this part of the agreement includes industrial machinery electrical equipment pharmaceutical products aircraft automobiles medical instruments iron and steel and other manufactured goods china will increase purchases of u s energy commodities by us 33 9 billion and us 44 8 billion respectively in 2020 and 2021 relative to 2017 purchases this includes natural gas crude oil refined products and coal china will increase purchases of u s services by us 12 8 billion and us 25 1 billion respectively in 2020 and 2021 relative to 2017 purchases this includes services from the united states for ip travel and tourism financial services and insurance it related services and others as with agriculture and food products these chinese commitments are minimum purchase requirements and again subject to market conditions in china including actual domestic chinese demand and competitive pricing of u s products relative to comparable goods from other supplier nations financial services the agreement requires that china take a number of steps to ensure timely and fair treatment of regulatory approvals necessary for u s financial service providers to enter the market in china among these commitments are the following banking china will take into consideration the overseas assets of banks seeking government approval to provide securities investment fund custodial services in china with regard to underwriting non financial debt china will now take into account the other international qualifications of u s financial institutions as part of china s regulatory approval process credit rating china agreed to review and approve licenses for u s suppliers of credit rating services in china within three months both the u s and china agreed to allow credit rating services to acquire a majority ownership stake in a supplier s joint venture electronic payment services china agreed to accept applications from u s electronic payment service suppliers to operate in china and to decide on each such application within certain time limits measured from the application date distressed debt services china agreed to allow u s financial service firms to apply for licenses that would allow them to acquire non performing loans from chinese financial institutions and if granted to ensure national treatment of such u s firms insurance services china agreed to remove the 51 cap on foreign equity ownership for life pension and health insurance operators in china and thus for the first time to allow foreign insurance companies to own and operate wholly owned subsidiaries in china in these insurance lines securities china committed to consider review and approve qualified financial institutions for securities fund management and futures licenses china also agreed to remove the foreign equity cap for the securities fund management and futures sectors macroeconomic policy and exchange rates designed to address a long standing u s complaint about alleged currency manipulation this chapter merely affirms china s commitment to the terms of the international monetary fund and requires china not to engage in competitive currency devaluations to gain an advantage in export trade however in light of the trump administration s concurrent removal of its earlier u s treasury designation of china as a currency manipulator it is unclear what actual effect this provision will have on china s national currency the yuan dispute resolution china and the u s can contest whether the other party has fulfilled its obligations under the agreement which includes a section on dispute resolution initially each nation must undertake consultations at the sub ministerial level with the other nation concerning an alleged breach and must share certain information to help clarify points of disagreement if such consultations do not resolve the dispute then the ustr and a designated chinese vice minister would attempt to resolve the dispute bilaterally failing that the complaining party may begin to retaliate in a proportionate amount for the breach however if such retaliation is deemed by the other side to have been taken in bad faith the agreement then allows that side to withdraw from the agreement upon written notice thereof thus dispute resolution under the agreement will only be bilateral done through political channels between the two nations and without resort to arbitration or assessment by a neutral third party entity given recent history between the two countries on economic issues such a bilateral dispute resolution system could potentially escalate an issue and bring about the dissolution of the entire agreement for example if the united states disagrees that china is providing sufficient market access for u s firms to a specified sector of the chinese economy and takes some form of retaliatory action that china then considers to be disproportionate such as re imposition of punitive tariffs china could withdraw from the agreement only time and experience will tell how the two nations will manage such disputes to retain what each side sees as the advantages to stay within the agreement as importantly staying within the agreement likely is the only means toward a phase two deal that will deal with all the remaining stubborn issues such as chinese government subsidies for ostensibly private enterprises and the role and effect of chinese state owned enterprises and china s national industrial policies however one final thing remains crystal clear at this point all of the punitive 25 tariffs on goods covered by lists 1 2 and 3 and the 7 5 tariffs from list 4a will now remain in effect for the foreseeable future which means that u s importers and consumers will continue to bear the brunt of those tariffs indefinitely that reality is likely to cause chinese exporters to accelerate the diversification of their factory locations to third countries including mexico because of the favorable terms for goods made in mexico through the u s mexico canada agreement that both houses of congress have approved and sent to the president it will also spur on u s importers seeking to realign their supply chains and to avoid direct importation from china if their imports remain subject to the 25 tariffs under lists 1 2 or 3 or the remaining 7 5 tariffs under list 4a finally although items on list 4b are now sheltered from section 301 tariffs the united states likely would proceed to impose tariffs on list 4b items in the event of a perceived chinese breach of the agreement that is not addressed sufficiently in u s eyes through the prescribed dispute resolution mechanism
european central bank president christine lagarde was more upbeat thursday about risks to the eurozone economy and insisted climate change would be central to a rethink of the institution s goals and methods risks to the euro area remain tilted to the downside but have become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade is receding lagarde told reporters in frankfurt while an orderly brexit and a us china trade truce have cleared some of the air around trade president donald trump raised fears of a fresh row this week when he revived a threat to slap tariffs on european car imports but with european commission president ursula von der leyen set for us eu trade talks in washington next month the tone and the determination on both sides to draw positive conclusions i think is to be taken as a positive signal lagarde said as expected governors left interest rates at historic lows and maintained quantitative easing qe bond buying purchases at thursday s meeting the second chaired by lagarde since taking the helm in november they also officially kicked off a major strategic review expected to last all year we will not leave any stone unturned lagarde reiterated with the primary focus of the rethink how the bank defines its mandate of maintaining price stability and how best to pursue it the institution s last stock taking in 2003 took place several years before the global financial and economic crisis forced it into unprecedented stimulus action pressed by reporters on how she sees different aspects of policy developing lagarde said it would be unfair to preempt the outcome the toughest challenge will be how the ecb communicates about the review and the question of how to give a constructive outlet to differing opinions once it s over economist marcel fratzscher of german think tank diw said in a statement about the ecb s planned review the debate around the bank s inflation target took pride of place for most of its active life the ecb has aimed for inflation close to but below two percent to fulfil its mandate to keep eurozone prices stable over the past seven years it has failed to achieve that level despite unprecedented policy experiments including years of negative interest rates and over 2 6 trillion euros of qe one option would be to simply target inflation around two percent the ecb s monetary policy toolkit and communications were equally prominent in the statement lagarde said the bank would also look closely at the role the ecb could play in tackling climate change despite objections from the likes of german central bank chief jens weidmann to a green monetary policy lagarde said she had heard the concerns that climate action could be a distraction from the ecb s main price stability mandate but she warned of the danger of doing nothing failing to try is already failing she insisted hinting that the bank could look at increasing the share of green investments in its portfolio analysts from capital economics were unconvinced the ecb has little scope to tackle climate change they said in a note with some signs pointing to decreasing risks and a rebound from 2019 s growth slowdown this year policymakers will be hoping the ecb will be left in peace to determine its new direction without too many distractions a substantial change of the ecb s monetary policy before the end of the strategy review looks unlikely said ing bank analyst carsten brzeski binge worthy and nail biting ecb meetings will otherwise not return before the end of the review he added the international monetary fund lagarde s old patch this week pointed to a moderate pick up in global growth ahead although policy missteps could still derail it nevertheless some economists predict the ecb will lower rates further this year if no pickup in growth and inflation is forthcoming meanwhile qe is expected to continue at 20 billion euros 22 billion worth per month well into 2020

the australian dollar was little changed marking what nab s tapas strickland called a full roundtrip over the last 24 hours the currency rallied as the latest jobs data pointed to a rethink on a potential rba rate cut next month and then it fell back as commodities prices sank overnight while no doubt the timing of rate cuts for h1 2020 is less certain given the solid jobs figures the rba

warns imf after its latest checkup the current vulnerable state of the banking sector steeped in default loans poses the biggest danger to sustenance of bangladesh s tremendous growth momentum said the international monetary fund bangladesh logged in 8 15 per cent gdp growth last fiscal year after three consecutive years of more than 7 per cent expansion and is on track to surpassing the number this year the recent strong economic growth can continue only with a sound financial system that effectively allocates savings to more productive uses said the washington based multilateral lender in a report after its specialist team visited bangladesh last month as per latest central bank data which is of september last year default loans in the banking sector stood at tk tk 116 288 crore which is an all time high eight state run banks accounted for more than 50 percent of the default loans tk 59 622 crore high and increasing default loans and weak governance in the banking sector especially in state owned banks remain major policy challenges said the report which was handed in to the finance ministry and the bangladesh bank to address them the main priorities are a strict enforcement of existing legal and regulatory requirements an increase banking sector capital and a reform of the state owned banks with a clear separation of commercial and development functions the imf mission though welcomed ongoing efforts to strengthen the legal system to address banking sector weakness which should be completed in a timely manner the mission is sceptical about the success of the central bank s most recent loan rescheduling package it allowed defaulters to reschedule loans by providing 2 per cent down payment the move will lower the default ratio initially however without additional measures there are significant risks that the rescheduled loans will become defaults again it said the imf mission is also opposed to the idea of forming a public asset management company to take over banks toxic loans from them a draft act on this has already been formed considering the current regulatory and legal environment establishment of an asset management company poses significant fiscal risks the report also expressed reservations about the increase in government borrowing from the banking sector brought on by the sharp decline in savings certificate sales and slowdown in revenue growth while the increase in the deficit during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 20 was broadly matched by an increase in bank deposits the simultaneous reduction in savings certificate issuance added to the demand on bank funding subsequently private sector credit growth slowed down in november last year private sector credit growth dropped to 9 87 per cent which is the lowest since 2008 at least the bb s data goes as far back as 2008 while the imf welcomed the decline in savings certificate sales it called for stepped up efforts for a smoother transition to lower instrument issuance if the government s revenue deficit continues to widen without a sustained increase in deposit growth crowding out of private investment would increase with a possible adverse impact on growth improving revenue collection through a coordinated approach to expand the tax base and modernise tax administration remains a priority the report said collections grew just 4 83 per cent in the first four months of the fiscal year down from 6 74 per cent registered a year earlier this resulted in a significant widening of the fiscal deficit according to the imf specialist team subsequently they called for automation and introduction of electronic fiscal devices at the earliest as well as simpler vat structure with fewer non standard rates and exemptions the steps would help both increase revenue and streamline tax administration given weak revenue collection and likely increases in various subsidies including for liquefied natural gas imports keeping the budget deficit within 5 per cent of gdp while protecting priority social spending and implementing the budgeted investment spending could become challenging the bb should continue to monitor inflation developments closely and stand ready to adjust its stance it said inflation expectations remain elevated it said bangladesh s average inflation crept up four basis points to 5 59 per cent in 2019 which saw fluctuations throughout the year and a skyrocketing of the price of onion an essential cooking ingredient full year inflation averaged 5 7 percent in 2017 and 5 55 percent in 2016 according to data from the bangladesh bureau of statistics the central bank should also continue to increase exchange rate flexibility to help buffer the economy against external shocks the report said export diversification remains another priority for the government the imf mission said recent export contraction in the garment sector shows risks from excessive reliance on this sector for export growth export earnings fell 5 84 per cent year on year to 19 3 billion in the first six months of the fiscal year on the back of lower shipment of apparel items the shipment of apparel which usually makes up more than 80 per cent of national exports fell 6 21 per cent to 16 02 billion according to data from the export promotion bureau within the garment sector moving to a wider variety of higher value added goods and expanding to different markets would help buffer external shocks improving the business environment would help attract foreign direct investment support the creation of new export industries and help nascent industries grow stimulating higher economic growth over the medium term the imf also suggested a heatmap for bangladesh to keep track of monthly economic development for efficient and proactive macroeconomic management heatmaps which are two dimensional visual representations of data using colours where the colours all represent different values enable an efficient and comprehensive overview of a topic at a glance the multilateral lender also plans to help bangladesh offset the social impact of automation preliminary results suggest that occupations most vulnerable to automation judged by the average risk of automation being above 70 per cent account for about 60 per cent of the current labour force the occupations include clerical workers agricultural workers plant and machine operators and other elementary occupations the imf report added an imf team will arrive in march to help the country with the issues

the once and future worker a vision for the renewal of work in america oren cass encounter books 25 99 cloth in a december 2019 speech at national defense university on american industrial policy and the rise of china senator marco rubio made a forceful case for industrial policy rooted both in geopolitical rivalry and in domestic politics when dignified work particularly for men goes away so goes the backbone of our culture dismissing conservative canards about laissez faire markets and economic efficiency rubio described a new national conservative dirigisme an emerging and much contested strand of republican policy argument this newfound economic nationalism of the right embraced by rubio donald trump and foreign analogues such as boris johnson commands high levels of political support precisely because it abandons traditional conservative economic dictums the newfound economic nationalism of the right commands high levels of political support precisely because it abandons traditional conservative economic dictums the most compelling statement of the intellectual foundations of a conservative industrial policy can be found in oren cass s the once and future worker cass chief policy advisor to mitt romney in 2012 articulates a modern version of worker centered economic nationalism besides the political novelty of the economic project cass also offers a contrarian take on labor market policies and institutions rejecting both free market prescriptions of past republicans as well as the job protection oriented policies of the left i was at first puzzled why cass chose an apparently contradictory source for his book s title t h white s celebrated fantasy novel the once and future king 1958 ends with a wizened king arthur pondering the natural environment and the folly of conflict based on fictions of political geography he concludes that freedom of trade and free passage and access to the world should characterize the relationship among diverse nations but cass s book articulates an intelligent view of how the labor market works his hypothesis is simple work particularly in tradable sectors such as energy and manufacturing has considerable benefits above and beyond wages family formation local spillovers onto other businesses low crime rates and cohesion of local community all follow from thriving industrial employment he notes that the production of tradeable goods benefits small towns in a way that services do not that the homogenization of work schedules contra jobs in the gig economy allows coordination of non work social activities and that interactions at work form meaningful friendships and dense social networks these externalities mean that the social value of jobs exceeds the wages paid to workers and the revenue accrued by employers these jobs ought to be subsidized by policy cass argues because the market will underprovide them cass also identifies a number of more debatable internalities which such jobs supposed provide workers beyond the wages they are paid notably he argues that the work fosters a variety of bourgeois behaviors such as punctuality hygiene and reliability the book s policy proposals flow from this perspective the most interesting implications are the need for interventionist market distorting mechanisms sacrificing more easily measured efficiency and gdp growth in favor of increased low skill employment impeding globalization from trade liberalization to immigration where it reduces demand for american workers despite consumer price increases and privileging locally tailored voluntary collective bargaining agreements over federal employment regulations the book conveys a commitment to the deep polanyian truth about the labor market workers are people with diverse tastes and skills that are difficult to price in the market an economy that has something for everyone that is as good at allocating dignified remunerative work to the computer illiterate fifty five year old as to the twenty three year old coding dynamo would be more egalitarian culturally and materially the book conveys a commitment to the deep polanyian truth about the labor market workers are people with diverse tastes and skills that are difficult to price in the market this is why more perfect unions in which cass describes a conservative vision of collective bargaining is the book s most interesting chapter cass recognizes the inequality in bargaining power between employers and individual workers and understands that collective bargaining might mitigate that power instead of the traditional unions protected by the national labor relations act nlra he envisions a competing ecosystem of nonprofit coops that would negotiate with employers in exchange for voluntary dues payments like unions these coops would be granted exclusive bargaining rights but they could not compel dues nor engage directly in political activity these coops would not necessarily bring about good labor relations nor skilled loyal workers but the ability to contract around federal regulations thus their added value is that they would let an employer bargain with workers around federal defaults coops would add flexibility rather than reduce it this is a promising idea but the devil is in the details why would the employer have to negotiate with the coop cass is silent on the role of strikes and the vital ability of collective bargaining units to threaten economic harm on their generally wealthier partner in the event of an impasse current labor law allows permanent replacement workers during strikes defanging unions effective threat and severely reducing any benefits of collective bargaining while nobody likes acrimonious costly strikes their unexercised threat underpins the bargaining power that cass deems necessary we should want powerful disruptive strikes to be safe legal and rare cass would also prohibit multi employer bargaining when in fact this is needed many pathologies of u s unions flow from the contractual jurisdiction that limits bargaining to one establishment reducing incentives to internalize effects on other employers and workers sectoral wage boards the extension of collective bargaining agreements to all workers in a sector joint employer liability and bargaining with firms higher up the value chain such as the coalition of immokalee workers securing agreements with companies such as mcdonald s to source their products in ways that benefit farmworkers would all update collective bargaining to increase worker coverage under a single agreement as owners of firms are increasingly distant financialized and concentrated the scope of a labor action required to pressure an employer is much larger than it was collective bargaining must therefore expand beyond the firm based entities protected by the nlra further to have bargaining power unions must finance strike funds staff and lawyer pay and other expensive services without the ability to compel dues unions would spend all their time campaigning while the problem that worries cass unresponsive and corrupt unions coasting on coerced dues is real it is also rare and there are better mechanisms to ensure accountability than eliminating agency fees cass could have proposed a voluntarily compelled dues structure that was like an assurance contract everyone commits to pay contingent on at least 50 percent of workers paying cass could also have suggested a matching funds approach where governments match workers voluntary dues but cass leaves his coops with no sword and no shield why would an intransigent businesses bargain with them cass leaves his coops with no sword and no shield why would an intransigent businesses bargain with them there is nonetheless merit in the idea of a grand bargain between left and right over unions the goal would be unions that can bargain around federal employment regulations like overtime pay or even minimum wage but whose ability to strike is protected replacement workers would be banned and right to work repealed a pro union republican party wouldn t have to worry as cass does about unions as democratic vote banks rather than hiring consultants to legally decimate union activists inside a shop employers would have incentives to work with the federal government could demand meaningful national standards knowing that there is a pro worker opt out for companies that find it too costly and large encompassing multi employer unions would eagerly seek the additional dues revenue and target low income areas that find federal employment regulation extra onerous but cass does not ask for real economic power for unions and this is symptomatic of the book s missed opportunity to make the case for a pro worker policy agenda while he might reject laissez faire in his enthusiasm for jobs he isn t willing to confront owners large and small whose untrammeled insistence on the primacy of profits have led to many of the ills cass identifies indeed cass misattributes what made jobs in traditional tradable sectors good basically union imposed high wages good working conditions and seniority schedules ensuring job security before nlra unions manufacturing jobs were in fact terrible high turnover low wage enterprises hardly living up to cass s fantasies about independent and self sufficient workers steadfast in their communities whole towns would completely change population over short windows of time with extraordinarily few workers staying put and ascending into skilled or management positions or consider the status of coal workers in weakened union environments today such as the twenty nine massey workers killed in 2010s upper big branch mine a direct consequence of union busting practices in the 1980s what made cass s ideal jobs ideal was not any self sufficiency inherent in the physical labor in tradeable goods it was union contracts negotiated in the shadow of credible threats to hurt the profits of their employers even in non union manufacturing transplants in the south the perpetual threat of union organizing helps keep wages high and working conditions good much of what cass finds attractive about traditional sectors was won by an insurgent labor movement and then maintained by brute political maneuvering in the face of employer hostility the once and future worker refuses to hold the owning class responsible for stagnant wages and unfulfilling work at the low end of the labor market cass cannot bring himself to systematically punch up instead of down and so he can only envision policies that improve workers fortunes without harming those of their bosses and their bosses bosses perhaps driven by his conservative audience cass poses tradeoffs between the welfare of an imagined heartland industrial worker and somebody outside the republican coalition an immigrant a foreign power a liberal professional or a metropolitan service sector worker his enemies line up with the culture war not the class war and he clearly doesn t think the institutional or individual concentration of economic power is either real or a real problem for a good jobs agenda the silences in cass s book on weakened antitrust enforcement increased transfers to shareholders hypertrophied finance and low pay high turnover practices of employers are perhaps predictable from a conservative writer he opens the book lamenting stagnant wages but doesn t mention the skyrocketing stock market and the resulting agenda of ostensibly pro worker policies constrained by u s profit margins can t help but be cramped despite some new policy ideas cass is still conservative in politics unwilling to challenge the discretion of employers industrialists and financiers to determine the level of employment the drive to line shareholder and financial industry pockets got us outsourcing even without globalization it contributed to ever increasing consolidation in u s businesses generated hr practices coordinated on low wages and high quits incentivized firms to overstaff on supervisors and understaff line workers overinvest on monitoring technology and underinvest on productivity improvements all to economize on wages per unit of effective labor increased wage setting power union busting declining federal minimum wages undignified levels of workplace surveillance and routinization and consolidation in small town tradables all have contributed to lower wages and lower employment the neoliberal playbook empowering shareholders and constraining unions cutting taxes at the top and curbing minimum wage growth at the bottom is the basic force that despoiled the labor market for non college educated workers some of cass s prescriptions do in fact curb neoliberal policies such as free trade but most don t keeping faith that the job creating class is in fact interested in creating dignified good paying jobs rather than maximizing profits for themselves and their capital suppliers even in non union manufacturing transplants in the south the perpetual threat of union organizing helps keep wages high and working conditions good cass s political limitations create many missed opportunities for ideas about creating good jobs cass could have discussed what a robust high road employment industrial policy could look like current technological change is driven by financial arbitrage advertising revenue and the defense advanced research projects agency ecosystem none of which have any particular interest in raising the productivity of low education workers but modern manufacturing systematically declining as a share of employment since the 1950s has extremely high value added per worker so it is extremely unlikely that manufacturing will ever account for a huge share of employment in the near future beyond manufacturing one could imagine building on technologies for example via u s national grand engineering challenges that make human decision making and judgment integral parts of artificially intelligent systems raising productivity of both humans and machines in the process cass thinks a small town getting an automated 3 d printing hub owned by a conglomerate will experience a stunning revival but he ignores the job creating parts of climate change adaptation and mitigation generated by a much less science fictiony green new deal instead he bemoans epa regulations that hem in an energy sector that employs fewer workers than walmart a book that truly cared about jobs more than bondholders would also discuss how to run the macroeconomy hot for a generation it would praise a willingness to risk creditor wrath over inflation and austerian wrath over deficits in exchange for massive infrastructure spending and unemployment around 1 percent as the recovery from the great recession fades we may see many of the nascent positive social changes wrought by a decade of employment growth especially pressure to raise wages wither and die before taking hold a more systematic approach to maintaining high effective demand where workers can quit their jobs easily and fearlessly could begin the road of repairing labor s share of national income cass could have explored what parts of big government make it a net contributor to employment particularly for women in his 2014 paper how can scandinavians tax so much henrik jacobsen kleven argues the answer is that the public expenditures are so complementary to labor supply public and cheap high quality childcare elder care health care including family planning not contingent on a particular employer and education alongside high quality public transportation are all things that make working easier for individuals and families and incentivize work even in the face of otherwise rebellion inducing taxation in the united states we restrict reproductive freedom give ten weeks maternity leave and demand that prime age working households juggle care of their parents and children while paying down their student loans and waiting in traffic jams while on phone calls with insurance administrators a healthy library of high quality public options would raise attachment to work for both men and women even on globalization the one place where cass is willing to impinge on employer choice he focuses on product markets and immigration an honest criticism of globalization would include a criticism of tax arbitrage and global corporate tax evasion which forces government revenue to be generated from middle class labor income taxes cass evades discussing the increase in the use of tax havens by the ultra wealthy and the lax irs enforcement of high value tax dodgers most disappointingly predictable is cass s enthusiasm for wage subsidies essentially a more salient monthly earned income tax credit decoupled from children as preferable to welfare basic incomes or minimum wages while the research is in flux work suggests roughly thirty cents of each dollar of eitc money actually paid to low skill single mothers is captured by employers and eitc fraud among the self employed is rampant similar effects would obtain with the wage subsidy lowered wages for those already in the labor market incentives to form fake llc employers and claim the credit and blunted incentives to search or ask for a raise while the safety net is partially a transfer to workers a work subsidy is partially a transfer to employers beyond its missed opportunities the book suffers from a selective and sloppy review from howlers about the stuff intensity of modern consumption and the postwar neglect of employment to pretty dishonest presentations of the evidence on minimum wage and immigration examples cited as evidence are cherry picked and unconvincing to the extent that intellectuals should agree on how the world is even as they disagree on how it should be a fair representation of the evidence is required promoting a pro work supply side and deregulatory agenda is an interesting but ultimately self limiting endeavor at the end of the day promoting a pro work supply side and deregulatory agenda is an interesting but ultimately self limiting endeavor cass is only able to consider policies that hurt foreigners and coastal professionals not those that hit millionaire business owners the c suites or the stock market the book stands as a compelling exhibit of corey robin s dictum that regardless of the particular domain or policy prescriptions the basic conservative animus is restoration of privilege lost to subordinates even while giving up the free market national conservatism cannot give up the rule of the wealthy the privilege redeemed by cass s book belongs to the white male industrial worker against depredations of developing countries migrant workers more feminine occupations and the environmental claims of future generations but never against his employers landlords or creditors

treasurer jamie leonard following prepared remarks by greg and tayfun we will open the call for questions let me turn over the call now to greg for his comments greg d carmichael chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thanks chris and thank all of you for joining us this morning earlier today we reported record full year 2019 net income of 2 5 billion or 3 33 per share full year adjusted net income of 2 1 billion was also a record for the bank as i reflect on the past year i m very pleased with the significant progress we made positioning fifth third for long term success in addition to the record net income we generated our best full year core return on tangible common equity excluding aoci in over a decade up 120 basis points from last year we produced our lowest efficiency ratio in over a decade which decreased 160 basis points from last year we generated peer leading household and deposit growth all while reducing deposit cost during the year also during the year we successfully integrated mb financial we added significant scale in the chicago market and expect to generate even stronger deposit household and revenue growth going forward we successfully navigated the evolving interest rate environment as our full year 2019 core net interest margin expanded 5 basis points after expanding 18 basis points in the year before which is at the higher end of our peer group we generated record fee income including corporate banking as our capital markets business generated double digit revenue growth for the second consecutive year we also generated record revenue in wealth and asset management while generating positive inflows every quarter during the year net charge offs and other key credit metrics remained at or near historically low levels throughout the year we generated nearly 0 5 billion of excess capital through worldpay transactions in 2019 which is yet to be deployed and we returned over 110 of adjusted earnings to shareholders in 2019 through a 27 increase in our dividend and through share repurchases in summary we are extremely pleased with the progress we have made and expect to build on our strong performance in 2020 and beyond for the fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders was 701 million or 0 96 per share reported results included a positive 0 28 primarily from the successful worldpay tax receivable agreement transactions completed during the quarter since the spin off of our processing business 10 years ago we have generated over 7 billion in pre tax value for our shareholders with another 195 million remaining in tra income which will be fully realized over the next five years tayfun will discuss the fourth quarter tra transaction in more detail our fourth quarter financial results were very strong reflecting our prior north star investments to further diversify our revenue streams prudent balance sheet management continued expense discipline and our success in achieving the targeted financial outcomes from the mb financial acquisition we generated very strong fee revenue including a new record in capital markets our net interest income results once again reflect our ability to successfully manage the balance sheet despite the lower rate environment which led to strong nim performance in the quarter we continue to manage our expenses diligently this reflects our continued focus on generating efficiencies throughout the bank while still investing in high priority areas to support revenue growth we remain on track to achieve the 255 million in annual savings from the mb acquisition by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and are excited about the revenue synergies that are emerging loan growth during the quarter was consistent with our previous guidance reflecting the generally subdued macroeconomic environment total commercial loans were stable and consumer loans were up 1 sequentially following our trend we successfully generated strong core deposit growth while proactively reducing deposit cost more than our previous guidance our average loan to core deposit ratio of 90 is the lowest in over 15 years credit results during the quarter were partially impacted by our conversion to a national charter excluding this impact net charge offs were up just 1 basis point sequentially with consumer flat and commercial up 2 basis points provision was primarily impacted by growth in specific reserves related to a couple of commercial loans before i turn over to tayfun to discuss our results and outlook i d like to once again emphasize our strategic priorities to outperform through the cycle and generate long term shareholder value as i mentioned we have been very successful in executing our priorities throughout 2019 and have delivered on our targeted outcomes as expected we will continue to focus on these priorities going forward including leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation investing in talent capabilities and process improvements to generate relationship growth and improve profitability continue to expand our presence in select geographies focusing on high growth markets we are investing in the southeast footprint with better deposit growth trends higher expected population growth and greater market vitality and lastly we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach throughout the company to that end our capital allocation priorities are organic balance sheet growth fee generating non bank acquisitions paying a strong dividend and share repurchases bank acquisitions are not a priority our medium term cet1 capital target remains at approximately 9 5 we plan to increase our dividend another 0 03 this quarter subject to board approval we expect to execute our remaining buybacks from ccar 2019 our clearly defined strategic growth priorities our proactive balance sheet management and our ongoing discipline throughout the bank position us well for the future we continue to focus on striking the appropriate balance in order to generate positive operating leverage this year while continuing to invest for long term performance i m pleased to report that we were again able to deliver strong financial results our strong performance this quarter was a direct result of our employees hard work and dedication to keeping the customer at the center of everything we do with that i ll turn it over to tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you greg good morning and thank you for joining us today let s move to the financial highlights on slide 4 of the earnings presentation we are pleased with our overall financial performance and strong finish to a strong year similar to the trends all year during the fourth quarter our net interest income net interest margin non interest income and non interest expenses all performed in line or better than our october guidance reported results for this quarter were positively impacted by 0 28 per share from several notable items the most significant was a 265 million after tax gain from the worldpay tra transaction which added approximately 20 basis points to our cet1 ratio similar to all of the strategic decisions related to our legacy processing business over the past 10 years the tra transaction creates significant value for our shareholders by monetizing gross cash flows that previously expected to occur primarily from 2025 until 2035 consequently we are also no longer exposed to fis taxable income capacity in the future related to those cash flows and we still have multiple years of annual benefits impacting our fee income in the future we provide more information on the transaction in our presentation appendix in addition to the tra transaction reported results were also affected by a 34 million after tax negative mark related to the visa total return swap a 15 million after tax contribution to the fifth third foundation and a 7 million after tax impact from mb merger related charges additionally our quarterly results were negatively impacted by a 7 million after tax impact to provision for credit losses resulting from our conversion to a national charter our earnings materials provide more information on the various credit metrics that are affected by this conversion adjusting for those items and the purchase accounting impact shown in our earnings materials fourth quarter pre provision net revenue increased 14 from the prior year our core return on tangible common equity excluding aoci also increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 14 8 while our tangible book value per share increased 10 from last year our goal is to carry the revenue momentum forward while maintaining tight expense control we will continue to manage balance sheet risk by remaining cognizant of the environmental factors and maintain a prudent approach to capital management with the ultimate goal of rewarding our shareholders today and in the future moving to slide 5 total average loans were flat sequentially as consumer grew 1 and commercial was stable from the prior quarter our focus continues to be on generating higher quality loan growth to maximize our returns through the full cycle in our commercial business similar to last quarter strong production levels in both regional middle market and corporate banking were offset by elevated payoffs we have experienced higher than usual payoffs this quarter in our leveraged lending and structured finance portfolios as well as in our construction portfolio new loan production in regional middle market banking has increased every quarter since the first quarter of 2019 our new loan originations particularly in cincinnati chicago and florida were strong in the fourth quarter total commercial line utilization was stable in commercial leasing our balances continued to decline due to our 2018 decision to hold new originations in our large ticket indirect segment and focus on driving relationship oriented growth we expect to see lease balances decline by approximately 300 million by the end of 2020 as a result beyond 2020 this impact should be lower average commercial real estate loans were up 1 from last quarter primarily reflecting draws on prior period commitments our cre balances as a percentage of total risk based capital remained very low at less than 80 commercial loan growth will likely remain relatively muted in the near term reflecting the subdued environment for corporate capital investments we will continue to maintain our focus on client selection and prudent underwriting in the best long term interest of our shareholders average total consumer loans grew 1 from last quarter predominantly driven by strong auto loan production of 1 7 billion within the same risk return profile that we have targeted for the past number of years the decline in home equity balances continues to reflect high levels of payoffs and paydowns our credit card growth continues to track in line with the industry the residential mortgage portfolio was flat sequentially we expect this portfolio to remain flat for the foreseeable future barring any significant changes in the interest rate environment in the first quarter we expect total average loan balances to remain relatively stable sequentially for the full year 2020 we expect average loans to increase approximately 4 relative to last year with growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios moving on to slide 6 reported net interest income declined 1 compared to the prior quarter the purchase accounting adjustments benefited our fourth quarter nii by 18 million and our net interest margin by 5 basis points compared to 28 million and 7 basis points in the third quarter adjusting for purchase accounting accretion nii was relatively flat with just a 4 million decrease sequentially interest income benefited a couple of million dollars from seasonal dividends the adjusted fourth quarter nim of 3 22 decreased 3 basis points from the third quarter adjusted nim which was better than our october guidance of down 4 basis points to 5 basis points our relative nim performance throughout this cycle this rate cycle has been outstanding our focus on reducing our overall interest bearing liability costs to offset the impact of lower market rates remains very high interest bearing core deposit rates were down 19 basis points during the quarter better than our previous guidance range of 15 basis points to 18 basis points we expect interest bearing core deposit costs in the first quarter to decline approximately another 8 basis points to 10 basis points from the fourth quarter assuming the fed remains on hold combining our first quarter forecast with the results of the past three quarters we will achieve a cumulative 30 basis point decline in interest bearing core deposit costs since the fed started lowering interest rates last year resulting in a 40 beta on a core basis we expect first quarter nim to expand 1 basis points to 2 basis points from the fourth quarter core nim of 3 22 reflecting the increasing benefit from the forward starting hedge positions that became effective over the past few months for the full year 2020 we continue to expect core nim to be 3 25 consistent with our october guidance and down just 2 basis points from our core 2019 nim assuming no fed rate cuts this year for the full year we currently expect net interest income excluding purchase accounting adjustments to increase approximately 2 we expect our first quarter net interest income excluding purchase accounting adjustments to decline approximately 2 sequentially impacted by day count and the relatively stable loan growth outlook our first quarter outlook also assumes partial reinvestment of the investment portfolio cash flows which may change depending on the environment moving on to slide 7 we had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided to in october adjusted non interest income decreased only 2 sequentially as deposit fees and corporate banking fees performed better than expected offsetting a portion of the seasonal decline in mortgage revenues continuing its recent trends corporate banking fees exceeded our guidance our capital market teams generated record revenues this quarter up 10 from the third quarter for the full year our capital markets fees were up 12 following 15 year over year growth in 2018 we are very pleased with the second half revenue strength in capital markets especially the growth from our regional banking client activities our focus on client selection and deepening those relationships is working well to diversify our revenue streams the power of our one bank model which engages all business lines in meeting our clients needs is very visible in our financial results we generated very strong 30 growth in corporate banking revenue in 2019 relative to 2018 reflecting the investments we have made in our north star project in talent and in advanced capabilities to better serve our clients as we anticipated the return to those investments will continue to reward our shareholders mortgage banking revenue decreased 23 to 73 million sequentially and increased 35 relative to the fourth quarter of 2018 origination volume of 3 8 billion was up 13 from the prior quarter our gain on sale margin was 156 basis points in the quarter impacted by seasonally lower application volumes in the quarter and tightening primary secondary spreads wealth and asset management revenue increased 4 from the prior quarter due to higher personal asset management fees we finished the year very strong in new aum flows and expect this trend to continue in 2020 deposit service charges were up this quarter with higher fees in consumer as well as commercial we expect a stronger year in 2020 in our consumer and commercial deposit service charges based on the trend that we are seeing our 2019 non interest income results demonstrate the increasing benefit of having a platform with a wide scope of product and service capabilities for the full year 2020 we expect core non interest income growth of approximately 8 relative to the adjusted 2019 level of 2 711 billion including the expected worldpay tra benefit in the fourth quarter we expect first quarter non interest income to decline approximately 3 reflecting seasonally lower mortgage and interchange revenue our first quarter forecast also does not include any investment gains in total as a result of nii growth and strong increase in fees we expect to achieve a very strong 4 total revenue growth in 2020 moving on to slide 8 fourth quarter reported pre tax expenses included merger related items totaling 9 million intangible amortization expense of 14 million and a contribution to the fifth third foundation of 20 million adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials non interest expense was flat sequentially we remain on track to deliver on the previously provided outlook for mb related expense savings we continue to expect to achieve 255 million in savings by the end of the first quarter of 2020 additionally we expect our total after tax merger charges inclusive of the merger related charges recognized in current and past periods as well as projected future charges to be approximately 245 million after tax which is 5 million lower than our deal estimate as is always the case for us our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes excluding these seasonal items we would expect our total expenses in the first quarter to be down approximately 1 sequentially total first quarter expenses including the seasonal items are expected to be up approximately 5 from the adjusted fourth quarter which also includes the full impact of the 3 raise in our minimum wage to 18 an hour although in the short term the increase in minimum wage is dilutive in the long run we expect to achieve a stronger financial outcome through lower turnover improved workforce quality lower recruiting expenses and more effective training for the full year there are a number of discrete one time changes including the impact of the minimum wage increase and the increase in direct regulatory fees related to the occ charter conversion in addition we are planning to continue to rationalize and modernize our technology infrastructure which will result in additional in year expense growth relative to our recent trends these three unique items are expected to increase our total expenses by approximately 1 we are anticipating a minimal increase in discretionary expenses outside of these items excluding these unique items affecting 2020 total expenses should increase less than 2 in total including these items we expect total adjusted expenses to increase between 2 and 3 compared to adjusted 2019 non interest expenses of 4 372 billion which reflects growth in expense items tied to strong revenue performance that i mentioned regardless of our 12 month outlook which calls for positive operating leverage resulting from strong revenue and disciplined expense growth in this uncertain macroeconomic environment we intend to maintain flexibility to achieve positive operating leverage under potentially less favorable economic conditions we recognize that as we navigate through the environment investments in projects with lower returns may be de emphasized or delayed in order to focus our capital investments in the highest areas of importance within the four strategic corporate priorities turning to credit results on slide 9 due to our national charter conversion fourth quarter credit results were impacted by accounting policy changes to conform to occ guidance regarding certain assets which resulted in an increase in tdr and oreo balances these changes increased consumer npls by 83 million and npas by 113 million which added 7 basis points to the npl ratio and 10 basis points to the npa ratio the same change resulted in a one time 10 million increase in charge offs all within our consumer portfolio excluding the one time occ impact net charge offs remained at historically low levels during the quarter the consumer net charge off ratio was flat and commercial was up 2 basis points sequentially the adjusted npa and npl ratios continue to be benign and in line with the levels that we have seen all year the alll ratio increased slightly to 1 1 of portfolio loans and leases driven largely by two factors the larger portion of the increase was due to higher specific reserves for two middle market commercial loans in two different industries we expect these loans to go through our resolution process in the first or second quarter we also increased the allowance in our credit card portfolio as the incurred loss methodology captured the uptick in historical loss rates as we discussed before the higher credit card loss rates are related to growth in certain promotional test portfolios which are expected to run off and result in more normalized charge offs toward the end of the quarter end of the year card charge offs were actually down 20 basis points this quarter compared to third quarter with respect to the cecl adoption which is in effect as of january 1 the day one adjustments will result in an increase of approximately 48 to 50 or between 645 million and 675 million to our allowance for credit losses which includes reserves for unfunded commitments and is below the upper end of the range that we provided in october as a reminder this increase includes the impact of the mb acquisition accounting methodology pertaining to our non pci loan portfolio and the cecl treatment of reserves which adds more than 10 to the increase that i mentioned as discussed previously excluding the impact of mb we expect reserves for commercial loans to decrease and consumer and mortgage loans to increase relative to the incurred loss methodology we plan to include a full description and transition details in our upcoming 10 k disclosure consistent with peer banks who have recently commented on the impact of cecl given the number and potential volatility associated with the underlying variables supporting the cecl methodology we expect more volatility in our quarterly provision expense our calculations for the allowance for credit losses rely on various models and estimation techniques utilizing historical losses borrower characteristics economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast as well as other relevant factors for expected losses in our reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years we will use three macroeconomic scenario from there we assume losses revert to historical levels over a period of two years on a straight line basis given the multiple variables impacting provision expense under cecl we will be providing forecast for net charge offs for the foreseeable future overall we expect our full year 2020 charge offs to remain near historically low levels and be in the 35 basis point to 40 basis point range which is up just a few basis points compared to the 36 basis point to 37 basis point charge off rates that we have seen in the last couple of quarters again i would like to remind you that the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential fluctuations in losses on a quarter to quarter basis given the current low absolute levels of charge offs turning to slide 10 capital levels ended the year very strong our common equity tier 1 ratio was 9 7 and our tangible common equity ratio excluding aoci was 8 4 our tangible book value per share was 21 13 this quarter up 10 year over year during the quarter we completed 300 million in buybacks which reduced our share count by approximately 10 million shares or about 1 5 of our common shares outstanding compared to the third quarter we expect to execute the remaining approximately 600 million of repurchases over the remaining two quarters in this ccar cycle between the worldpay sale gains in the first quarter of 2019 and the impact of the recent tra transaction we have nearly 0 5 billion of additional capital above our initial expectations as we proceed into the 2020 ccar exercise as we discussed last quarter the pacing of our preferred dividends has recently changed in light of our september issuance and the conversion of existing preferred stock to floating rates with quarterly payments we expect our preferred expense to alternate between 17 million and 33 million every quarter going forward assuming no issuances or change in libor slide 11 provides a summary of our current outlook in summary i would like to reiterate a few items our fourth quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we ve made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle our execution on the mb acquisition is on track to meet our targets on both expense and revenue synergies as always we remain intensely focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to outperform through various economic cycles with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for q a chris doll director of investor relations thanks tayfun before we start q a as a courtesy to others we ask you to limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions we will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning during the question and answer period please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator dkitria please open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you and your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler scott siefers piper sandler analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my question hey tayfun i just wanted to ask about the fourth quarter provision and give some detail on the items impacting it in addition to just the move to the national charter but you had it sounds like a couple of commercial credits and then the impact from the credit card portfolio as well just as you think about things sort of on a go forward basis how much of that proves transitory and how much if any is sort of a new run rate in other words if it was higher than expected this quarter due to some of those kind of revert back down or what s the best way to think about it tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer sure scott i will make a few comments and i ll turn it over to frank for the credit piece we believe that clearly these couple of credits that just happened in one quarter impacted the provision numbers which we believe to be transitionary if you look at our guidance for next year we are clearly expecting continued stability in benign credit performance away from sort of the accounting related changes in our credit metrics this truly was just one of these quarters where a few credit loans came up but frank do you want to comment on that frank r forrest executive vice president and chief risk officer tayfun i will and scott we ve talked about before the commercial business and we ve done this a long time is lumpy it s the nature of the business lumpy one quarter that makes a trend in either direction in the commercial business and it s something that you manage over an extended period of time these two credits are non related to each other they re both kind of core middle market companies the company has actually banked for a long period of time one is a retailer one is in the hospitality sector they re just they re going through a workout and they happen to hit at the same time but if you revert back to the year and if you look at our overall again results for the year we re actually very pleased with the asset quality for the year as we said before our criticized assets came within our expectations for the year our outlook for 2020 has really not changed other than maybe a 2 basis points 3 basis points increase just given the economy and overall our nonperforming assets for the quarter were centered on these two items the 50 million net flow at the end of the day when we think back to the work we ve done in the company intentionally over the last four years we ve repositioned this company to be strong through operating cycles so we re highly confident i m highly confident we ve done that these are middle market credits the increases we ve actually seen for the year in our problem credits have been tied to kind of the lower end middle market a lot of that s reflective of repositioning the rating system from mb some of it s in our systems as well those credits tend to be very well secured and historically have a loan loss rate and it s a very granular portfolio which is what we like to see when you think about the portfolios at least in my experience where we you should be concerned as you think about the economy when an economy slips it s commercial real estate it would be your large corporate book and it would be leveraged and when you think about our commercial real estate book we have the lowest concentration of commercial real estate loans than any of our peers and that portfolio has performed exceptionally well and we position it with companies today that are basically national and large regional developers that are essentially investment grade or near investment grade lot of liquidity our large corporate books performed exceptionally well our shared national credit book very low level of criticized assets and it s very diverse we manage the risk exposures there i think very prudently and when you think about leverage leverage in our case we ve been focused on reducing that for now for four years we ve reduced over 5 billion in leveraged loans in the last four years which is a 48 decrease but we feel very good about the remaining leverage that we have today we have specialized groups that lend to that sector according to the line of business and they re tied together with specialists that we have in risk and we manage it prudently we monitor it prudently so our overall thesis i suppose is that when you think about the portfolio and what fifth third has done over the last four years we ve completely repositioned this portfolio for success and we re highly confident that that work will project itself as we move forward in 2020 and beyond under any economic scenario scott siefers piper sandler analyst okay that s helpful i appreciate that and then separately tayfun i was curious on the gain that you got from the change in the tra agreement do you guys have the same flexibility to repurchase shares with that gain as you do under kind of a more traditional if you were to just sell shares and get an after tax gain in that way tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer not with the gain that we book we typically go to the fed with a specific request but clearly the first quarter 2019 gain on share sales we are able to buy back shares with that but obviously this gain that we booked in the fourth quarter goes into our overall capital ratios which gives us a better starting point for the 2020 ccar exercise scott siefers piper sandler analyst yeah okay perfect thank you chris doll director of investor relations dkitria are you there operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin jefferies analyst thanks good morning guys can i ask a question on the right side of the balance sheet you talked about loans growing 4 this year i m wondering if you could put the deposits into context in terms of the mix of deposits and what type of growth you re expecting on the deposit side overall thanks tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer i suspect that i ll turn it over to jamie with details as well we obviously have had a very good year both in consumer as well as commercial deposits in 2019 we expect that our stable growth in consumer accompanied by good growth in household will continue we do expect a stronger year in commercial deposit growth as well because we have a good amount of focus on the partnership in our treasury management group and our commercial deposit jamie anything you want add james c leonard executive vice president and treasurer ken this is jamie one of our goals this year is that we do match loan growth with deposit growth and so for us we would expect core deposits to be growing similarly to the loan side at 4 tayfun mentioned our focus is really improving the share of wallet that we get on the commercial side of the aisle because historically retail as you know has been a very strong provider of deposits and funding for the company over the years so our focus is getting commercial up to those levels so we would expect commercial to outperform those numbers and then on the retail side to be a little bit less than that 4 number in part because we are intentionally running down our cd portfolio and repricing a lot of those higher cost cds around 2 or so right now repricing them down in the 1 25 range so we are driving those deposits out the door which results in a little bit lower retail deposit growth number however you see that benefit show up in our deposit costs both in the fourth quarter as well as a big support to what we expect in the first in the second quarter of the year ken usdin jefferies analyst got it ok and maybe as a follow up on the first quarter outlook you talk about down 2 but you nii but you did indicate that you expect the core nim to be up and loan stable so can you help us flush out what the other deltas would be in terms of you mentioned the seasonality of securities and some of the deposits like what else it seems like that there wouldn t be so much of a drag on fourth to first james c leonard executive vice president and treasurer yeah from an nii dollars perspective the fourth to the first is really driven by day count of 10 million then higher wholesale funding costs and the impact of seasonal runoff in ddas that s about 5 million and then the investment portfolio we expect to be down about 10 million from the elevated fourth quarter levels the fourth quarter levels include a lot of the year end one time mutual fund dividend amounts and that was 6 million and so the other portion of the investment portfolio reduction is that we did not reinvest cash flows in the fourth quarter and as tayfun mentioned given where rates are right now we don t expect to reinvest all of our portfolio cash flows in the first quarter so we ll be opportunistic if things change we certainly have the capacity to reinvest but right now we re running the portfolio at about 21 of total assets and that s will probably be in that 21 to 22 range over the course of the year tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and maybe this is a good point for us also to add that for the year our nii guidance for the year basically assumes a fairly flat even maybe a slightly down average portfolio balance so for those of you who are modeling investment portfolio numbers for 2020 our decisions on the investment portfolio tend to be very opportunistic but for now as we sit here at the beginning of the year we re not anticipating an increase to investment portfolio balances if we do see opportunities if the environment changes that clearly will have an impact on the actual performance when we get to the end of the year ken usdin jefferies analyst okay thanks guys operator your next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari evercore isi analyst hey good morning on the cecl front if you could help us think about how provision on a day two basis could shape up in terms of either on a quarterly basis as we go into 2020 or how we could think about it on a full year basis on how it s impacted by the adoption thanks tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer sure yeah i think the progress in our reserves and the impact on the provision number is probably very similar to others except for when you look at what s driving the higher reserve rates it really is the longer dated loans and some of the consumer credit outstandings we as you know have been very clear on our expectations with respect to the residential mortgage portfolio we do not intend to grow that portfolio not necessarily because of cecl but just because in the current interest rate environment i don t think that we re getting paid to grow that and home equities have been declining that s another portfolio that has a relatively large increase in under cecl compared to the incurred methodology so those two portfolios should not contribute much in terms of increases in reserve coverage the one portfolio that we continue to grow is auto now auto cecl is also higher than auto incurred loss so that should have a slight sort of increase but if we continue to grow our commercial book as we have done so in the past that s our biggest book and we will continue to grow that i suspect that our coverage ratio ultimately will not change much from where we are standing but we re all going to have to wait and see how this plays out it is without having not even a quarter under our belt it is very difficult to establish good reliable trends given the impact of these various macroeconomic scenarios that we will be applying john pancari evercore isi analyst got it okay thanks tayfun and then separately on the mb side just wanted to see if you can give us an update on banker retention i know there was some concerns about that a few months back on some headlines that everything you had indicated that you re retaining a majority of your targeted employees as part of the deal you mentioned that last quarter just want to get an update on that front and where how that s been progressing greg d carmichael chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey john thanks for the question this is greg first of all we feel really good about the talent that we have in the chicago market as evidenced by the strong production numbers that we re seeing from chicago as you would expect we have a target of 255 million of expense reduction so a lot of that reduction shows up in the form of individuals to late expenses and so forth that did not have jobs offered to them so a lot of attrition you would expect to see that i would tell you in general 80 plus percent individuals we offer positions to or with the company remain we feel really good about that and our ability to hit our expense targets that we modeled in this attrition is exactly where we d expect it to be so we re there s no surprises here we ve also taken a best of breed approach so when you think about leadership in that market all right and as as ceo we ve retained the best of breed we thought to run that company there s redundancy there s optimization that s going to occur you would expect certain individuals to look for other opportunities as we modeled in so it s very much in line with what we expected there was no surprises here and we ll achieve the objectives we ve mentioned but more importantly the outcomes in chicago when you look at our retail franchise our wealth business and our strong strong core middle market production we re really excited about what we re seeing there and also the revenue synergies as they start to come together as we integrate that business into the rest of our business whether it be asset based lending leasing capital markets into the old mb book we feel really good about what we re seeing there and we re very bullish on the ability to accomplish our objectives that we set forth in that market but there is no surprises here john pancari evercore isi analyst got it thanks greg i appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst great thanks and just in terms of corporate banking obviously you ve had really good success over the last couple of years with that business and i know your fee growth is obviously higher for 2020 in general but can you just talk specifically about corporate banking in terms of what you re expecting from that line is that like how far forward can we continue to expect sort of those double digit gains i m just trying to understand what s sort of transitory versus more of a sustainable growth rate greg d carmichael chairman of the board president and chief executive officer ken i ll add to this and then i ll turn it over to lars for a little more color on this first off when you go back and think about our north star commitments a lot of those investments were in corporate banking capital markets area and those investments we said will start to materialize from a revenue perspective in 2019 you re seeing that strength in 2018 continued strength in 2019 we continue to invest in that area because once again it provides the products and services we need to better support our clients and we have a great team assembled and we continue to make great progress in that area so we would expect that performance to continue as we look into 2020 and beyond so lars let me give you that lars c anderson executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah ken we re really pleased with how the north star investments foundational have really played out we shared with you in particular the replatforming of our frm business we re already seeing the benefits of that you can actually see that in our foreign exchange performance this quarter frm business is really coming back it s strong but in addition to that a real focus on our advisory model our relationship banking model and aligning our businesses to both our middle market focus as a company as well as our industry verticals to be an advisor a consultant which that meant that we really needed to go after the investment banking piece of capital markets and that is paying big big dividends for us today so an example of that would be coker capital that we acquired and that perfectly aligns with our advisory approach to the healthcare industry most recently you saw the fact that we recruited 12 investment bankers in san francisco it aligns with our renewables and solar business so that s the theme here is to continue to build out a broad platform to serve the industries geographies and segments that we plan to win in now look we may not be able to control the ultimate loan growth quarter to quarter or year to year because there are macroeconomic impacts on that but one thing we can do is bring them advice solutions and those are often tied toward our fee products and services and you re seeing that come through in our corporate banking success i m really proud of the talent that we have ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst all right that s great and then just maybe one follow up question for tayfun you mentioned that you have higher regulatory expenses related to the charter change in 2020 as part of that 1 extra expense growth next year is there any seasonality related to that i m trying to figure out what s again what sort of unusual first half kind of driven expenses versus this just permanently increases your expense base thanks tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah there is no ken there is about 11 million 12 million just the direct fee that we pay to the occ it s just that s that marginal increase in indirect costs but there is no seasonality ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst and it s just an ongoing expense going forward tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct the change is a unique change year over year but it will be in our expense base going forward ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst perfect all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian bank of america analyst hi good morning i just wanted to reiterate maybe the point that you made earlier if the nii or the non interest income revenue outlook fell short there is room to pull the expense lever and potentially we do better than the 2 to 3 range to achieve positive operating leverage for 2020 tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we clearly we have always intended to in the past number of years to achieve it we achieved it every year and we continue to keep the same target and when you look at the contents of the remaining expenses beyond that 1 sort of unique change erika clearly our largest expense is in compensation and there is an underlying inflation built into that and that consumes over 0 5 point of that expense increase and in addition there is also another 0 5 point or so in expense increase related directly to revenue growth so if the revenues sort of tend to come in slower than we expect we believe that it will be reflected on expense growth as well and then we re going to have to make some choices as to where to invest and where not to invest to wait out a slower revenue growth environment erika najarian bank of america analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt o connor with deutsche bank matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning i was wondering if you could talk a bit about just commercial borrower sentiment you did mention that the payoffs were quite high in 4q and had a somewhat muted outlook for commercial lending i think it was the first quarter but it seems like maybe commercial and corporate sentiment is improving maybe it s just literally the last few weeks here but that s one of the themes that we ve been hearing from some other banks and maybe some of the things in the credit markets point to that as well so are you seeing some early signs of that or is it a little bit of a different customer base for you guys than maybe we re seeing elsewhere lars c anderson executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah matt so first of all just to address the first quarter there s seasonality issues in that so i would really be looking to tayfun s guidance for the year that s what we re focused on is executing in 2020 there has been a heightened sense of caution as we have moved through the second half of 2019 with some of the global tensions tariffs those kinds of things but some of the resolution of that we re beginning to hear some positive things we re seeing some activity levels that are reflected in the pipelines not just from a lending but also from a fee solutions perspective that is giving me a little bit more confidence as we look at 2020 and a potential pickup in activity levels there so frankly i m not looking at 2020 with a lot of concern i feel like that we can go out there and execute given where we have positioned our resources in the southeast in middle market banking in industry verticals but in summary there is still a sense of caution but i would describe it as positively migrating as you see a number of things start to play out in the global marketplace and with some of the trade tariff activities recently completed matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay that s helpful and then just separately you reiterated sort of your interest in additional fee deals you ve talked about this in the past just remind us kind of which areas you must be looking to complement and are they sizable enough that you kind of pull back a little bit of your capital versus your target or they re just not going to be meaningful enough to really impact the kind of capital and buyback story thank you tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the capital decisions are independent from that matt because they the timing of these availabilities are random we have in the past we re very clear lars mentioned the confidence that we have in our advisory businesses in commercial we clearly if we can if we come across opportunities to even grow our advisory m a services etc we will be looking for those long time ago we started talking about potentially adding more capital markets capabilities in commercial real estate as they may become available we will be focusing on those we have invested in our asset management business there are opportunities that are financially feasible and rewarding we will be looking at those so it is going to be more business commercial oriented fee oriented opportunities but at this point what we do with the capital that we have is somewhat independent of the opportunities if we see the opportunities we will execute them regardless of whether we re sitting on 0 5 billion of capital or not matt o connor deutsche bank analyst got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul martinez ubs analyst hey good morning guys first i wanted to clarify a couple of points on credit first you obviously on the commercial side you obviously mentioned the specific allowances for two commercial credits you also had a big increase in npl formation in commercial i think 165 million on page 21 i think frank you mentioned that was also related to the those two specific credits i just wanted to confirm that was the case and also on cecl tayfun just again a clarification and i have to sharpen my pencil on this but i think your allowance takes your acl ratio to like 160 bps 170 bps i guess what you re saying is that obviously there is volatility there s more things driving quarterly provision but your best guess at this point would be that it sort of stays in that range and we should be modeling provisions with charge offs and growth is that sort of the right way to think about it so a couple of questions with more a clarification question on tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll take the cecl one and then i ll turn it over to frank i think your numbers are right in the ballpark saul and yes sitting here looking at the balance sheet progress without necessarily having a clear cut knowledge of macro scenarios i can only assume that it s probably going to stay around those levels but obviously after a couple of quarters under our belt we will be able to give you a more precise answer on this one frank on the credit side frank r forrest executive vice president and chief risk officer yes on the 165 million your question was is it inclusive of the 50 million and the answer is yes it was and just as a reminder in the workout business things are lumpy it s you don t package things up in any package and you have even inflows and outflows we want to we analyze inflows every quarter in detail and look to see if there s any particular trends that are bothersome to us so we didn t see anything there in particular that s spread out i will say the flip side of that is we had a really strong quarter on collections so our net at the end of the day was 50 million which i think about as sort of those two credits that were there before so that s the story there and again it doesn t i don t think portend anything different in our outlook for 2020 we feel very good about 2020 based on where we sit today saul martinez ubs analyst great that s really helpful thanks a lot guys operator and your next question comes from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery christopher marinac janney montgomery scott analyst hey good morning i just wanted to follow up on tayfun s comment early in the call about the accelerated paydowns of leveraged loans in other commercial is that attrition going to continue do you think or would you look to replace those loans this year tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah our intent is not necessarily to grow the leveraged portfolio to make up for the faster payoffs we will make loan decisions independent of the payouts but lars any comments on that lars c anderson executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah no so actually going back to a previous question just so that you understand the build that you see and we have seen both in middle market and corporate banking increasing volumes of loan production throughout the year and that is really encouraging which i had mentioned about 2020 some of my optimism on the flip side and part of the muted impact in the ultimate balance sheet a softness in the industry that we re seeing has been in paydowns elevated paydowns however the complexion of that changed in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter rather than just deleveraging of some of our portfolio what we saw with the two biggest drivers was number one higher risk assets in the leveraged lending portfolio where we actually saw a decline there and that s a positive thing it s strengthening our balance sheet and it s not that we will not extend credit into the leveraged lending market but we re being very disciplined and selective in that market the second piece of it goes back to what frank said earlier we saw pretty significant paydowns in our construction lending line of business which i ve shared previously in prior calls that we expected that that would begin to occur this is a sign of a healthy commercial real estate portfolio late in the cycle so maybe a little bit more than you asked but to kind of frame it we do not see that leveraged lending will be a growth area for us for a period of time this late in the cycle christopher marinac janney montgomery scott analyst great lars that s really helpful background thank you both for the comments operator thank you your final question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler scott siefers piper sandler analyst hey guys thanks for taking the follow up i just wanted to ask on your greensky relationship i know you guys had renewed that relationship just at a top level any changes to how you re thinking about appetites for those types of credits and then i guess more specifically were there any changes in the terms as a result of that renewal tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer i can t necessary yes we renewed the relationship and we renewed the relationship having had the experience with greensky over the past couple of years and having seen a fairly stable credit performance having said that we believe that the renewal actually benefits us the way it was done the way it was structured from a credit support perspective as well as pricing perspective that s all i m going to comment given the fact that they re the counterparty to the agreement but we feel pretty good as to where we ended during the renewal discussion scott siefers piper sandler analyst all right that sounds great thank you tayfun tuzun executive vice president and chief financial officer okay chris doll director of investor relations well there is no

beijing jan 22 xinhua about five centuries ago portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan s daring global circumnavigation proved that the earth is round and the oceans are connected over the following centuries the power of industrial revolutions and technological breakthroughs has knitted almost all corners of the world together quickened the pace of globalization and ushered in an age of unprecedented level of prosperity in human history however the story of today s world is a far cry from a fairy tale that usually closes with a happily ever after ending as many world leaders and business elites are gathering in the swiss ski resort of davos for the annual meeting of the world economic forum wef globalization seems to be both losing steam and facing a fork in the road across the globe protectionists and isolationists are turning their countries ever inward looking putting up barriers and crippling global efforts to combat mankind s common challenges the wealth gulf has been yawning feeding the anger of populists in latin america and europe unilateralists are brandishing sanctions flexing military muscles and leaving a host of multilateral deals in tatters the connective power that used to break the spatial isolation among continents and oceans and pull different parts of the world together is now needed more than ever at this time of mounting uncertainties and expanding divisions to begin with the history of human progress has shown that free trade and open markets have been a proven formula to boost growth and generate wealth worldwide isolationism and protectionism as shown by the international monetary fund s repeated slashing of global growth forecasts are only counterproductive in his speech addressing the 2017 edition of the wef annual meeting chinese president xi jinping compared the global economy to a big ocean from which no one can escape any attempt to cut off the flow of capital technologies products industries and people between economies and channel the waters in the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks is simply not possible indeed it runs counter to the historical trend he said despite the strong headwind of protectionism free traders worldwide have in the past year made notable strides in promoting regional economic integration the african continental free trade area has been launched 15 participating countries of the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep have concluded text based negotiations and the european union and the southern common market mercosur have reached an agreement in principle on a free trade agreement those advancements have attested to xi s judgement three years ago secondly strengthening connective power by promoting practical cooperation worldwide can help bolster much needed economic development in the developing world so as to reduce global development deficits lack of infrastructure remains a critical bottleneck for developing countries to deliver steady economic growth take the african continent as an example according to an african development bank estimate africa s infrastructure needs are between 130 billion and 170 billion u s dollars per year but there is a financing gap in the range of 68 billion and 108 billion dollars china has been a vigorous champion of boosting connectivity by helping developing countries build up infrastructure through the belt and road initiative bri which is aimed at infrastructure development and acceleration of economic integration of countries along and beyond the routes of the historic silk road if implemented fully the initiative could lift 32 million people living on less than 3 2 u s dollars a day out of moderate poverty a recent world bank group study on the bri found last but not least the international community needs to leverage a stronger connective power to tackle such non traditional security challenges as climate change and terrorism that no single country no matter how powerful it might be can handle alone there is no second option in this regard when the ambitious magellan was on the sea he and his fellow sailors faced all sorts of hardships but they always managed to charge forward because they knew they were right in the direction today decisions makers around the world instead of being tempted to retreat to the past of isolation should remain in the same spirit as that of magellan and his seamen and harness the connective power to heal this dividing world and build a cohesive and more prosperous global community
tuesday s supreme court ruling declaring that debts owed in united states dollars us incurred on or before february 22 2019 should be settled using the zimdollar at a 1 1 parity will further deepen investor mistrust and complicate the prospects of economic revival analysts have said by everson mushava tuesday s supreme court ruling declaring that debts owed in united states dollars us incurred on or before february 22 2019 should be settled using the zimdollar at a 1 1 parity will further deepen investor mistrust and complicate the prospects of economic revival analysts have said the court upheld a government decree introduced in february last year through statutory instrument 33 2019 that converted debts accumulated in us to the local rtgs currency the ruling came after zambezi gas zimbabwe pvt ltd appealed against two judgments of the high court in june 2018 and may 2019 ordering the company to pay coal and chrome mining company nr barber pvt ltd over us 3 8 million in debts economist godfrey kanyenze said the ruling had thrown the country on the edge of an economic precipice exacerbated by worsening investor confidence thereby jeopardising the country s prospects of economic revival we have regularised the abnormal and now in terms of prospects of economic revival the year 2020 will be complex due to the deepening mistrust and lack of investor confidence in the government kanyenze said no investor will want to keep money in the country this is the second time assets have been transferred from the creditors to the borrowers kanyenze said the financial services and real estate sectors will be the worst hit the people in debt will celebrate creditors will mourn which destroys the basis of the sanctity of lending and borrowing this destroys the basis of the society store of value and medium of exchange he said kanyenze said government was the biggest beneficiary of si 33 19 which eroded salaries as well as consumer buying power another economic analyst john robertson said there was need for government to change its policies and attitudes if ever it was to entertain prospects of economic recovery he said chief justice luke malaba s ruling maintained the 1 1 parity but at the same time mentioned the issue of value which is at the core of the problems in zimbabwe the value of a zimbabwe dollar today is between one seventeenth and one twenty fifth of its value a year ago robertson said unfortunately government appears to be determined to pay back only a fraction of the amount they borrowed by selling treasury bills to our pension funds and banks even more unfortunately they borrowed billions of us dollars and they don t have and never did have billions of us dollars to settle the debts creating and then devaluing the rtgs dollars was government s only way out of debt because they now want to pay six us cents worth of zimbabwe money for every us dollar they borrowed once again our bank balances and pension fund savings have been almost wiped out to rescue the country we have to start now to behave in ways that persuade investors that we are deserving of their trust that will call for a complete change in government policies and attitudes uk based zimbabwean lawyer alex magaisa in his legal opinion released on tuesday described the ruling as a greatest heist by government saddled by an us 11 million domestic debt adding it was hard to make sense of the reasoning of the judges a reduction in an asset from us 3 8 million to us 144 000 is by all accounts a serious erosion and violation of one s private property rights he said adding the judges argument showed that there was erosion of private property rights the government has reduced its domestic debt by theft all those who are owed by the government must count their losses he said one thing for sure though is that this judgment brings to the fore the hazardous nature of the zimbabwean economic terrain for those engaged in trade and commerce just a simple decree can have devastating consequences lawyer tawanda nyambirai said the ruling was simply confirming what had been in place since february last year when si 33 was introduced the effect was that all balances except foreign debts would be converted to local currency nyambirai said all our balances that were in us were converted using the 1 1 exchange rate the effects we started feeling them last year the effects were devastating on employees zimbabwe dollar loosing value on fixed salaries pegged on us consumers were affected and so were retailers who benchmarked their prices to the parallel rate where consumer spending had been cut people were impoverished he added this is why i applied to the high court challenging si 33 because it constitutes compulsory acquisition or deprivation of property without compensation nyambirai filed an urgent chamber application in july last year challenging si 33 which now constitutes financial amendment no 7 the court however ruled that the application was not urgent and had to give the opposing part time to file heads of argument which they have now done and await a court date

president donald trump addressed an audience of the global business elite in davos on tuesday to make the case that ordinary americans have been the chief beneficiaries of his administration s america first maxim at the world economic forum in the swiss alps trump argued that a regime of tax cuts regulatory rollbacks and protectionist trade policies have benefited the working class every decision we make on taxes trade regulation energy immigration education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday americans trump said adding that the well being of the american worker was paramount on cnbc national economic council director larry kudlow echoed the president s assertions inequality is diminishing right now he said i think we re in a better place many mainstream economists hold a different opinion while low unemployment and steadily if slowly rising wages have improved the fortunes of lower income americans these gains pale in comparison to the investment gains realized by the wealthy few the economic backdrop is such that people s finances are improving and the stage is set for further improvement it s debatable what all of that s attributable to said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com in spite of higher incomes significant wealth building among the middle class has not manifested mcbride pointed out more people are working more people are making money the extent to which people have used that backdrop as way to step further towards financial security such as boosting emergency savings retirement savings or paying down debt is still unclear he said the republicans corporate tax cuts also magnified economic inequality said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics the tax policy center says that two thirds of the gains from the tax cuts in 2018 went to the top 20 percent of the household income distribution with the top one percent getting 21 percent of the immediate gains he said i don t particularly feel that it s been evenly distributed across the entire socioeconomic landscape said scott cole founder and president of cole financial planning and wealth management economists point out that trump s policies also have led to a ballooning of the federal deficit a growth sapping trade war and a recession in manufacturing even as the stock market has notched record highs there s no way that what s happening right now under a republican administration is fiscal conservatism cole said in his davos speech trump revisited another favorite topic negative interest rates they get paid to borrow money something i could get used to very quickly love that he said in reality negative rates would serve to further erode the financial stability of ordinary americans said karen shaw petrou managing partner of consulting firm federal financial analytics we know that they also destroy household savings and long term retirement security she said it s a move that supports stock markets not personal savings and to the extent that financial security is defined by wealth accrual a large number of households have still been left behind mcbride said we ve seen scant evidence that americans en masse have moved the needle regarding some fundamental aspects of financial security he said regardless of what the headline is i would think it s troublesome if you keep hearing about how great this economy is and you re not participating in it cole said

the supreme court judgment in the case of zambezi gas zimbabwe private limited v n r barber private limited and another sc3 20 represents a judicial confirmation of the grand heist that took place in february 2019 when the government issued a decree regarding the conversion of the us dollar to the rtgs dollar at the command rate of one to one guest column alex t magaisa the supreme court judgment in the case of zambezi gas zimbabwe private limited v n r barber private limited and another sc3 20 represents a judicial confirmation of the grand heist that took place in february 2019 when the government issued a decree regarding the conversion of the us dollar to the rtgs dollar at the command rate of one to one statutory instrument 33 of 2019 si 33 2019 was issued in terms of the presidential powers temporary measures act the controversial statute which permits the president to issue decrees its major purpose was to provide for the recognition of the rtgs dollar as legal tender although it was already in use it also provided for the command conversion of the us dollar denominated assets and liabilities at the fixed rate of one to one this is a fiction that the government had maintained since 2016 a windfall and a calamity the decree was a windfall for debtors whose debts were denominated in us dollars at the stroke of the presidential pen their debts had been significantly reduced in us dollar terms because contrary to the government s command rate the rtgs was weaker than the us dollar for the creditors however it was a total nightmare this is because of one of the provisions of si 33 2019 which provided that for accounting and other purposes all assets and liabilities which were valued and expressed in us dollars immediately before its effective date would be deemed to be values in rtgs dollars at a rate of one to one to the united states dollar so if the debtor owed us 1 million on february 21 2019 on february 23 2019 just two days later they owed just rtgs 1 million but in the real world rtgs 1 million was obviously significantly weaker than us 1 million all because the government said so via a draconian decree this is the essence of a command and control approach governance which is the hallmark of the zimbabwean regime while it was a boon for debtors it represented a devastating blow to creditors fighting over debts the ramifications of the government s decree were felt across the economic landscape and predictably the drama was soon being played out before judges in the courts of law this is because debtors suddenly found the energy to pay up their debts by simply converting their us dollar denominated debts to rtgs dollar debts at the rate of one to one effectively profiting at the expense of their creditors both creditors and debtors approached the courts for relief debtors insisting on their right to convert us dollar denominated debts at the rate of one to one and creditors protesting that this was improper and arguing that debtors should honour their contractual obligations in us dollars one of these cases reached the supreme court which delivered its judgment on january 20 2020 it is a heavy blow to anyone who was owed us dollar debts and obligations on february 22 2019 and confirms the windfall for debtors for the economy confirmation of the legality of the decree is a traumatic assault on business confidence as it erodes the right to private property and shatters the sanctity of contracts it makes a mockery of zimbabwe s claim of advances in ease of doing business let s take a quick look at the facts of the case the zambezi gas case the facts of the matter in the zambezi case are very simple in june 2018 n r barber pvt ltd barber won a lawsuit against zambezi gas zimbabwe pvt ltd for us 3 885 000 00 a debt which has arisen for services rendered there was an additional charge of interest and legal costs zambezi s appeal against the judgement was thrown out in may 2019 a week later zambezi deposited rtgs 4 136 806 54 as a settlement of the debt barber protested that the amount was far less than what zambezi gas had been ordered by the court it stated that the amount paid was only equivalent at the prevailing interbank market rate to us 144 788 23 out of the us 3 992 018 31 which it was expecting zambezi gas insisted that it had complied with the law after all it argued si 33 2019 allowed the conversion of all us dollar denominated local assets and liabilities at the government decreed rate of one to one barber instructed the sheriff of the high court to attach zambezi gas property to settle the difference that is when zambezi gas went to the high court pleading for a stay of execution and a declaration that the payment it had tendered in rtgs dollars was a full and final settlement of the judgement debt the high court dismissed zambezi gas s application zambezi gas then appealed to the supreme court it is this supreme court judgement that has sent shock waves in the markets in effect however the supreme court has merely confirmed the ill conceived and highly destructive step taken by the minister of finance mthuli ncube last february the consequences however are noxious the supreme court agreed with zambezi gas that si 33 2019 permitted it to convert the us dollar denominated judgment debt at the government decreed rate of one to one the chief justice luke malaba rejected the high court judge s reasoning that si 33 2019 did not include judgement debts in its ambit as long as the liabilities were expressed in us dollars the chief justice stated the provision applied interestingly because of si 33 2019 s express mention of us dollars the chief justice was prepared to concede that it would not have applied if the liability was expressed in another foreign currency other than the us dollar this suggests that liabilities expressed in south african rand or another currency would have been safer than liabilities expressed in us dollars this is an example of the absurdities that can result from a rigid and pedantic insistence on a literal interpretation of statutes which takes no account of context if the supreme court is right the discrimination between us dollar creditors and creditors owed in other foreign currencies is irrational and unfairly discriminatory itself a potential ground for unconstitutionality of the provision also if the supreme court is right it shows poor legislative drafting or at worst the inconsistency of government in policy making was it the intention of the government to affect only those who were owed us dollar balances if so what would be the basis for not affecting those who were owed debts in other foreign currencies toxic consequences the implications of this judgment could not be more devastating for the many who find themselves in the same situation as barber it is worse for creditors who were owed united states dollar balances and have not yet been paid because the exchange rate has tumbled greatly since february 2019 the zimbabwe dollar has on average been trading at one to sixteen on the interbank market and over 20 on the parallel market those poor creditors will be getting rtgs dollars that are far weaker than they were in february 2019 the problem of course lies with the government which issued this decree law and in particular the interpretation of statutes is not an exact science courts can only work with the laws that are on the statute books and bad laws tend to produce bad outcomes it is hard to see the justice of permitting debtors in zambezi gas position who having failed to pay their debts and having been sued for it suddenly find themselves on much higher ground than their creditors having enjoyed services worth us 3 9 million zambezi gas only had to pay 144 000 a mere pittance in the circumstances it s a huge loss to the creditor and a massive gain for the debtor the creditor says this violates the sanctity of contracts the debtor replies that it s vis major an act of god in reality it s a hare brained government decree that does significant harm to the economic environment erosion of private property clearly these figures represent a significant loss of property for the creditor and all others in its position however it is chief justice malaba s comments on the effect of conversion which are quite astounding barber s lawyers advanced a plea for consideration of parity arguing that the conversion of foreign currency denomination amounts to a lesser value in the local currency it s worth quoting the judge s full statement there can be no parity to talk about once it is accepted that the rtgs dollar is a currency denomination with a set legal value it is the legal tender in zimbabwe and as such carries a specific value once a conversion of the value of an asset or liability denominated in united states dollars is made to the value of rtgs dollars the converted value remains the same as the two different currency denominations both carry value no exchange rate can be applied as the judgment debt remains a judgment debt with a value after it is converted to the local currency the rtgs dollar has the value given under the one to one rate and it remains on that value even after the effective date it is hard to make sense of this reasoning when one considers what has happened to the rtgs dollar since si 33 2019 was issued in february 2019 how can it be said that the rtgs dollar has the value given under the one to one rate and it remains on that value even after the effective date when it is trading at around one to sixteen to the us dollar on the day that the judge was delivering his judgement is the ivory tower of justice so divorced from the economic realities so as to produce such esoteric comments from the country s leading justice perhaps the judge wanted to say something that his words did not express with sufficient coherence and clarity missing completely from this is the fact that the chief problem with si 33 2019 was the command rate of one to one which it imposed it was unrealistic then and it is even more absurd now this of course is the government doing but the chief justice had no business trying to justify the unjustifiable it s shocking that there was no dissenting opinion one thing for sure though is that this judgement brings to the fore the hazardous nature of the zimbabwean economic terrain for those engaged in trade and commerce just a simple decree can have devastating consequences for perspective there are many more in barber s situation who are now counting their losses in the wake of the supreme court judgment confirming the patently unjust effects of last year s decree they include commercial entities and individuals who were owed us dollar debts and obligations before 22 february 2019 now they must settle for payment in rtgs dollars converted at a rate of one to one when it fact the interbank and parallel market rates are nowhere near that to visualize the scale of the injustice consider a person who was owed us 100 in january 2019 she will now get rtgs 100 if she changed us 100 at the interbank market rate she would be getting rtgs 1600 that s a loss of rtgs 1500 the supreme court says it s what the law allows a reduction in an asset from us 3 9 million to us 144 000 is by all accounts a serious erosion of violation of one s private property rights there is one might imagine a good case for challenging the constitutionality of si 33 2019 and the subsequent finance act number two which replaced and confirmed it in august 2019 yet in view of the reasoning given by the chief justice such an application is unlikely to succeed the comments suggesting that there is no loss of value suggest a foreclosure of any arguments that there is erosion of private property right conclusion as the biggest domestic debtor the biggest beneficiary in all this is the government itself all its domestic debts which were denominated in us dollars cannot now be challenged now that the supreme court has spoken all those who are owed by the government must count their losses in effect si 33 2019 allowed the government to reduce its domestic debt by theft and the supreme court has just confirmed it yet in doing so the government has made itself a hard sell creditors will be very cautious and wary the next time it comes asking for credit lawyers operating in an authoritarian environment must find more ingenious ways of protecting the value of their clients property in any contractual arrangements those who have gained may find comfort in their windfall but any comfort that comes from authoritarian decrees is false and misleading comfort for the rest of the people whose losses have been confirmed it s yet another sobering lesson that salvation from authoritarian rule is not to be found in the courts of law instead it is in their hands

washington dc following america s disastrous 1930 smoot hawley tariff act the subsequent international trade war and eventually world war ii the united states went on to lead the world toward a more open multilateral trading system in 1947 the international community adopted the general agreement on tariffs and trade which would later become the world trade organization under this international body trade was bound to the rule of law and the principle of non discrimination among trading partners the system has been a huge success over the past seven decades world trade has grown almost twice as fast as real output and owing to us leadership there have been ongoing multilateral negotiations to lower tariffs remove other barriers such as quantitative import restrictions and facilitate trade expansion but in 2017 us president donald trump s new administration abandoned america s longstanding commitment to the open multilateral trading system opting instead for a power based approach to international economic relations under the new dispensation might supposedly makes right the result has been disastrous trade relations between the us and its major international partners are now fraught the global growth rates of both trade and gdp have fallen sharply and growth projections are being downgraded as further evidence of the economic damage caused by us trade policies comes to light one early step by the trump administration was to impose a 25 per cent tariff on imported steel and a 10 per cent tariff on aluminum this policy hurt canada the european union mexico and japan all us friends or allies but not china which accounted for only 2 per cent of us steel imports at the time it is estimated that the metal tariffs have cost americans 900 000 per year per job saved worse us employment in steelmaking has continued to decline and us steel exports have remained flat since the tariffs were introduced in early 2018 since then trump bullied canada and mexico into renegotiating the north american free trade agreement which has now been replaced by the us mexico canada agreement the revised deal tightens us regulations on imports of automobiles and auto parts and requires that 40 45 per cent of mexican auto workers be paid at least 16 per hour by 2023 for comparison that is tantamount to introducing a pay floor for us autoworkers of more than 75 per hour obviously an unthinkable proposition the trump administration has also forced a renegotiation of the south korea us free trade agreement with the main result being to restrict imports of steel from south korea and to prolong a us tariff on imported light trucks and then there is the trans pacific partnership which the obama administration negotiated with 11 other pacific rim countries excluding china and signed on february 4 2016 immediately upon taking office trump withdrew america from the tpp leaving the remaining signatories to salvage the deal which they have done under japanese leadership as a result us exports to those countries are now subject to much higher tariffs than is trade among the remaining 11 members then came trump s trade war against china which has both undercut global trade and brought the bilateral relationship to its lowest point since the aftermath of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre even with the phase one agreement that has just been signed the average us tariff on imports from china will be around 19 per cent up from 3 per cent before the trade war worse the us has gained little from the process yes the latest deal includes a chinese commitment to import more us agricultural and other products but to represent a gain those additional purchases would have to be great enough to compensate for the lost exports of 2018 2019 trump s trade wrath has affected other countries as well the us has imposed additional tariffs on imports from turkey brazil argentina and several developing countries including india which would otherwise be eligible for preferential tariff treatment under us law now us india relations are deteriorating the us has also deployed economic and secondary sanctions against a wide range of countries while some sanctions are obviously justified such as those against countries involved in terrorism the trump administration has expanded the use of this tool with abandon the us is now enforcing sanctions against more than 1 000 countries businesses and individuals per year moreover the us has even threatened tariffs on 2 4 billion worth of french imports in retaliation for france s plan to introduce a domestic tax on digital services and that comes on top of the 7 5 billion in annual levies that the us is permitted to impose on imports from the eu as part of the resolution to a dispute between airbus and boeing fears of a us eu trade war have created a cloud of uncertainty over auto producers and many other sectors around the world finally as if all of this were not damaging enough to the global trading system the us refuses to allow for new appointments to the wto s appellate body which has now been rendered powerless to resolve bilateral trade disputes in the absence of a functioning enforcement mechanism national governments have much less incentive to abide by their wto commitments ultimately america is the big loser the trump administration s efforts to reduce the us trade deficit have reduced imports from china but imports from countries like vietnam have risen sharply global investment and output meanwhile have fallen partly as a result of the trade uncertainty us exporters to the tpp successor countries now find themselves at a disadvantage and america itself is no longer trusted as a leader in the world trading system with geopolitical tensions growing the us needs allies now more than ever but many will be hesitant to engage with the current administration in the end trump s unilateral trade policy has achieved the opposite of its objectives many of which could have been met through multilateral cooperation anne o krueger a former world bank chief economist and former first deputy managing director of the international monetary fund is senior research

open this photo in gallery the headquarters of the european central bank is pictured in frankfurt germany on jan 23 2020 daniel roland afp getty images the european central bank launched a broad review of its policy on thursday that is likely to see new president christine lagarde redefine the ecb s main goal and how to achieve it the euro zone s central bank has fallen short of its inflation target of just under 2 per cent for years even after launching increasingly aggressive stimulus measures under ms lagarde s predecessor mario draghi ms lagarde said that aim will now be reviewed along with the ecb s tool kit how it measures price growth and how it communicates with the public we will not leave any stone unturned and how we measure inflation is clearly something we need to look at ms lagarde told her second news conference as ecb president how the ecb changes its formulation of price stability currently defined as an annual inflation rate below but close to 2 per cent over the medium term will be crucial to anticipate future policy moves the ecb could signal its commitment to boosting inflation by raising the goal to 2 per cent and spelling out that it will take any undershooting just as seriously as an overshoot but hawks on the policy making governing council who have long called for the ecb s money taps to be shut off will not go down without a fight some of them favour creating a tolerance band around 2 per cent which would reduce pressure on the ecb to act while others would leave the target unchanged or even cut it ms lagarde refrained from revealing her favoured option pending the end of the review expected in november or december an analysis on how to better incorporate housing costs which have been rising fast in germany and other euro zone countries is likely to take even longer ms lagarde added climate change the ecb will also look closely at how it can incorporate the economic impact of climate change into its policy this is a thorny issue that some of ms lagarde s colleagues do not believe belongs in a central bank s mandate at all objections include that a climate change objective might interfere with the ecb s goal of maintaining price stability or ease pressure on governments to do their part i m aware of all that but i m also aware of the danger of doing nothing and i think that you know failing to try is already failing ms lagarde said she added the ecb could look at whether the issuers of the bonds that it buys or accepts as collateral comply with environmental social and corporate governance criteria policy on hold ecb rate setters did not make any policy change on thursday simply standing by their pledge to keep buying bonds and if needed cut interest rates until price growth in the euro zone heads back to their goal they did however discuss the recent improvement in the economic outlook which has seen data stabilize and the united states and china reach a trade deal ms lagarde acknowledged that views differed on the governing council and welcomed the discussion emphasizing the diplomatic skills that her predecessor was often accused of lacking i m not a despotic president of the governing council ms lagarde said all governors have their space and time in order to share their perspective and submit their views but at the end of the day and at the end of the process we still have to complete the introductory statement and release a monetary policy decision the ecb is widely expected to leave its monetary policy on hold until the review is completed that would leave it adding 20 billion 29 billion worth of bonds to its 2 6 trillion portfolio every month and charging banks 0 5 per cent on their idle cash for most of the year but ms lagarde said the ecb would adhere to its current strategy until a new one is adopted meaning policy changes could still take place in the meantime we think the ecb will cut interest rates at the end of the year when the review concludes in order to underline its commitment to meeting the inflation target said paul diggle an economist at aberdeen standard investments the euro fell against the u s dollar after ms lagarde s news conference and was last down 0 4 per cent at us 1 1046

years have raised tax rates for upper income earners cross says in 2017 the latest year of comparable data the top 10 per cent of income earners earned about a third of total income but paid more than half of the country s total income taxes cross says that gap has always been there but it has grown wider over the past three decades between 1982 to 2017 the share of income earned by the top 10 rose 13 2 while their share of income taxes rose 22 4 and here s the kicker being in the top 10 of earners in canada doesn t mean you are wealthy in fact in 2017 any canadian making 96 000 or more was in

the japanese yen strengthened and china s yuan fell to a two week low on thursday as investors grew more anxious about the spread of a virus in china while the euro was calm ahead of the european central bank meeting elsewhere australia s dollar rose half a per cent after a surprise drop in the country s unemployment rate deaths from the flu like coronavirus stand at 17 almost 600 people are infected and china has locked down wuhan a city of 11 million people where the outbreak was believed to have originated at an animal market the moves up in the safe haven yen and down in the yuan were measured suggesting investors were not yet panicking about the virus the yen rallied 0 3 per cent to 109 57 after earlier reaching 109 50 yen per dollar its strongest since january 13 the dollar gained 0 3 per cent versus the offshore chinese yuan to 6 9351 yuan which has now lost more than 1 per cent of its value since its six month highs touched on monday hao zhou an economist at commerzbank said the worry was that the virus would hurt china s domestic demand to cope with this risk monetary policy could illustrate further easing bias for the fx market risk off mode is likely to dominate for the time being he said euro dollar trading at 1 1089 was little changed before the ecb meeting as was the dollar against a basket of currencies the ecb introduced a stimulus programme in september and data since then have suggested some improvement in the euro zone s economy so analysts doubt ecb boss christine lagarde will announce much on thursday investors will focus on her answers to questions about the ecb s strategic review which could see changes to its inflation target the ecb meeting will in our view have limited implications for eur usd the two key points in the bank s message should be in our view that data suggests a pick up in inflation and the manufacturing cycle has bottomed out ing analysts said in a research note the ecb rate decision is due at 1245 gmt its press conference starts at 1330 gmt the australian dollar gained 0 5 per cent to as high as 0 6879 after data showed unemployment declined to a nine month low sterling consolidated around 1 3040 after gaining wednesday on dwindling expectations the bank of england will cut interest rates next week the euro fell to a three year low against the swiss franc of 1 0737 before recovering to 1 073 the franc has been strengthening since the us treasury added switzerland to a watchlist of currency manipulators which led some to bet the swiss central bank will be more willing to let the franc appreciate the canadian dollar dropped again reaching a one month low of 1 317 against the us dollar after the bank of canada on wednesday signalled a future rate cut should a recent slowdown in domestic growth persist share copy link email facebook twitter telegram linkedin whatsapp reddit
editor s note while we don t often report on finance there is some overlap between big economic trends and how companies do their planning and regions as a whole must consider how major shifts in the market will affect them too with that please enjoy this 2020 market watch from a smart community member who thinks about this stuff for a living the following article originally appeared in stratfi s forward view market outlook 2020 email published on jan 18 it s january a perfect time to make forecasts like our new year s resolutions sometimes they happen sometimes they don t but hey they somehow make us feel better and it s almost always worth the effort first let s look back 2019 was full of economic surprises mostly delightful no market forecaster in their right mind would have predicted a 30 gain in the s p 500 last year it just wasn t in the cards but it happened and nobody is complaining the rapid growth of stock prices was triggered by two other surprises surprise 1 negative interest rates are officially a thing now roughly 15 trillion of global government bonds now have negative yields who would have imagined that japan has been flirting with 0 bond yields for decades now but for 10 year german bundesbank bonds to yield 0 3 it suggests some people so freaked at the prospect of losing money that they would gladly invest their hard earned euros at a guaranteed loss to avoid the possibility of an even greater loss this theory was simply never covered in my undergraduate economics classes at william mary who knew my head is still spinning surprise 2 now that it is possible to have negative interest rates the federal reserve decided that it made sense to avoid a mid 2020 recession signaled by the inverted yield curve prompted by political pressures the fed reduced its benchmark lending rate three times in a single year such heroic measures are typically deployed to avoid financial collapse in this case it happened within the context of a stable growing economy with 2 gdp growth and relatively full employment we ve simply never seen this type of preemptive stimulus before there are a few implications asset inflation is back low yields on bonds typically leads to higher prices on stocks low yields on bonds typically leads to higher prices on stocks wage inflation should be coming back and this is not necessarily a bad thing wages have lagged productivity growth for the past 30 years we need to do a better job of sharing the economic pie it starts with fair compensation and this is not necessarily a bad thing wages have lagged productivity growth for the past 30 years we need to do a better job of sharing the economic pie it starts with fair compensation malinvestment will happen easy money makes for bad decisions bad decisions make for good stories we saw the collapse of wework last year there may be more easy money makes for bad decisions bad decisions make for good stories we saw the collapse of last year there may be more government debt will continue to explode low interest rates for deficit spending is like giving candy to a diabetic everything here points to a greater toleration for inflationary risks so what about the markets as we ve all learned by now economists aren t particularly useful at forecasting the stock market so i prefer to use a different set of tools here s a chart for what s going on with the s p 500 index keep in mind that everything is subject to change top chart we ve had steady rising trend line green for the s p 500 since october moving averages red and blue are both positive there is a possibility of a slight pullback to the lower end of the trading range possibly 3230 3 by february march not a big deal conclusion the trend is our friend here don t fight it middle chart recent gains are supported by healthy trading volume we had a few low volume days over the holiday season but this is normal conclusion new money is still going into the market it can continue until everyone is fully invested and we all have the most to lose bottom chart markets are officially in overbought range and have been since mid december conclusion this is what a raging bull market looks like enjoy it while it lasts in all seriousness this is a fairly supportive market for investments the last two decades have generated below historically average returns for most investors so it s nice to have a break from that and feel like it is the 1980s 1990s again depending on what valuation metrics are used the market can be shown to be over or under priced this is a very uncertain political landscape so everything can change in less time than it takes to post a coherent blurb on twitter my sense is that interest rates tax cuts and temporary relief from trade worries can support market growth which could continue for the first half of this year in the second half of the year we may see some softness without additional economic stimulus 2021 could be a tougher environment at the moment i m most interested in foreign emerging markets technology stocks sounds a little crazy i know in the greater philadelphia area at this end of this month i ll put on my futurist cap and give a workshop on mega

frankfurt the european central bank has decided to launch a top to bottom review of how it steers the economy in the 19 countries that use the euro currency the review the first since the global financial crisis could include tweaking the bank s goal for inflation and finding ways to help fight climate change the bank s 25 member governing council on thursday gave the green light for the proposal from new ecb head christine lagarde which follows a similar review underway at the u s federal reserve recommended videos one main focus will be the ecb s inflation target of close to but below 2 annually under lagarde s predecessor mario draghi the ecb struggled to reach the target despite despite massive stimulus measures it lowered interest benchmarks below zero and pumped 2 6 trillion euros 2 9 trillion into the financial system through bond purchases a moderate level of inflation is considered to offer a margin of safety against deflation a vicious circle of falling prices investment and slow growth some inflation also helps indebted countries in the eurozone improve their price competitiveness compared with near trade partners the central bank s current goal could be replaced by a range or a different formulation lagarde s move comes as central banks in advanced economies are struggling to accelerate growth and inflation inflation growth and interest rates have been persistently low in europe the united states and japan for a decade even as central banks have slashed rates to very low or even negative levels and purchased billions of dollars of financial assets fed chair jerome powell has called it the new normal and launched his own policy review last year economists say that several trends are behind the trend aging populations and slower population growth hold back the economy while globalization and online shopping have forced companies to keep prices low limiting inflation and worldwide demand for safe investments particularly government bonds have held down interest rates some central bankers worry they will have less room to cut rates the next time a recession hits in the u s the fed typically cuts its benchmark short term rate by 5 percentage points during a downturn but that rate is currently in a range of just 1 5 to 1 75 leaving it with much less room to cut the european central bank and bank of japan already have slashed their interest rates below zero both the fed and ecb appear to be focusing on how they might change their inflation targets to make them more credible the fed seeks inflation of 2 if businesses and households become more confident that central banks can hit their targets they will change their behavior in ways that will help for example if workers expect prices to rise 2 they will demand raises at that level or higher which in turn can force businesses to increase prices to offset the cost that then pushes inflation closer to 2 another topic of the ecb s review will be whether the bank can adjust its policies to help the fight against climate change one way central banks could influence climate policy would be to make bonds funding environmentally friendly projects such as wind farms part of its bond buying stimulus program lagarde said it was difficult to disagree that climate change could threaten financial stability but did not go into detail about how or even whether the ecb could act on environmental matters the ecb does not currently buy bonds on environmental criteria but has in fact bought bonds that finance environmentally friendly projects as part of its broader stimulus effort to raise inflation the bank s primary mandate is price stability under the european union treaty only after that can it pursue other goals of eu economic policy such as jobs growth and the environment the central bank on thursday left unchanged its key interest rates and stimulus programs lagarde said in her news conference that risks to the economy have become less pronounced as some of the uncertainties around international trade have receded a day earlier u s president donald trump and european commission president ursula von der leyen said they expect a u s eu trade deal this year the u s has also signed an initial trade pact with china that eases some tensions lagarde took over from mario draghi on nov 1 at the head of the top monetary authority for the 19 countries that use the euro as their currency she inherited a stimulus package enacted at draghi s next to last meeting in september the bank cut the deposit rate on money left overnight by commercial banks to minus 0 5 from minus 0 4 and started 20 billion euros 22 billion in monthly bond purchases the package was aimed at supporting weak growth against headwinds from trade disputes ___ chris rugaber in washington contributed to this report

washington dc following america s disastrous 1930 smoot hawley tariff act the subsequent international trade war and eventually world war ii the united states went on to lead the world toward a more open multilateral trading system in 1947 the international community adopted the general agreement on tariffs and trade which would later become the world trade organization under this international body trade was bound to the rule of law and the principle of non discrimination among trading partners the system has been a huge success over the past seven decades world trade has grown almost twice as fast as real output and owing to us leadership there have been ongoing multilateral negotiations to lower tariffs remove other barriers such as quantitative import restrictions and facilitate trade expansion but in 2017 us president donald trump s new administration abandoned america s longstanding commitment to the open multilateral trading system opting instead for a power based approach to international economic relations under the new dispensation might supposedly makes right the result has been disastrous trade relations between the us and its major international partners are now fraught the global growth rates of both trade and gdp have fallen sharply and growth projections are being downgraded as further evidence of the economic damage caused by us trade policies comes to light one early step by the trump administration was to impose a 25 per cent tariff on imported steel and a 10 per cent tariff on aluminum this policy hurt canada the european union mexico and japan all us friends or allies but not china which accounted for only 2 per cent of us steel imports at the time it is estimated that the metal tariffs have cost americans 900 000 per year per job saved worse us employment in steelmaking has continued to decline and us steel exports have remained flat since the tariffs were introduced in early 2018 since then trump bullied canada and mexico into renegotiating the north american free trade agreement which has now been replaced by the us mexico canada agreement the revised deal tightens us regulations on imports of automobiles and auto parts and requires that 40 45 per cent of mexican auto workers be paid at least 16 per hour by 2023 for comparison that is tantamount to introducing a pay floor for us autoworkers of more than 75 per hour obviously an unthinkable proposition the trump administration has also forced a renegotiation of the south korea us free trade agreement with the main result being to restrict imports of steel from south korea and to prolong a us tariff on imported light trucks and then there is the trans pacific partnership which the obama administration negotiated with 11 other pacific rim countries excluding china and signed on february 4 2016 immediately upon taking office trump withdrew america from the tpp leaving the remaining signatories to salvage the deal which they have done under japanese leadership as a result us exports to those countries are now subject to much higher tariffs than is trade among the remaining 11 members then came trump s trade war against china which has both undercut global trade and brought the bilateral relationship to its lowest point since the aftermath of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre even with the phase one agreement that has just been signed the average us tariff on imports from china will be around 19 per cent up from 3 per cent before the trade war worse the us has gained little from the process yes the latest deal includes a chinese commitment to import more us agricultural and other products but to represent a gain those additional purchases would have to be great enough to compensate for the lost exports of 2018 2019 trump s trade wrath has affected other countries as well the us has imposed additional tariffs on imports from turkey brazil argentina and several developing countries including india which would otherwise be eligible for preferential tariff treatment under us law now us india relations are deteriorating the us has also deployed economic and secondary sanctions against a wide range of countries while some sanctions are obviously justified such as those against countries involved in terrorism the trump administration has expanded the use of this tool with abandon the us is now enforcing sanctions against more than 1 000 countries businesses and individuals per year moreover the us has even threatened tariffs on 2 4 billion worth of french imports in retaliation for france s plan to introduce a domestic tax on digital services and that comes on top of the 7 5 billion in annual levies that the us is permitted to impose on imports from the eu as part of the resolution to a dispute between airbus and boeing fears of a us eu trade war have created a cloud of uncertainty over auto producers and many other sectors around the world finally as if all of this were not damaging enough to the global trading system the us refuses to allow for new appointments to the wto s appellate body which has now been rendered powerless to resolve bilateral trade disputes in the absence of a functioning enforcement mechanism national governments have much less incentive to abide by their wto commitments ultimately america is the big loser the trump administration s efforts to reduce the us trade deficit have reduced imports from china but imports from countries like vietnam have risen sharply global investment and output meanwhile have fallen partly as a result of the trade uncertainty us exporters to the tpp successor countries now find themselves at a disadvantage and america itself is no longer trusted as a leader in the world trading system with geopolitical tensions growing the us needs allies now more than ever but many will be hesitant to engage with the current administration in the end trump s unilateral trade policy has achieved the opposite of its objectives many of which could have been met through multilateral cooperation anne o krueger a former world bank chief economist and former first deputy managing director of the international monetary fund is senior research

in a january 14 article for vox ian millhiser discusses a new proposal in the harvard law review designed to accomplish four things 1 a transfer of the senate s power to a body that represents citizens equally 2 an expansion of the house so that all citizens are represented in equal sized districts 3 a replacement of the electoral college with a popular vote and 4 a modification of the constitution s amendment process that would ensure future amendments are ratified by states representing most americans the scheme consists of dividing up the district of columbia into more than one hundred new tiny states so as to drastically increase the number of leftist controlled states so as to push through a wide variety of new constitutional amendments milhiser is enthusiastic since he believes the us electoral system is too undemocractic and that the system must be overhauled so that the united states has an election system where every vote counts equally milhiser s concept of unequal is illustrated more clearly when he calls the us senate ridiculous because it is a system where the nearly 40 million people in california have no more senate representation than the 578 759 people in wyoming so now we have arrived at the heart of the matter milhiser contends californians are underrepresented in washington or more likely he thinks leftists are underrepresented given the context of the piece because wyoming and california have equal representation in congress this we are supposed to believe somehow leaves millions of californians disenfranchised common sense however strongly suggests californians or at least the politicians who claim to represent them are quite well represented in washington and wield quite a bit of power let s look at some numbers california has fifty three votes in the us house of representatives while wyoming has one image as a percentage of the full house california s delegation makes up 12 percent of all votes while wyoming s makes up 0 2 percent image in fact california s representation in the house is so large that california house members outnumber members from an entire region of the us namely the rocky mountain region if we add up all eight states of the mountain west nevada utah arizona montana idaho wyoming colorado and new mexico we come up with only thirty one votes moreover many of these states have split delegations as with arizona and colorado and rarely vote as a unified group california on the other hand has only seven republican house members out of fifty three meaning that the state s delegation tends to reliably vote together california even enjoys a sizable advantage in the electoral college as well it is true that the electoral college formula evens things up somewhat california representatives wield more than 10 percent of all electoral college votes and wyoming enjoys only 0 6 percent of all votes now if the rocky mountain region were to vote together for a certain candidate it could theoretically almost equal the power of california but the region doesn t vote together with colorado new mexico and nevada often going for one party while the rest of the region goes for another thus california because its electoral votes are centralized brings more power to presidential elections than the entire rocky mountain region image so while it s true that wyoming s two votes in the us senate make it easier for a wyoming led coalition to veto legislation that favors california the same can be said of california in the house while california and wyoming theoretically have equal power in the senate wyoming has essentially no power in the house and could not possibly hope to do much to overcome opposition from california house members the fact that voters in wyoming have more us senators per person hardly places people with california type interests at the mercy of people with wyoming type interests essentially the system as it now functions places significantly more veto power in the hands of california in the house at best though wyoming has only an equal veto to california in the senate veto power of course is one of the most important aspects of us legislative institutions since it is designed to help minority groups protect their own rights even when lacking a majority this is the philosophy behind the senate s filibuster and the philosophy behind the bicameral legislature the purpose is to provide numerous opportunities for minorities to veto legislation pushed by more powerful groups the importance of protecting minority rights of course is a mainstay of the ideology we used to call liberalism the idea that people ought to enjoy basic human rights even when the majority doesn t like it all that is out the window however where progressives and other leftists suspect they are in the majority in which case the protection of minority groups is null and void suddenly the democratic majority is the only thing that matters had rank majoritarianism won the day in the past indian tribes catholics quakers and japanese americans would have all been extirpated or run out of the country a century ago but the sort of prudence that put some limits on the power of the majority in the is now thoroughly unfashionable on the left the left now strains to grasp the opportunity to rid themselves forever of even what small amount of legislative resistance can be offered by the hayseeds in flyover country the fact that california gets more than fifty times the votes of north dakotans isn t enough for progressives they must also stamp out what limited influence north dakota has in the senate as well this sort of thinking suggests that in order to make the us more democratic large minorities of voters voters with specific economic and cultural interests that differ from those in other regions ought to be rendered essentially powerless all that said i endorse the plan from the harvard law review milhiser is pushing it undermines the idea that the us s current state boundaries are somehow sacrosanct and that enormous states with millions of people are a perfectly fine thing the us and its member states are far too large and could use a thorough dismembering but milhiser should be careful what he wishes for
go left young marco photo tom williams cq roll call inc via getty images in the spring of 2008 barack obama announced his bid to become the next ronald reagan during an interview with the reno gazette journal the democratic candidate predicted that his election would change america s economic policy paradigm as thoroughly as the gipper s victory had three decades earlier i think part of what s different are the times obama said i do think that for example the 1980 election was different i think ronald reagan changed the trajectory of america in a way that you know richard nixon did not and in a way that bill clinton did not he put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it i think we are in one of those times right now the candidate continued where people feel like things as they are going aren t working that we re bogged down in the same arguments that we ve been having and they re not useful and the republican approach i think has played itself out you look at the economic policies that are being debated among the presidential candidates it s all tax cuts well we ve done that we ve tried it so some of it s the times it took eight months for obama s words to attain the aura of prophecy by the day of his inauguration reagan era orthodoxies had apparently driven the global financial system and conservative movement to the brink of collapse even america s high priests of supply side gospel had fallen into crises of faith alan greenspan told congress that the crash had exposed a flaw in his worldview so profound its exposure had left him in a state of shocked disbelief within weeks greenspan and republican senator lindsey graham were imploring the white house to consider a temporary nationalization of the american banking system the political press was replete with variations on obama s months old remarks a new liberal order was arising from the ashes of the bush presidency the emerging democratic majority had finally arrived on the cover of time magazine obama s photoshopped face smiled through fdr s signature accessories as a headline heralded the coming of a new new deal photo arthur hochstein lon tweeten time and then the times changed once the obama administration got the big banks off life support and mitch mcconnell s minority got its bearings the dream of a rapid realignment quickly died conservatives had little trouble recasting 2008 s apparent humiliation of market fundamentalism as an indictment of big government largesse lawless banks hadn t crashed the global economy by defrauding their customers bleeding heart liberals had done so by forcing banks to subsidize the parasitism of the spendthrift poor thus far from inducing a leftward lurch in republican economic thinking obama s election coincided with a reactionary resurgence by 2011 republicans weren t seeking accomodation with the president s ascendent creed he was seeking accomodation with theirs two years into the new new deal with unemployment still near double digits the democratic president was struggling to persuade republicans to help him cut social security six years after that donald trump presided over yet another round of supply side tax cuts even as the political basis for a leftward realignment on economic policy crumbled the empirical basis for such a development only grew stronger conservatives predicted that obama s stimulus spending would trigger runaway inflation instead consumer prices remained stubbornly low the center right insisted that fiscal austerity could supercharge growth europe implemented its prescription and plunged itself into a deeper hole meanwhile as the recovery delivered soaring asset prices to owners of capital but only tepid wage gains to ordinary workers america s inequality problem became too conspicuous for even conservative minded economists to ignore and all the while the steadily deepening climate crisis was transforming the notion that america needed a new green industrial policy from an article of far left faith into a pillar of scientific consensus now 12 years after the financial crisis and three years into donald trump s post truth presidency there are mounting signs that these empirical realities are finally making a dent in political ones that obama s prophesied realignment may be making its belated arrival some republicans are getting in touch with their inner eisenhower in the summer of 2012 mitt romney told african americans that if they wanted free stuff from the government they should vote for someone else months later the gop nominee derided 47 percent of the u s public as incurable layabouts whose sense of personal responsibility and care for their lives had eroded so completely the republican party no longer had anything to offer them seven years later romney signed onto a bill that would hike inheritance taxes on millionaires and billionaires and use the revenue to provide unconditional cash assistance to all low income parents regardless of their employment status the romney bennet refundable child tax credit would be the first in american history to provide financial relief to the very poorest families in the u s in lending his name to the policy romney adopted a position on child welfare to the left of many congressional democrats romney s change of heart on the propriety of cajoling indigent parents into the labor force by condemning their children to poverty is idiosyncratic in washington no other republican has signed onto his bill but it is nevertheless indicative of a broader leftward current in gop economic policy thinking earlier this month gop state legislators in kansas agreed to expand its medicaid program without work requirements as long as the state also increased subsidies for those purchasing private insurance meanwhile in d c house republicans began work on a conservative alternative to the green new deal according to axios the emerging legislation would double federal investment in basic research and fundamental science establish special lower tax rates for u s companies exporting clean energy technology expand tax credits for firms that sequester co2 redirect foreign aid to help countries that have rivers most polluted with plastic and provide unspecified incentives and funding to spur the planting of 1 trillion trees as a response to the climate crisis this is comically inept but as a house republican policy priority it is bizarrely constructive the gop leadership has tacitly affirmed the need for the u s government to increase its investments in scientific research and pursue a green industrial policy which is to say catalyze growth in the clean energy and carbon sequestration sectors through targeted interventions in the market economy the kind of industrial policy they propose is deeply inadequate to the scale of the ecological problem but the legislation s ostensible goals encouraging the rapid development and export of clean energy technologies in order to reduce the carbon intensity of economic growth in the developing world are vital ones and broadly similar to those in elizabeth warren s green industrial policy reactionary billionaires remain the gop s biggest stockholders but they no longer have a monopoly on the party s voting shares viewed in isolation each of these developments could be dismissed as a meaningless gesture after all stray messaging bills aside the trump era gop s economic policies have been historically reactionary the party very nearly threw millions of americans off of public health insurance slashed taxes on the wealthy and left corporate foxes guarding each of the regulatory state s hen houses on low visibility matters of executive branch policy the trump administration has been almost comically regressive fighting to expand the liberty of coal companies to dump mining waste in streams let financial advisers gamble with retirees money and free employers from the burden of logging workplace injuries among many other things meanwhile on the similarly low salience subject of federal judicial appointments trump has been stacking the courts with plutocracy superfans the gop is not becoming any less interested in taking from the poor or working class or environment or future generations to give to its top shareholders the party s influence peddling remains unconstrained by egalitarian inhibitions but its economic policy making is becoming a bit less constrained by ayn randian scruples romney is alone in supporting refundable child tax credits for the nonworking poor but a broader swath of the gop is warming to small bore family based social welfare policies including refundable child tax credits for working parents and modest forms of paid family leave kevin mccarthy s climate bill may be a mere stunt but the house minority leader is not alone in signaling a heretical interest in nonmilitary industrial policy republican senators josh hawley and marco rubio have made similar noises in recent months with the florida senator issuing a report on the harms of neoliberal financialization that actually cited the work of socialist economists in other words while republicans remain happy to do the bidding of libertarian billionaires when it suits their political interests they appear more willing to opportunistically flout the koch network s preferences than they were during the obama years this fact may reflect the changing class composition of the gop coalition as affluent suburbs defect to blue america or the increasingly conspicuous tension between cultural conservatism and market fundamentalism or the trauma of the failed obamacare repeal effort and ensuing midterm blood bath or it may simply reflect the fact that a republican is currently in the oval office the right has always looked more kindly on deficit spending and social welfare provisions when its people are at the wheel the times they are uh changing but even if the gop s flirtations with a post reaganite economic paradigm prove limited and conditional they could nevertheless be of real consequence for one thing romney and rubio s leftward drift helps fortify the democratic party s more robust one what passes for centrism in the 2020 democratic primary would have been coded as progressivism in 2016 2008 or any other cycle in my lifetime today joe biden s climate plan is more comprehensive than bernie sanders s was four years according to the left wing think tank data for progress michael bennet whose anemic campaign is sustained by its sheer incredulity at the left s imprudence is nevertheless running on a 6 trillion expansion of the social safety net financed by progressive tax increases given the biases of the senate the significance of the democratic field s leftward lurch largely hinges on whether the party s most conservative senators start bending in the same direction and when mitt romney makes unconditional assistance to poor families a bipartisan concept or house republicans tacitly affirm the need for uncle sam to pick winners and losers in the energy market it becomes a bit easier for joe manchin and kyrsten sinema to swim with the progressive tide similarly if even two or three republican senators retain their heterodox hobbyhorses when a democratic president takes power our government will regain the capacity to meaningfully legislate in times of divided rule the fundamental obstacle to federal progress on climate or poverty or health care reform over the past decade has not been the gop s stubborn insistence on inadequate solutions but rather its fanatical commitment to making our problems worse there can be no bipartisan compromise on climate if the republican position is that the government should do everything in its power to maximize carbon emissions from subsidizing failing coal plants to rolling back fuel efficiency standards in defiance of the auto industry s preferences and there can be no consensus approach to reducing poverty if the gop s prescription is to coerce the unemployed into the labor force by denying their families access to health care and housing by contrast if the partisan divide on climate and poverty is merely over exactly how much to subsidize green technology increase foreign aid to climate vulnerable countries ramp up federal spending on basic research and expand cash support to the neediest then it should be possible for congress to mount a productive legislative response to america s most pressing challenges to be sure the ifs in that last paragraph are big although the parties may be growing marginally less polarized on some economic issues the cultural antagonism between red and blue america has rarely been fiercer the notion that the democratic party and thus any elections it wins are fundamentally illegitimate appears more widespread in conservative circles than ever before just because marco rubio s staffers have read some iconoclastic economists doesn t mean that the gop s fever is about to break yet when one puts the gop s recent post reaganite gestures next to the left turn in mainstream economic thought the davos set s growing interest in shoring up the legitimacy of the order they sit atop with palliative policies on climate and inequality the british tories recent triangulation on economics in response to its own influx of non college educated voters and the resurgent hegemony of tax and spend liberalism within the democratic party s tent it s hard not to entertain the possibility that these times are different and that the 2020 election just might put america on a fundamentally different path
triangular cooperation aims to forge global partnerships and foster sustainable global development in such a system traditional donors provide financial and technical support to facilitate development activities between two developing countries in the south i e one emerging donor country and a beneficiary triangular cooperation allows nations to learn from the mistakes of the pioneers of the development cooperation process bringing about cost effective and efficient development assistance in the recipient countries this brief examines india s growth as a partner in development cooperation and in particular its commitment to triangular cooperation programmes the brief highlights the distinctions and similarities between india uk india us and india japan partnerships in terms of track one diplomacy scale of operations diversity and swiftness introduction with a long legacy of development assistance india has had a remarkable journey from being an aid receiver to an emerging donor despite the country s own development challenges india has embraced its global commitments and engages in development cooperation with other developing countries unlike the oecd s official development assistance oda the development assistance that india provides is wilful i e development cooperation for mutual benefit and not foreign aid india believes that when the countries are involved in any kind of cooperation be it through bilateral or multilateral channels the gains should be spread uniformly by leveraging the comparative advantages of the countries in question in the initial stages of the conception of triangular cooperation india was hesitant to engage actively due to its policy of anti colonialism and non alignment it did not want to partner with the ex colonial powers who were seen as exploiting the african continent for the newly decolonised countries india championed the cause of industrialisation and responded to their demands in the underlying sectors e g trade investment technology and capacity building in the 2000s india africa trade relations started an upward trajectory the african continent has substantial potential to develop and india has been considered as a promising emerging power according to ambassador retd h h s viswanathan distinguished fellow at observer research foundation in order to avoid duplication of effort there was a need for the western countries to partner with india and africa and hence a triangular cooperation with many countries working in africa was developed in 2003 the india development initiative idi located within the ministry of finance was established to improve the development assistance framework and in 2004 the indian development and economic assistance scheme ideas was set up to facilitate lines of credit loc through exim bank in 2006 and 2007 india co founded the global network of exim banks and development finance institutions g nexid and promoted the creation of the development cooperation fund dcf under the united nations economic and social council ecosoc unlike the organisation for economic co operation and development development assistance committee oecd dac the dcf is a grouping of recipients and donors based on mutually agreed principles and demand driven priorities in 2012 the development partnership administration dpa was created as a separate agency within the ministry of external affairs the data for net aid provided by india inr crore is used to investigate patterns in india s development assistance this dataset essentially means net aid provided by india aid provided by india aid received by india this india specific dataset is extracted from the ministry of external affairs website 2007 08 to 2015 16 the trend is captured using a line graph in figure 1 the rising trend line shows india s active involvement in providing development assistance to partner countries overcoming its traditional role from an aid recipient to an aid donor india began engaging in triangular and trilateral cooperation programmes to create a global footprint as an emerging donor trilateral cooperation was prevalent much before triangular cooperation northern donors such as usaid and jica have been actively promoting triangular cooperation since the early 2000s because of its many underlying advantages traditional donors such as the us and the uk are training emerging donors to take their place in the future which will allow the former to step back and reduce their burden of traditional donorship this has led to a cost effective development cooperation for the northern donors by way of resource pooling and hiring consultants from emerging countries the renewed importance attached to triangular cooperation is further reflected in key development policy documents such as the 2010 bogotá statement and the 2010 un secretary general s report on development cooperation the following are the key takeaways from the 2010 bogotá statement the south south cooperation is not a substitute but a complement to the north south cooperation with triangular cooperation acting as a bridge between south south and north south cooperation the synergies between the partner country emerging donor and traditional donor can be improved through triangular cooperation by reducing transaction costs and engaging in modalities that combine capacities know how and resources from the north and the south in order for triangular cooperation to be effective it is important that each actor contributes according to their respective comparative advantages and shares responsibility for demand based development results the 2010 un secretary general s report states that the key to achieving the development cooperation goals is to focus on the least developed countries ldcs the un conference on south south cooperation known as bapa 40 conference encouraged the participating countries to enhance their involvement in triangular development cooperation the conference addressed the key argument that the scope of triangular cooperation is getting broader with an increase in the number of actors involved the bapa outcome document notes there has been an expansion of the number of relevant actors in development including multiple stakeholders sub national entities and parliamentarians civil society private sector volunteer groups faith based organizations philanthropic organizations scientific and technological communities foundations and think tanks and academia as appropriate to understand the main agenda it is important to highlight the difference between triangular cooperation and trilateral cooperation while the two terms triangular and trilateral are often used interchangeably there is a crucial difference triangular cooperation involves southern driven partnerships between two or more developing countries supported by a developed country or countries or multilateral organisation s to implement development cooperation programmes and projects in many instances southern providers of development cooperation require the financial and technical support and expertise of multilateral and or developed country partners in the course of assisting other developing countries trilateral cooperation is a development relationship in which a development assistance committee dac donor and or multilateral agency e g japan germany the undp partners with a pivotal country e g brazil thailand south africa to work with a third partner recipient country e g ghana laos mozambique thus trilateral cooperation adds a third way to deal with the two predominant structures north south aid and south south aid and is progressively equivalent in nature on the other hand triangular cooperation takes the south south cooperation forward and works on the principle of power dynamics civil society organisations and non governmental actors are often associated with triangular cooperation whereas the trilateral cooperation is simply government to government i e the governance structures of the nations are accorded prime importance the india us india uk and india japan associations are examples of triangular cooperation sebastian paulo in his orf paper india as a partner in triangular development cooperation explains how india emerged as a promising candidate for triangular cooperation using a detailed analysis of the india uk framework of triangular cooperation this brief will focus on three different triangular cooperation programmes to draw out india s commitment to working with africa in collaboration with three worldwide pioneers i e the us the uk and japan india us cooperation over the past two decades the us and india have fortified their relationship in september 2014 the two conceived a bilateral relationship based on the principle chalein saath forward together we go mentioned in the first vision statement for the strategic partnership this vision statement serves as a manual for reinforcing and developing collaboration for global stability and job led growth over the next 10 years from an economic perspective it is imperative to consolidate individuals in the formal sector of the job market in both skilled and unskilled jobs the statement also included other sectors e g energy and climate change defence and homeland security cooperation high technology space and health cooperation and global issues and regional consultations further expanding their collaboration in the agricultural innovation sector within three african nations the triangular cooperation focused on new sectors namely agricultural productivity clean energy health women s empowerment and disaster preparedness after the first bilateral summit the two partner countries signed the india us statement of guiding principles on triangular cooperation for global development on 3 november 2014 catering to the fulfilment of sustainable development goal 17 sdg 17 during the second bilateral summit held on 25 january 2015 the triangular cooperation was further deepened in africa based on the leitmotif स झ प रय स सबक व क स shared effort progress for all while india and the us have different histories and diverse traditions the two are collaborating to promote growth in the african continent both india and the us have bilateral agreements with africa e g the us africa leaders summit and india africa forum summit the first amendment to the sgp agreement extends the validity of the sgp agreement to 2021 the amended agreement expands the scope of the us india triangular cooperation focusing primarily on agriculture regional connectivity trade and investments nutrition health clean and renewable energy women empowerment disaster preparedness water sanitation education and institution building it also expands the scope of capacity building activities undertaken jointly by the two nations and provides a consultative mechanism for joint biannual monitoring and review of activities under the statement of guiding principles the feed the future india triangular training ftf itt programme launched on 25 july 2016 was a step forward in the us india triangular cooperation programme for africa the stage was set in 2010 with the formulation of the agriculture partnership between the two to achieve a green revolution and address food security globally the feed for future programme is crucial in addressing the issues of massive poverty hunger and malnutrition the programme is implemented by the national institute of agricultural extension management manage hyderabad india an autonomous organisation under the indian ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare it is fully funded by the us and india through usaid and manage respectively the progress of this programme has been commendable the pilot study focused on three african countries kenya liberia and malawi with an aim to expand across the entire continent its initial objective was the training of 1 400 agricultural professionals from 17 partner countries of africa and asia from 2016 to 2020 to address the issues of food and nutritional security as of 30 april 2018 622 executives from 15 countries have been trained the ftf itt offers both practical and theory based training the sessions are delivered through lectures group discussions case studies and field visits and pre and post training tests are conducted to assess their impact the results have revealed that the knowledge of the executives have increased on an average every executive scored 44 30 percent in pre tests and 70 45 percent in post tests with an average change of 26 15 percent in the knowledge level there has been a slow but steady progress to address the issue of massive poverty hunger and malnutrition within the african continent there is a need to institutionalise initiatives cited in the above mentioned agreements as done for the ftf itt india uk cooperation india and uk s relationship has evolved from an aid based donor recipient relationship to a partnership for global development the triangular cooperation between the two works on the principle of the financing for development framework of the 2030 sustainable development agenda the agenda will require a mobilising of resources and capabilities from highly noticeable sources both public and private domestic and international the two nations took this cooperation forward in the fields of defence and security including cyber security maritime security and counterterrorism climate change and disaster resilience in november 2015 the indian ministry of external affairs mea and the uk s department for international development dfid issued the statement of intent on partnership for cooperation in third countries to deepen their cooperation in developing countries while the two countries formally joined hands in 2015 the foundation of the triangular cooperation had been set in 2014 in march 2014 a project called supporting india s trade preferences for africa sita funded by the dfid was implemented by the international trade centre itc the programme was aimed at increasing the value of business transactions between india and africa with the objective of job creation and increased income opportunities this would in turn boost trade in both countries five east african countries ethiopia kenya tanzania rwanda and the united republic of tanzania were selected to create income and employment opportunities the dfid is the donor for this programme providing a funding of 19 million for the duration of 2014 20 the success of the project depends on enhanced access to indian markets and improved partnerships investment the transfer of knowledge expertise and technology from india to east africa by increasing the capacities of east african companies and national and regional trade support institutions tsis stronger public private dialogues and better business linkages since its implementation the sita has had tremendous impact in terms of exports investment and business transactions as of march 2018 exports from east africa amounted to a total of us 22 million us 16 million to india and us 6 million to third countries investment deals worth us 26 5 million were made in the region and us 68 million is under negotiation the sita also ensures women empowerment to allow for equal distribution of economic benefits amongst these value chains of the 47 companies that transacted business 14 were women owned business enterprises the mitreeki east africa india partnership was launched in 2017 with the aim of fostering women entrepreneurs in east africa in its first stage 150 women entrepreneurs received training mentoring and opportunity to access finance through the mitreeki network india has developed cost effective pro poor techniques and innovations in many areas such as health agriculture trade and services which it can apply to africa the uk on the other hand provides all the required resources to implement them the dfid mainly draws on technical and development assistance to build the capacity of partners in india and other developing countries as well as facilitate their relationships the overarching objective is to maximise the development impact of indian partners in generating research mobilising innovations delivering services and promoting economic exchange through investment and trade the uk india triangular cooperation has conceptualised several breakthrough projects the dfid teri partnership for clean energy access and improved policies for sustainable development it is a collaborative action research venture which aims to increase awareness and create a demand for clean energy products and services thereby promoting the use of clean cooking and lighting solutions to poor households the project focuses on kenya and ethiopia and from 2011 to 2015 it has received a total funding of up to 9 million 8 m from dfid india and 1 m from global development partnership programme gdpp for activities in africa the project aimed to reach 200 000 people by 2015 by installing solar lighting and cooking solutions in 40 000 households as of 2015 it has reached over 300 000 people in africa with the installation of 33 000 improved cooking stoves and 23 000 lighting solutions further 10 new technologies and delivery models for clean lighting solutions have already been developed and tested the strategic health and nutrition partnership shnp this project incorporates health financing reforms of india and aims to build networks for learning in other developing countries of africa the programme was implemented in 2013 and continued till 2018 the dfid provided 15 million as technical assistance over these five years 12 m from the india country framework and 3 m from the gdpp fund to expedite the progress on global health coverage health financing and nutrition services the technical support provided using the shnp allowed the goi to channel its resources effectively leading to improved health outcomes particularly for women children and marginalised populations india has excellent technical and manufacturing capacities in the context of pharmaceutical products currently india provides over 80 percent of the drugs used for hiv aids in africa further india s health and nutrition policies can also be employed in the health sectors of other developing countries the global knowledge partnership programme kkp this programme works with many civil society organisations csos and think tanks for expert involvement in policymaking for global public goods in developing countries the kpp received a total funding of 9 million from the dfid 7 m from the gdpp and 2 m from the dfid india from 2012 to 2016 the programme has three objectives gathering and uptake of evidence on issues central to india s national development that have potential for replication in low income countries lics gathering and uptake of evidence on issues central to india s national development having significant impacts on global poverty and promote sharing of indian evidence best practice and expertise with lics in order to facilitate policy review over 55 partners including un organisations international and national ngos and academic institutions are involved in the implementation of the project the kpp covers five major work streams which are nationally focused but have the potential to be developed into india global activities food security resource scarcity and climate change trade and investment health and disease control women and girls and development effectiveness one of the areas of knowledge partnership under food security resource scarcity and climate change is applying indian agribusiness in africa the major achievements of this triangular cooperation include the kpp india ethiopia partnership on economic empowerment and the kpp dfid irena partnership on building energy businesses workshops with business entrepreneurs and inventors from asia and africa and there were findings from the pharmaceutical quality systems with respect to exports from india to africa the global research partnership on food and nutrition security health and women grp this project facilitates capacity building and the brainstorming of ideas with a focus on food security health and women the dfid is to provide up to 7 million from 2014 to 2021 to fund research partnerships between the uk india and lics to address global development challenges by providing new technologies and approaches this partnership will be co funded by the research councils uk rcuk and the goi the innovative ventures and technology for development invent this programme focuses on the technological and business innovations for the poor in eight low income states of india and in developing countries in africa and south asia the invent plan gets maximum funding out of all other strategies i e up to 38 million out of which the dfid has agreed to provide up to 5 million in the form of technical assistance from 2013 to 2021 as of december 2018 invent has developed 127 startups and has committed to invest inr 310 million against the goal of 160 startups and inr 500 million the major sectors covered by the programme were agriculture and allied healthcare livelihood and skill development and education and energy the india uk global partnership programme on development gppd this programme has a funding of 8 million by the dfid from 2018 to 2023 to support india s contribution in delivering global goals and advancing global public goods in other developing nations the gppd comes under the kpp the broad areas of focus are low carbon renewable solar energy led green growth climate resilient infrastructure digital tech led innovative solutions for development and gender equality and emerging indian good practice the first year of the project i e as of april 2019 has focused on creating partnerships and developing policies with exim bank of india observer research foundation research and information system for developing countries and the world bank in the uk india cooperation the dfid plays the crucial role of a facilitator or a broker of partnerships between india and the african continent in triangular cooperation the identification of the demands of the partner countries is essential which are then channelled through an emerging donor and dfid makes this happen india japan cooperation the asia africa growth corridor aagc picked up momentum after the third india africa forum summit iafs held in new delhi in october 2015 like india japan had already been engaging with africa through its five yearly tokyo international conference on african development ticad launched in 1993 to promote africa s development an international conference led by the japanese government and co sponsored by the un the undp the african union commission auc and the world bank the ticad marks the origin of japan s interest in africa to improve development assistance in africa prime ministers narendra modi and shinzo abe issued the aagc declaration in 2016 based on the four pillars of development and cooperation projects quality infrastructure and institutional connectivity enhancing capacities and skills and people to people partnership the aagc aims to promote industrial corridors and industrial networks in asia as well as in africa since 2016 premier policy institutions in consultation with their respective governments have worked on developing the idea e g the research and information system for developing countries ris in india the economic research institute for asean and east asia eria in jakarta and the institute of developing economies japan external trade organisation ide jetro in japan the india japan triangular cooperation with african countries is based on a b2b business to business approach it has been argued that in the short term the b2b approach is easier and more useful than the b2g business to government b2g requires government funding to execute projects while b2b can be led by private investors and foreign direct investments a diversified b2b engagement of indo japanese companies can be an effective medium for enabling the expansion of indian and japanese businesses in africa by engaging with the companies that have been operating in the african subcontinent and establishing a mutuality of trust indian companies can facilitate a speedy expansion the networking efforts by the jetro and the confederation of indian industry cii by virtue of meeting in india uganda and nigeria are testaments to the importance of the same in the medium term the focus of the aagc must be on infrastructure projects both india and japan are building infrastructure in africa which requires coordination amongst the agencies involved in both nations india and japan work together to promote peace stability and prosperity through economic growth and development in the indo pacific including africa towards this goal a small and medium enterprise sme development seminar was organised in kenya further a collaborative project is being considered in the area of health service e g developing a cancer hospital in kenya both india and japan acknowledge that their development cooperation in the indo pacific region will help unlock the potential for an equitable constructive and forward looking change in the region and contribute to africa s socio economic development the two countries have also embraced the idea of expanding cooperation in human resource development capacity building healthcare livelihood water sanitation and digital space as well as broadening access to education and healthcare to help indo pacific citizens realise their potential for development the approach adopted by the iafs and ticad is pan african focusing on priorities such as agenda 2063 the programme for infrastructure development in africa pida and the comprehensive africa agriculture development programme caap the aagc has three objectives advancing both india s and japan s individual and mutual outreach towards the african continent focused mainly on developing quality infrastructure investment linking africa with the indian ocean region within an intercontinental context of asia africa cooperation whereby japan and india are envisaged as playing leading roles with african countries also becoming a part of the decision making process and shaping a liberal and value based indo pacific order as per their proposed vision 2025 conclusion over the years india s engagement in development cooperation activities has made an impact the uk and the us are developed and strong economies with a firm place in the global development arena in terms of track one diplomacy there is a similarity in both the triangular cooperation programmes there is weak government to government engagement paving the way for non state and parastatal actors e g csos think tanks research institutes and the private sector this indicates that while proposals are made at the government level they are implemented through non state actors even the india japan cooperation is based on a b2b approach which maintains a strategic distance from administration communication india and japan began working on the africa path much before the uk and the us were involved with the india japan dialogue on africa running for three years from 2010 however there is yet to be an official proclamation about a triangular collaboration programme between india and japan since the aagc has created a structure for triangular cooperation efforts must now be focused on efficiency and sustainability it is likely that the two nations will declare the association in the next five years it is noteworthy that the india japan cooperation is focused heavily on quality infrastructure in africa to provide alternatives for african countries that have significant chinese economic presence through the belt and road initiative the india us triangular cooperation and the india uk triangular cooperation have similar divisions i e energy and climate women empowerment health investment nutrition and education and both their agreements cover almost all sectors crucial for economic development however the india us agreements are less comprehensive with agriculture emerging as a niche sector and several projects still in the pipeline by comparison the india uk programme is much more diversified with visible results on the ground e g snhp invent and gkp for each segment the dfid has set out the strategies to spike development in both the developing nations the two collaborations also differ in terms of the scale of operations the india uk cooperation receives substantial funding for most of its programmes while the india us cooperation has limited funding one shortcoming in the india uk triangular cooperation is that india is not involved in the funding of the programmes which is done mostly by the dfid india and gdpp in the ftf tt programme meanwhile india is an active participant involved in both the funding and the implementation with manage being an active contributor another point of comparison is the swiftness with which policies are implemented under each collaboration the india japan cooperation has been the slowest since there is no institutionalised triangular cooperation between the two the us india cooperation is better with two agreements that have been formulated and signed by the representatives of both the countries however no action has been taken except the ftf tt programme the india uk triangular cooperation has outperformed both india japan and india us having addressed all the demands of the african continent in the field of development assistance table 1 india s triangular cooperation with the us uk and japan in africa an overview triangular partnerships basis india us india uk india japan track i diplomacy weak existence of a weak government to government dimension weak existence of a weak government to government dimension weak existence of a weak government to government dimension scale of operations narrow only the ftf training programme running vast huge amount of funds available for each project running under this cooperation can t say no institutionalised triangular cooperation between the two nations diversity not diverse other projects still in the pipeline very diverse programme running for almost every sector of development not diverse singular focus on quality infrastructure and equal business partnerships swiftness average agreements formulated but no action except the ftf tt programme strongest almost all demands of the african continent addressed in the field of development assistance slowest no institutionalised triangular cooperation between the two nations triangular cooperation offers benefits such as cost effective development due to the pooling of resources allowing the nations to learn from each other s strengths and experiences however the broader segments need more focus for improved growth a constant capacity building exercise is ongoing by way of emerging donor countries learning from traditional donor countries and partner countries learning from emerging donor countries in a triangular cooperation all three nations involved have different motivations for participating there is a need for increased coordination between all the actors relatively the us and japan have a much better political relationship with india but the uk enjoys better development ties however in all three collaborations there is significant scope for improvement the imperative is to implement all the proposed projects further india must focus on the primary stages when the policies are conceptualised so that it can be actively involved in the planning process along with traditional donor countries

i n the good old days america s budget deficit yawned when the economy was weak and shrank when it was strong it fell from 13 to 4 of gdp during barack obama s presidency as the economy recovered from the financial crisis of 2007 09 today unemployment is at a 50 year low yet borrowing is rising fast tax cuts in 2017 and higher government spending have widened the deficit to 5 5 of gdp according to imf data the largest by far of any rich country listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element it could soon widen even further president donald trump is thought to want a pre election giveaway fox news is awash with rumours of tax cuts 2 0 this month the treasury announced it would issue a 20 year bond which would lengthen the average maturity of its debt and lock in low interest rates for longer all this is quite a change for many republicans who once accused mr obama of profligacy but now say that trillion dollar deficits are no big deal democratic presidential candidates meanwhile are talking about medicare for all and a green new deal a new consensus on fiscal policy has descended on washington can it hold fiscal hawks worry that continued high levels of government borrowing will lead to economic chaos as the engine overheats many of them felt vindicated by the turmoil last year in the repo market through which financial firms lend to each other to buy treasuries investors must hand over money to the government so rising bond issuance caused demand for cash reserves borrowed on repo markets to rise sending rates soaring the federal reserve was forced to step in to provide short term funding aside from that hiccup however markets have taken america s debt binge in their stride in recent months the yield on ten year treasuries has been below 2 interest repayments as a share of gdp are half the level of the early 1990s that is despite there being a far higher stock of debt relative to gdp a sign of investors voracious appetite for safe assets one source of this demand is investors at home much has been made of companies rising stock of debt yet america s firms are now net suppliers of savings to the rest of the economy probably because the money they have raised has been recycled to investors through dividends and share buy backs those corporate savings have to be parked somewhere treasuries are an obvious destination post crisis reforms to the financial system have also played a role commercial banks for instance are now required to hold more high quality liquid assets treasuries are an ideal candidate points out david andolfatto of the federal reserve bank of st louis meanwhile a rule change in late 2016 has reduced the attractiveness of money market funds that invest in corporate debt securities that in turn has increased demand for funds that invest solely in treasuries households have been saving more when the financial crisis hit families fearing for their jobs and pay began to stash money away despite the recovering economy they have not stopped perhaps because of lingering economic uncertainty the personal savings rate is much higher than it was in the 2000s in the past three years households holdings of public debt securities have risen by 70 domestic investors have soaked up two thirds of the extra government borrowing since 2016 foreigners have bought the rest equivalent to 800bn worth of treasuries as a consequence america is now an even bigger net borrower from the rest of the world its current account deficit has widened to around 2 5 of gdp it is no surprise that investors have an appetite for american debt policy uncertainty abounds not least thanks to mr trump s enthusiasm for threatening trade war there are few other havens germany s insistence on running super tight fiscal policy means there is an undersupply of bunds argues brad setser of the council on foreign relations a think tank traders moan that the market for japan s government bonds is illiquid investors based in europe appear to have been the most enthusiastic buyers see chart in part that reflects some countries large trade surpluses in the past year norway a big oil exporter has doubled its holdings but that does not explain why belgium a country of 11m people is one of the world s biggest foreign buyers of treasuries although official purchases by china look stable some suspect that it is making some of its purchases through belgian intermediaries fiscal favours can america s government deficit remain so wide for much longer some economists worry that loose fiscal policy at a time of low unemployment will cause the economy to overheat rousing inflation that would force the federal reserve to raise interest rates and push up government borrowing costs so far though there is little sign of that inflation is oddly soggy the fed cut rates three times last year

by farouk martins aresa there are africans that call for the return of their colonial masters that can be held responsible since african politicians are worse so irresponsible these politicians are selling out everything from government corporations parastatals natural resources to raiding and laundering foreign reserves it is nothing short of divestment by african politicians indirectly giving major shares back to the same foreign corporations and businesses without responsibility that had handed over during indigenization period isabel dos santos africa s richest woman whose father was the president of angola got access to lucrative deals involving land oil diamonds and telecoms another african country rich in natural resources looted worse than nigeria s former oil and petroleum minister diezani madueke did isabel dos santos and her husband were allowed to buy valuable angola state assets in a series of deals typical in most african countries the total amount of foreign investments and foreign aid coming into africa are dwarfed by the amount of kickbacks obnoxious profits and money laundering leaking out of africa legally and illegally each time some of the money looted by politicians and their crony businessmen are eventually repatriated after taking out legal and administrative expenses the returned money is looted again by successive politicians nevertheless african politicians continue to pursue foreigners to deliver them importing experts financial gurus and foreign portfolio investors by incentivizing them with high interest rate returns that can never be sustained and profitable for local businesses or corporations to borrow one may wonder what types of expertise were needed that could not have been trained in any african country since independence in 60 years however training and producing these materials know how and experts at home would block the major loopholes for foreign contracts used by new administrations and their cronies to enrich one another if the local money kept in reserves were invested at home there would be no need to beg or depend on foreign investments from outside they bank most of their loots overseas pauperizing africa nigerian presidential candidate atiku like isabel actually boasted during the campaign that he would sell most of the parastatals as he did as vice president without any advantage to his country politicians ordered central bank to facilitate the transfer of parastatals for their private companies they borrowed the money from private banks to acquire parastatals and let the banks liquidate central bank then bailed them out actually so called foreign portfolio investors main job is to watch developing countries foreign reserves grow so that foreign investors can get ready to make a kill this is why they send out newsletters about which country is ripe enough to be labeled best place to do business emerging markets direct foreign investments the leader in 100 years and more flatteries the local stock market would shoot up based on hot air they would then take their profit out of the country until the cycle is repeated again why do africans echo or rely on the hot air projections of the fox waiting to raid the chicken coop they aid and abet the raiders for crumbs and access indeed once the foreign reserve has grown large enough super powers or corporations can just sell an old fighter jet to one african country for use against its neighbor it is enough to deplete a good part of their foreign reserves most african french speaking countries cannot even touch their foreign reserve in france without the approval of old colonial master think about it foreigners are helping africans deplete local foreign reserves since they know looters do not invest at home without killer profits foreigners would not be rushing to africa to make money either but if foreign investors are given stipulations on long term goals like infrastructure they would label that country hostile without free market or call upon their government to sanction it the free and fair reciprocal market they do not have in their own countries they rig their own economy for the big boys politicians are after foreign odious loans that are known to be going into private pockets based on some warped logic that united states the richest country in the world borrows from the chinese japanese and germans this logic is used by lagos to make tinubu richer than the state itself however usa prints its own 100 00 bills that is worldly popular and abundant outside their country than inside credit worthy is not bankruptcy foreign investors look out for themselves africa must bail itself out like other countries usa can pay back on demand by printing more 100 bills that would be snatched up by many countries including those burying hard currencies in sewage tanks mortuaries or transfer it to their shell companies in panama like other billionaires hiding their money but how acceptable are naira cedi rand shillings or zimbabwe dollar outside africa it must hastily be noted that heavy government involvement in the economy apart from regulations could be detrimental as in government business is nobody s business it is usually the functions of the private sector businesses and corporations to create jobs the role of governments is to step in where private businesses may be overwhelmed as hospitals schools and infrastructure but must create an enabling environment for all however if china had waited for the private sector to bail the country out of famine and poverty it suffered while africa was flowing with milk and honey china would not be a major competitor on the world stage with united states china uses its influence as a nuclear power and took advantage of western spite against soviet union to gain access to the rich countries trade club indira gandhi former prime minister of indian had called for the same access fair and free trade not handouts china and india have reduced the world s poverty by pulling many of their poor people into middle class while africa s poor keep on increasing china has done so by sensible government interventions and severe punishment for corruption on the other hand african countries with relatively huge income had more money sucked out by foreign pensions and equity investors looking for maximum return in the shortest possible time foreign investors hardly embarked on a long term major project like infrastructure without demanding guarantees or sureties that the same projects would revert back to foreign control if they default always did on the odious loans most loans are bribes for inflated contract between parties to employ their foreign workers as supervisors and above while africans remain laborers the odious loans are not only inflated both parties anticipate defaults because they are not reasonably packaged for payback therefore it is not surprising that chinese are taking over land and infrastructure in zambia ghana sold its major gold industry to foreign investors and nigeria s ajaokuta steel industry has never been viable nigeria paris loan penalties and fines ballooned most of the major industries that were supposed to be major contributors to the countries foreign reserves have actually become a drain on africa s reserves in each country by divestment

is appropriate to provide for probable incurred credit losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at december 31 2019 operating results net interest income decreased 1 1 million or 2 2 to 49 1 million for the quarter ended december 31 2019 from 50 2 million for the linked quarter ended september 30 2019 due primarily to a decrease in the yield of interest earning assets as interest rates on adjustable rate instruments decreased following 50 and 25 basis point decreases in short term market rates during the quarters ended september 30 2019 and december 31 2019 respectively net interest income decreased 2 2 million or 4 2 compared to 51 3 million for the same period in 2018 due to a decrease in the yield of interest earning assets primarily as a result of a downward shift in the yield curve since the fourth quarter of 2018 and a lagging increase in the cost of total interest bearing deposits net interest margin decreased 19 basis points to 4 02 for the quarter ended december 31 2019 from 4 21 for the linked quarter ended september 30 2019 due primarily to decreases in loan yields net interest margin decreased 35 basis points from 4 37 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 due primarily to decreases in loan yields and secondarily due to a change in the mix of earning assets and increases in the cost of total interest bearing deposits the change in the mix of earning assets a lower ratio of higher yielding loans and investment securities as a percentage of total earning assets had an unfavorable impact of four basis points on the net interest margin from the prior quarter loan yield decreased 16 basis points to 5 00 for the quarter ended december 31 2019 from 5 16 for the linked quarter ended september 30 2019 due primarily to decreases in short term market rates during the quarter ended december 31 2019 of this decrease two basis points was due to a change in impact of nonaccrual loan activity from the prior quarter loan yield was also impacted by higher than historical loan activity both originations and prepayments which occurred during the lower rate environment of the quarter ended december 31 2019 loan yield decreased 25 basis points from 5 25 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 due primarily to lower short term market rates during the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 of this decrease six basis points was due to a change in impact of nonaccrual loan activity from the same quarter in the prior year the impact on loan yield from incremental accretion on purchased loans decreased one basis point to 0 11 for the quarter ended december 31 2019 from 0 12 for the linked quarter ended september 30 2019 and decreased eight basis points from 0 19 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 the decreases were primarily a result of the decrease in the balances of loans acquired in the mergers with puget sound bancorp inc and premier commercial bancorp the premier and puget mergers both of which occurred in 2018 the incremental accretion and the impact to loan yield will change during any period based on the volume of prepayments but it is expected to decrease over time as the balance of the purchased loans decreases the following table presents the net interest margin loan yield and the effect of the incremental accretion on purchased loans on

or 6 5 to 9 0 million for the quarter ended december 31 2019 from 8 5 million for the linked quarter ended september 30 2019 due primarily to an increase in interest rate swap fees the company also recognized other income in the amount of 230 000 related to the sale of of two branch properties and other fixed assets during the quarter ended december 31 2019 the increase in noninterest income was offset partially by decreases in gain on sale of investments and gain on sale of loans net during the quarter ended december 31 2019 noninterest income increased 566 000 or 6 7 from 8 4 million for

1 3 million of which 657 000 was due to compensation and employee benefits expense there were no acquisition related expenses incurred during the quarter ended december 31 2019 the decrease in

the united states federal budget deficit is currently projected to explode increasing the federal debt to unprecedentedly high levels a very gradual fiscal consolidation with federal spending as a share of gdp declining slightly each year would both raise economic growth and create a more resilient economy stanford in recent years the u s government has taken several essential economic policy steps the tax reform embedded in the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tcja the recent united states mexico canada usmca trade agreement phase one of a china u s trade deal and recent regulatory reforms are all needed to revive and strengthen economic growth it is now time for another essential policy step correcting the trajectory of fiscal policy the congressional budget office s cbo current baseline projection of federal government spending in future years far outpaces federal government revenue as the figure below clearly shows the result is an exploding federal budget deficit which will bring the federal debt as a share of gdp to 144 percent by 2049 according to the cbo baseline and likely to the 219 percent projected in the cbo s alternative fiscal scenario these debt levels are unprecedented in u s history in contrast to previous periods when the deficit fell after similar upward bursts the current cbo projections show no such reversal the large deficit will crowd out important federal programs including needed infrastructure investment as well as private investment needed for economic growth debt service will account for a rising share of spending and the high debt will likely increase interest rates by more than the cbo assumes leading to an economically perilous debt spiral it does not have to be this way the figure also shows a sensible target for spending as a share of gdp establishing a path toward fiscal consolidation this target moves very gradually by only 0 1 percentage point per year reducing the share of federal spending in gdp from 20 7 percent to 19 5 percent this gradual path does not represent austerity in any meaningful sense federal spending would grow at a rate slightly less than the growth rate of gdp leading to smaller deficits over time if credible the plan would have no negative demand effects on gdp according to cbo research that i cited when i testified before the house budget committee in november such a target would lead to higher gdp growth and more income per person in contrast to current cbo projections of exploding deficits but achieving this target means that the future expenditure share of gdp would be substantially lower than projected by the cbo under current policy as john cogan explains in his recent book the high cost of good intentions consolidation paths like this require reforms that boost the efficiency of government programs such as keeping the growth of social security spending per person in line with inflation some economists such as jason furman of harvard university s kennedy school have argued for another type of fiscal reform which would increase the magnitude of automatic stabilizers i disagree yes there are good reasons for the federal deficit to rise automatically during economic downturns and to fall during booms such movements tend to stabilize the economy and they occur automatically as a result of programs like unemployment compensation and a progressive tax system but automatic stabilizers have been working well for many years regression estimates show that their recent size has been about the same as it has been for the past half century as real gdp declines relative to its potential that is as the output gap rises spending growth increases and tax revenue growth declines resulting in a larger cyclical deficit from 2000 to 2018 the output gap accounted for 38 percent of the cyclical component of the deficit about the same as the 36 percent share over the five decades from 1969 to 2018 based on data from the cbo s january 28 2019 report on the automatic stabilizers one can see this relationship in the scatter plot below showing the cyclical deficit and the gdp gap during 1969 2018 the dots are scattered tightly around a straight line with a slope of 0 36 one reason sometimes given to justify strengthening the automatic stabilizers is that monetary policy can no longer do the job because it is constrained by the zero bound on interest rates but it is better to fix monetary policy by using rules including rules for forward guidance than it is to change the automatic stabilizer component of fiscal policy when the problem lies elsewhere the current federal budget is off track and needs to be reformed the problem is that spending is projected to grow too rapidly relative to revenues not that the deficit responds too modestly to the ups and downs in the economy the reform suggested here would focus on the problem with a very gradual fiscal consolidation which would make the policy process more permanent

the full quarter impact of the bannockburn acquisition along with near record level client derivative fees and sustained mortgage banking volume drove noninterest income higher expenses were elevated during the period primarily due to the write down of a historic tax credit investment and higher incentive compensation resulting from our strong operating results however our adjusted efficiency

range on the funding side we were particularly pleased with a very much improved deposit mix average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased by more than 16 annualized and time deposits fell by a similar percentage and our loan to deposit ratio declined to 107 our efficiency ratio was 41 8 and tangible book value per share increased by 0 46 during the quarter to 16 06 tangible book value per share has increased by 11 3 over the past year looking ahead we remain diligently focused on our strategic priorities which include solid organic growth in loans and deposits improvements in operating efficiency through use of technology and superior returns on investor capital on the m a front we are focused on flawless execution on completed transactions and remain opportunistic regarding potential future deals operating results fully taxable equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 47 9 million a decrease of 1 0 million or 2 0 from the third quarter of 2019 resulting primarily from an 8 basis point contraction of the net interest margin to 3 36 from 3 44 included in net interest income were purchase accounting adjustments of 1 5 million during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 1 6 million during the third quarter of 2019 excluding purchase accounting adjustments the adjusted net interest margin was 3 26 for the fourth quarter of 2019 7 basis points lower than the adjusted net interest margin of 3 33 for the third quarter of 2019 the adjusted net interest margin contracted primarily due to lower prepayment and other fees on loans while the decline in adjusted asset yields was largely offset by a lower cost of deposits and an improved funding mix noninterest income was essentially unchanged at 2 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 versus 2 1 million in the third quarter of 2019 and higher than the 1 6 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 the increases from 2018 were due to the acquisitions of greater hudson and boefly higher deposit fees additional boli income and increases in gains on the sale of loans noninterest expenses totaled 22 2 million for fourth quarter of 2019 20 4 million for the third quarter of 2019 and 18 3

when compared to the third quarter of 2019 the decrease versus the third quarter 2019 was primarily attributable to decreases in marketing and advertising occupancy and equipment and fdic insurance expense offset by increases in compensation expenses related to a larger staff and higher cash and equity based compensation accruals the increase versus the year ago fourth quarter of 2018 was largely due to the aforementioned acquisitions income tax expense was 6 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 6 4 million for the third quarter of 2019 and 3 6 million for the fourth quarter of

compared with 15 2 for the full year 2018 the increase in 2019 effective tax rates were primarily due an increase in taxable income and the negative impact of recent tax legislation in new jersey

several state legislators issued statements following the state of the state address by wisconsin gov tony evers on wednesday night rep katrina shankland d stevens point everyone deserves the confidence of fair maps and fair representation and i am thrilled to see governor evers leading on this issue and highlighting it in his state of the state address i have been a proud cosponsor of nonpartisan redistricting reform legislation every session since i was first elected and i m especially pleased that yesterday the portage county board of supervisors also unanimously passed a resolution to authorize a referendum giving the people a say on the issue of fair maps i frequently hear from folks about the need for nonpartisan redistricting and i m very proud that portage county is letting the people weigh in on fair maps supervisors meleesa johnson and vinnie miresse championed the resolution and i am grateful for their strong leadership supervisor miresse said we ve had a lot of opportunities to fix this and now we can let the people of wisconsin decide who s going to represent them rather than the other way around wisconsin has a long history of being a nonpartisan and purple state and it s time we bring that back and work together i agree with supervisor miresse it s time we work together i am pleased to have portage county supervisors vinnie miresse and chai moua as my guests in the capitol for the state of the state address tonight as the governor continues to lead on fair maps i also am pleased that governor evers chose to highlight the need to cap the cost of insulin it s unacceptable that people are forced to ration their insulin because of the exorbitant cost of their life saving medicine in a moral society everyone has access to the medicine they need to stay alive and thrive that s why i m proud to be a coauthor of legislation to cap the price of insulin at 100 month and i will continue to advocate for affordable prescription medicine so no one goes without finally we must act now to support rural development and help our farmers i am glad governor evers discussed the need for us to support our family farmers who have supported our state for generations it s long past time that we support them in turn i am glad that governor evers recognizes the need for action and am pleased by the dedication he has shown to taking meaningful comprehensive steps forward for our farmers and rural communities state rep evan goyke d milwaukee governor evers demonstrated again tonight why citizens across wisconsin elected him to lead our state he continues to move our state in the right direction as legislative republicans continue to try to keep up tonight the governor highlighted that there is more work to do i am proud to support the coming efforts on rural economic development and non partisan redistricting and as always i will continue to work in the legislature on issues i am passionate about including reform to our juvenile and adult corrections systems in wisconsin it has been 671 days since every legislator voted to close lincoln hills and institute the wisconsin model for juvenile corrections as of tonight not one shovel has been put into the ground and not one juvenile moved into a new more effective facility closer to home it s time to fulfill the promise we made almost two years ago i stand with governor evers in getting the job done it s time to get to work sen janis ringhand d evansville first of all i would like to thank governor evers for providing some much needed balance to the hyper partisanship that pervaded the state capitol prior to his election we can all agree on the importance of good schools good roads clean water and high quality affordable health care for everyone in wisconsin under the leadership of governor evers we worked together to increase funding for education we have finally begun to rebuild our deteriorating infrastructure and we will continue to fight to reign in prescription drug prices and protect coverage for those with pre existing conditions i wholeheartedly support governor evers call to finally give homeowners a break by closing the dark store tax loophole nearly two thirds of the state senate are sponsors of the legislation to fix the dark store tax scheme republicans continue to block a vote on this important legislation for homeowners it s time for republicans to stand up to the corporate lobbyists and give homeowners a fair shake for a change rep lisa subeck d madison tonight in his state of the state address governor evers reflected on 2019 and looked forward to 2020 highlighting values and goals important to the people of wisconsin despite obstructionist attempts by republicans to stand in the way of his efforts to move wisconsin forward under governor evers s leadership we have cut taxes for middle class families made new investments in our public schools and addressed our aging roads and infrastructure needs the governor is right when he says that the people of wisconsin deserve elected leaders who put our families and our communities ahead of partisan politics the governor made it clear tonight that he and democrats in the legislature want to work together with republicans on issues important to wisconsin we can find common ground on capping insulin prices closing the dark store tax loophole preventing youth vaping and addressing homelessness and this is just the start i stand with governor evers when he says it is time to set politics aside and to work together to move our state forward assembly democratic leader gordon hintz d oshkosh tonight governor evers laid out a clear vision for wisconsin s future he highlighted the opportunities we have as a state and what we can accomplish in the remainder of the legislative session rep hintz stated his agenda focuses on the issues that matter to wisconsin families health care costs public education and an economy that works for everyone as the governor pointed out in his speech these should be easy bipartisan wins because they affect every legislative district in the state the people of wisconsin deserve elected officials who will show up and get to work on their behalf with two months left in the legislative session we have the time to accomplish so much for the people we serve we are at our best when we work together to get things done it is my hope that we can take on these challenges in a bipartisan manner without being stopped by gatekeepers in republican leadership who are more concerned with thwarting governor evers than creating opportunity across the state sen jon erpenbach d west point while we made great strides this past year under governor evers leadership there is still a lot more to do said senator erpenbach we are ready to reach across the aisle on vital issues such as addressing homelessness ensuring access to affordable health care and making sure our economy works for everyone wisconsinites expect their representatives to show up for them their families and our communities we are ready to get to work rep barbara dittrich r oconomowoc the state of our state continues to move forward in the right direction thanks to solid conservative policies thanks to the leadership of our republican legislature and joint finance committee we have an expanding economy vibrant job market and continuing access to quality health care said rep dittrich our policy reforms and conservative principles have been paying off for the state but our work is far from over a major accomplishment this session included the conservative state budget signed by governor evers which democrats voted against the 2019 2021 state budget increased access to affordable health care cut taxes by more than 400 million made historic investments in roads and schools and expanded worker training programs additionally issues like adoption suicide prevention mental health and water quality were addressed through bipartisan task forces i am focused on issues that bring people together unlike the governor who seems to focus only on madison and milwaukee said rep dittrich our state s progress will not be hindered by a liberal governor who ignores rural wisconsin wants to expand welfare and increases spending we cannot merely solve our state s challenges by throwing more money at them i am always ready to do the hard work of exploring positive solutions rep dave considine d baraboo governor evers spoke tonight about the importance of having elected officials who show up and get to work to me getting to work means putting in the time to hear bills that our colleagues write getting to work means staying in session until the work is done not until we decide we ve done or heard enough we need to listen even if we disagree one of the issues governor evers highlighted was agriculture he spoke of wisconsin s strength as an agricultural leader and how we need to support our farmers producers have contributed to wisconsin s economy for years and it s time we showed them the same support as ranking member on the assembly committee on agriculture i agree our committee has held public hearings for 8 bills in the past year despite the fact that 21 bills were sent to us to be heard i support governor evers call for the special session on agriculture because i have witnessed my colleagues dragging their feet on this issue i am eager to take meaningful action on bills to support our producers processors and rural communities another issue that governor evers spoke about was homelessness and how we can work together to end it this is an important issue for the 81st as there aren t currently any shelter beds for men in sauk county governor evers introduced reverend dave mowers in his speech and highlighted his tireless work to bring a shelter to baraboo i am proud of the people in the 81st assembly district hardworking people like reverend mowers however i know we can t rely solely on the efforts of dedicated people in our communities we also need to work at the state level to support our communities who do this work in governor evers speech i heard calls to action on important issues like agriculture and homelessness and so much more i am hopeful that all of us in the legislature can get to work and do the job we were elected to do i look forward to hearing and passing bills to bolster our agricultural communities and aid our homeless senate democratic leader jennifer shilling d la crosse it couldn t be clearer that the public overwhelmingly supports gov evers and democratic solutions to propel our state forward democrats believe in prioritizing the people of wisconsin and addressing the issues residents face every single day by lowering health care costs strengthening clean water protections and expanding economic security for families and seniors whether it s accepting federal health dollars closing the dark store loophole investing in local schools or legalizing medical marijuana wisconsin residents trust democratic efforts to tackle the tough issues i believe these goals are well within our reach but time is of the essence as legislators we cannot ask the people of wisconsin to settle for any less than they deserve the longer republicans refuse to do their job the longer these challenges facing our communities will persist my democratic colleagues and i remain committed to working with gov evers to advance bold solutions and ensure wisconsin is a place where the next generation wants to live work and raise a family rep sondy pope d mt horeb i am proud to stand with a governor who genuinely cares for the people he serves over the past year governor evers has put politics aside and has offered ideas that will improve the lives of ordinary citizens his initiatives focused on tackling the student debt crisis improving water quality and improving public health demonstrate common priorities with wisconsinites across the state as mentioned in the address the vaping epidemic is a serious threat to public health i am thrilled to be working with the governor to face this problem head on specifically within our schools student health is directly correlated to student success and it is my hope that our commonsense proposal to ban vaping on school premises makes our students safer healthier and more successful i call on my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to do what s right for our kids and get this bill to governor evers desk the governor s ability to take action on pressing issues with vigor and urgency is why he was elected by the citizens of wisconsin i applaud the path and direction he has set for our state and look forward to continuing the work to advance an agenda that work for the people rep jodi emerson d eau claire our state accomplished a lot in 2019 but there is still much work to do in the new year we need to work together on the pressing issues facing our state from jobs and the economy to health care and criminal justice reform job creation should be a priority but there is more to an economy than just counting jobs hardworking wisconsinites deserve jobs that pay well and allow for a good quality of life investing in our workforce is the foundation to growing our economy the 91st district has one of the highest poverty rates in the state and good paying family supporting jobs are what we need to move our community forward i also stand with governor evers in support of nonpartisan redistricting fair elections are fundamental to our democratic system and elected officials shouldn t be able to ignore their constituents on the issues that matter to them and their families as 2020 begins i stand ready to work with governor evers and my colleagues in both parties on the important issues facing our state it s what our constituents want it is time to set politics aside and work to move wisconsin forward together senate majority leader scott fitzgerald r juneau during his first year in office governor evers pushed a liberal agenda that taxed too much spent too much and would have undone a large number of reforms that turned wisconsin s economy around i ve been proud to stand with my conservative colleagues in the senate in opposition to his left leaning policies it is my hope that the governor will spend what is left of the legislative session to focus on issues that put wisconsin families first i m eager to hear his plans for helping agriculture in wisconsin additionally the senate will continue our efforts to crack down on repeat violent criminals and work on a tax cut for hard working wisconsinites over the last decade wisconsin has made tremendous strides the state of our state is strong republican backed reforms continue to fuel our state s economy and have our state budget in the best shape in decades i am confident that we will continue to move wisconsin forward rep mark spreitzer d beloit governor evers s state of the state address highlighted the successes of the past year including strong investments in our students and public schools and our local roads and transportation infrastructure governor evers also focused on issues that the legislature must take up before the end of this legislative session i look forward to working with my colleagues to address issues that are important to the people of our state like non partisan redistricting lowering the cost of health care reducing student loan debt and closing the dark store loophole i am pleased that governor evers has called a special session of the legislature next week focused on legislation that will invest in our farmers and rural communities as a member of the assembly committee on agriculture i am acutely aware that our state is facing an agricultural crisis i have heard firsthand from farmers about their struggles in a volatile agricultural economy the governor previewed common sense solutions to ensure wisconsin farmers have the resources they need in these challenging times including increasing support staff at uw extension and expanding access to mental health resources wisconsin farmers can t wait and we must pass common sense bipartisan solutions now i would like to thank governor evers for his continued commitment to bipartisanship and his dedication to getting things done for the people of wisconsin i look forward to continuing to work with the governor and my colleagues in the legislature on these critical issues rep dianne hesselbein d middleton there are many issues governor evers laid out tonight that democrats in the legislature are ready and willing to work on with our republican colleagues we are ready to get to work on capping insulin prices finally closing the dark store loophole addressing homelessness and many other important priorities it s only the beginning of the year and we have enough time to set politics aside and work on solutions for these issues one issue i was glad to hear in governor evers speech was non partisan redistricting i agree with governor evers that we need to make sure our elections are fair and that people get to choose their politicians not the other way around that s why i recently introduced a constitutional amendment on non partisan redistricting the overwhelming majority of wisconsinites agree that we need fair maps so let s give them a chance to vote on it there is a great opportunity to work together this year and truly address the problems that are facing wisconsin the people we represent deserve to have elected officials who show up and get things done for their families that s what i m here to do rep melissa sargent d madison over the past year under the leadership of governor evers we have made strides in moving wisconsin forward to a more equitable future from increasing education funding by nearly 100 million dollars and signing into law a multitude of bipartisan bills to traveling across the state to hear the voices of the people of our state governor evers has proven his commitment to putting politics aside and getting to work for the people of wisconsin while governor evers has taken great steps forward for our state tonight he also reflected on the work that remains we know that wisconsinites want our government to get to work and to do what is right for themselves their families and our communities we know that wisconsin residents want real relief including fair wages reducing student debt and bettering college affordability and ensuring quality and affordable healthcare further wisconsinites want fair government through nonpartisan redistricting and campaign finance reforms which protects the foundational principle of one person one vote finally the people of wisconsin want to help their friends and neighbors through measures such as ensuring clean drinking water and assisting homeless individuals in our state these are nonpartisan issues that require bipartisan action to be taken i commend the governor for recognizing the work that is left to be done for our state and his call upon the legislature to come together to address these vital areas we have a limited time to act as a legislative body before the end of the session and it is important that the majority party take action now to bring these issues to the floor it is past time to set politics aside and to get to work i am committed to rolling up my sleeves and continuing to work across the aisle to fight for these pragmatic policies here in the state capitol sen van h wanggaard r racine i was very disappointed in tonight s speech rather than reach out a hand of partnership he lectured and scolded rather than seeking common ground he outlined and celebrated an extreme left agenda rather than focus on the future he focused on old battles and cheap shots his speaking pattern may sound moderate but his words and actions are not in short it was the perfect embodiment of his first year in office rep robyn vining d wauwatosa i appreciate the commitment governor evers has to making our state the best it can be for its residents we have worked hard the past year and i am excited for the hard work to continue in 2020 last year i authored the fair maps bill to create a nonpartisan redistricting process for wisconsin i am thankful that governor evers supports the bipartisan fair maps efforts and is continuing our work in 2020 to promote good government and a fair democracy after all voters should get to choose their politicians politicians should not get to choose their voters public health and safety is paramount to my work as a legislator especially when it comes to our kids youth vaping has increased dramatically in the past few years and i am grateful to work alongside governor evers and state agencies with legislation to protect kids from the health risks of vaping and protect consumers from improper business practices small business is the backbone of our state governor evers and i have been working on a small business portal and we will keep working to go big for small business i look forward to continuing my work with governor evers and my colleagues in the legislature on the issues that wisconsinites care about forward together rep david bowen d milwaukee i was optimistic at this time last year to work with gov evers and legislative republicans on bipartisan solutions to address the issues facing our communities what i have found now however is that republican leadership would prefer legislative inaction over advancing the many bipartisan bills that have been introduced this session that have yet to receive the time of day from bills to protect sex trafficking victims to bills that are supported by the majority of wisconsinites like medicaid expansion and non partisan redistricting it is disappointing that republicans would rather focus on what they can take credit for than pass legislation that would move our state forward governor evers addressed a joint session of the state assembly and state senate tonight for his second state of the state address in his speech he outlined the progress that wisconsin has made so far under his leadership and laid out a progressive vision for what he intends to achieve in his second year in office and beyond after one year in office governor evers has shown that even in divided government he is committed to investing in our communities and our state following through on the promises he made to voters from criminal justice reform to investing in our children governor evers has called on the legislature to act on policies that wisconsinites want and frankly are long overdue however there is only so much he can accomplish without the support of legislative republicans i am proud to have a governor that is committed to addressing the racial disparities in wisconsin one of the most segregated states in the country whether it is closing the achievement gap between white and black students increasing the number of black teachers in our classrooms or addressing the racial disparities in our criminal justice system and expanding economic growth all over wisconsin i look forward to working with governor evers and republicans in making sure that these policies become reality rep chris taylor d madison i applaud all of the hard work that governor evers and lieutenant governor barnes have done over the last year to prioritize the people of this state over politics from the historic people s budget that funded the needs of communities throughout the state to important executive actions like creation of the office of equity and inclusion to simply rebuilding morale among our state workers we have seen firsthand how different state government can be when we have a governor who puts kids families and communities first tonight s speech highlighted one issue that i am particularly concerned about the climate crisis after the irresponsible policies of the previous administration the evers administration has moved our state forward in the last year by recognizing that climate change is real and we must take it seriously the evers administration and secretary cole finally brought science back to the department of natural resources and lieutenant governor barnes has led on the issue of sustainability as chair of the governor s task force on climate change we owe it to our children and future generations to find solutions to this crisis and i appreciate all the evers administration has done and will continue to do to protect our environment and among the many initiatives the governor unveiled tonight including a task force on student debt and several bill to reinvigorate our agricultural economy perhaps the most important proposal was governor evers executive order to create the people s maps commission so that we can finally bring fair nonpartisan redistricting to our state as the governor stated despite 70 support for medicaid expansion and 80 support for medical marijuana legalization universal background checks and extreme risk protection orders republican lawmakers have failed to act wisconsin needs fair maps so the people of this state can actually choose their lawmakers and hold them accountable not the other way around we have made several strides forward in the last year and i am excited to continue working with governor evers as he leads us toward a fairer more just wisconsin assembly majority leader jim steineke r kaukauna the work we ve done over the last year to curb governor evers liberal wish list has resulted in our state being in a great position said rep steineke thanks to our conservative values and willingness to fight for wisconsin priorities our students and schools are thriving healthcare is affordable and accessible and our state is a great place to live work and play while the governor was able to expand his view beyond just madison and milwaukee tonight sadly a majority of his state of the state address touted priorities that speak only to liberal hubs after months of focusing on growing the size of government expanding welfare and largely ignoring the needs of rural communities tonight s speech was much more of the same i m incredibly disappointed that in the governor s first year in the east wing he has not learned that we are able to best serve wisconsinites when we all come to the table to find solutions that work for everyone continued rep steineke the governor continues to say that he wants to work across the aisle but his actions of endlessly pushing the legislature to the side tell a very different story despite the conservative wisconsin budget receiving no votes from democrats rep steineke is proud that there was bipartisan support for more than 95 of votes in the assembly finding common ground on so many bills was an indicator of the legislature s ability to work together for the betterment of wisconsin unfortunately tonight s speech indicated that this year will bring more instances of the governor working to circumvent the legislative process in 2019 governor evers signed a record 61 executive orders as a first year governor indicating an unwillingness to work with the legislature in tonight s address the governor laid out three new executive orders that will once again attempt to remove the co equal branches of government from the law making process while governor evers is focused on finding ways to get around working together i will continue to focus on the priorities and values of my constituents said rep steineke the state of our state is strong and we in the legislature are committed to doing the hard work needed to keep it that way sen alberta darling r river hills i was encouraged to hear governor evers celebrate the investments in the budget passed by the joint committee on finance and republicans even though not a single democrat voted in favor of the plan ironically evers 95 bipartisan rate could have been even higher if democrats had supported these investments instead of playing politics wisconsin continues to thrive because republicans prevented governor evers from hiking taxes by more than 1 billion and putting billions more on the credit cards instead republicans delivered a balanced budget that taxpayers could afford we delivered a middle class tax cut and provided the largest real dollar increase for k 12 education in our state s history our reforms and careful budgeting helped turn around wisconsin s economy and we won t go back it s great to hear governor evers is traveling the state but too often his ideas continue to originate from madison he ignored rural wisconsin in his last budget and even tried to raise taxes on businesses that supply farmers i m glad he is realizing his mistake i m disappointed the governor continues to ignore the workforce shortage in our state it s also shocking that the former dpi secretary refuses to address why so many students aren t reading at their grade level instead of lecturing i encourage him to listen to voices throughout wisconsin and learn to work together on these issues i m proud of the work my colleagues and i have accomplished not only this session but over the last decade our reforms and investments are working the state of the state is strong now it s time to continue moving wisconsin forward rep john nygren r marinette governor evers sudden concern for rural wisconsin and our agriculture industry is ironic given that just a year ago he proposed raising taxes on the agriculture industry to pay for expanded welfare programs said rep nygren governor evers spent his first year in office catering to his far left liberal friends in madison no amount of rhetoric can cover his failed record of putting rural wisconsin and our farmer behind liberal special interests unfortunately governor evers spent his first year in office trying to undo all the positive momentum of the last eight years said rep nygren between the largest property tax increase in the last 10 years attempts to put more wisconsinites on welfare and a blatant disregard for state law the last year for governor evers has been unacceptable wisconsin needs governor evers to change course in year two the state of the state is strong not because of governor evers but in spite of him said rep nygren republicans in the legislature have spent the last year listening to families all across wisconsin and advancing an agenda for all of wisconsin not just madison and milwaukee governor evers needs to reverse course and begin listening to all of wisconsin instead of only the liberal special interests rep shelia stubbs d madison governor evers acknowledged that education related debt creates issues of access for our wisconsin students and their families tackling the student loan debt crisis would make education more accessible for folks in wisconsin what s best for kids is what s best for our state rep stubbs stated governor evers knows that we should make voting more accessible for wisconsinites not more difficult we need nonpartisan redistricting to make sure that our elections are fair and that people get to choose their elected officials not the other way around governor evers discussed his executive orders 1 and 59 which affirm diversity inclusion respect and dignity for wisconsin workers and communities governor evers is committed to creating access to equal opportunities for all wisconsinites rep lakeshia myers d milwaukee it was refreshing to hear governor evers state of the state address in his address he outlined the successes and challenges faced in his first year as governor as well as his plans for the immediate future i applaud governor evers for creating a task force on student debt because of looming student debt millennials and other young adults are struggling to purchase homes and support families i hope the task force will tackle the issues of predatory lending by for profit colleges and other abusive practices to protect wisconsinites struggling with student loan debt as a person with substantial student loan debt i understand the frustration that comes from having loans balloon with compounding interest young adults are stifled because of the debt and are having to wait longer to make significant purchases and start families which was not the case for prior generations student debt should not be a life sentence but for many in our state it is i was excited to hear about the upcoming special session to address agriculture serving on the agriculture committee allows me the opportunity to showcase and educate others on the expansion of urban farming in order for our state to move forward urban as well as rural communities must work together to expand the economic interests of our state governor evers plan to connect farmers beyond the traditional scope of agriculture is a step in the right direction i am hopeful at the prospects of both rural and urban farmers working together to increase hemp production agribusiness manufacturing and expanding the accessibility of fresh produce to communities who live in food deserts i also support the governor s foresight on redistricting the governor s redistricting plan would also impact our entire state but most importantly communities of color in the state legislature minority representation dropped significantly due to partisan gerrymandering resulting in only twelve members of color serving in the entire legislature i intend to support every measure possible that will allow wisconsinites the ability to choose their representatives instead of political patronage choosing for them in all i am confident in the governor s plans to move wisconsin forward and i am hopeful that all members of the legislature will heed the call of the people of wisconsin to put partisan politics aside and do the work of moving the needle for residents of our state sen duey stroebel r cedarburg wisconsin continues on the right path thanks to the work of legislative republicans in his speech tonight governor evers articulated a vision that may resonate in madison and milwaukee but falls well short of the values and priorities of my constituents the governor plans to spend too much tax too much and increase the size of state government at the expense of hard working wisconsinites while governor evers acknowledged the challenges facing rural wisconsin his policy proposals during his first year as governor have not aided farmers or their neighbors he proposed ending the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit a key driver of economic growth in wisconsin his proposed budget prioritized urban schools and their students over their rural peers his agencies have also pursued policies and regulations that will increase the cost for businesses throughout our state including farmers governor evers agenda will not benefit rural wisconsin or my constituents i look forward to working on behalf of my constituents to ensure that wisconsin continues on the path of prosperity and success speaker robin vos r rochester it s disappointing that governor evers would rather pose for holy pictures than actually work with the legislature his speech tonight was more about politics than anything else governor evers is finally acknowledging the needs of rural wisconsin he has basically ignored our rural areas his entire term up to this point with an agenda focused on madison and milwaukee while the governor talks about bipartisanship the legislature actually delivers on it i m proud of the bipartisan track record in the assembly with 95 percent of the votes getting bipartisan support last year we have three bipartisan speaker s task forces to address important issues in the state water quality suicide prevention and adoption instead of playing politics republicans are working hard to bring people together during the final months of the legislative session i look forward to taking up legislation to improve the state s water quality and help make communities safe through the tougher on crime package republicans will continue to block governor evers liberal agenda and ensure the state moves forward without expanding welfare overspending or overtaxing the citizens of wisconsin
by francesco canepa frankfurt reuters european central bank president christine lagarde is set to launch a broad review of its policy on thursday that is likely to see her redefine the ecb s main goal and how to achieve it the euro zone s central bank has fallen short of its inflation target of just under 2 for years despite increasingly aggressive stimulus measures under lagarde s predecessor mario draghi ecb rate setters are not expected to make any policy change this week but simply stand by their pledge to keep buying bonds and if needed cut interest rates until price growth in the euro zone heads back to their goal lagarde will however announce the start and scope of the ecb s first strategic review since 2003 which will last for most of the year and span topics from the inflation target to digital money and the fight against climate change investors will be looking for clues to whether the review will see lagarde cement her predecessor s legacy of monetary largesse or if she will use it to acknowledge worries that years of easy credit have fueled financial bubbles thursday s meeting will be important in assessing whether the aim of reconsidering the inflation target has retained the dovish motivation focus that draghi had tried to give it said greg fuzesi an economist at jp morgan the ecb will announce its monetary policy decision at 1245 gmt and lagarde will hold her second news conference as the central bank s chief from 1330 gmt the euro at 1 1083 was hovering just above a one month low against the dollar early on thursday while asian stocks tumbled on worries about the spread of a new flu like virus in china target changing the ecb s formulation of price stability currently defined as an annual inflation rate below but close to 2 over the medium term will be the focal point of the review the ecb could signal its commitment to boosting inflation by raising the goal to 2 and spelling out that it will take any undershooting just as seriously as an overshoot story continues our inflation target must be symmetric if the central target is seen as a ceiling we have less a chance of meeting it ecb policymaker francois villeroy de galhau said recently but policy hawks on the governing council who have long called for the ecb s money taps to be shut off will not go down without a fight some of them favor creating a tolerance band around 2 which would lower pressure on the ecb to act while others would leave the target unchanged or even cut it rate setters will also debate the pros and cons of their tools such as sub zero rates and massive bond purchases which have been credited with staving off the threat of deflation but at the cost of an unprecedented rise in house and bond prices the ecb regularly lauds those instruments recently estimating that without them the euro zone economy would have been 2 7 percentage points smaller at the end of 2018 but minutes of the december meeting show growing discomfort about their side effects that led to calls by some policymakers to give housing costs greater weight in inflation calculations and take into account households perceptions of price growth which is generally higher than official figures policy on hold while these matters are addressed the ecb is expected to leave its monetary policy on hold that would leave it buying 20 billion euros 22 16 billion worth of bonds every month and charging banks 0 5 on their idle cash for most of the year while the ecb reviews its strategy we see no change in policy settings economists at morgan stanley wrote in a note euro zone data has improved recently leading economists to believe the export focused economy has weathered the storms of the global trade war furthermore a trade deal between the united states and china and the prospect of an orderly brexit are lessening the two main risks the ecb had said were clouding the horizon but the outlook for euro zone growth and inflation remains lukewarm meaning the ecb is likely to strike a cautious tone by reaffirming its warning about downside risks to the economy it is likely too early to sound the all clear or change the risk assessment to balanced societe general economist anatoly annenkov said reporting by francesco canepa editing by catherine evans

bkr earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 baker hughes co bkr 0 20 q4 2019 earnings call 9 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the baker hughes company fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time as a reminder this conference call is being recorded i would now like to introduce your host for today s conference mr jud bailey vice president of investor relations sir you may begin judson bailey vice president of investor relations thank you good morning everyone and welcome to the baker hughes company fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call here with me are our chairman and ceo lorenzo simonelli and our cfo brian worrell the earnings release we issued earlier today can be found on our website at bakerhughes com as a reminder during the course of this conference call we will provide forward looking statements these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions please review our sec filings and website for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially as you know reconciliations of operating income and other non gaap to gaap measures can be found in our earnings release with that i will turn the call over to lorenzo lorenzo simonelli chairman and chief executive officer thank you jud good morning everyone and thanks for joining us we delivered a solid fourth quarter with strong orders in our turbomachinery and oilfield equipment segments solid operating performance from our tps business strong free cash flow and better execution in our digital solutions business these positives were partially offset by weaker than expected margin performance from our ofs business for the full year of 2019 we achieved a number of key milestones including 20 year over year order growth in tps almost 300 basis points of margin improvement in tps 12 order growth in ofe and free cash flow of 1 2 billion in addition we accelerated our separation efforts from ge launched our new company brand and positioned ourselves to compete more effectively in a changing marketplace i cannot thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication to achieve our goals throughout the year as we look into 2020 we see a macro environment that is slowly improving as well as a range of opportunities to further strengthen baker hughes on both the near term and long term basis in the near term we continue to identify and execute on opportunities to improve our day to day operations and cash flow efficiency in 2020 looking out on a longer term basis we see a number of attractive growth opportunities for our company and we remain focused on positioning baker hughes for the upcoming energy transition and the digital transformation of the industry this balance between near term and long term objectives can be found in each of the strategic goals that i highlighted on our last earnings call to remind you these goals are one margin improvement in our oilfield services and oilfield equipment businesses two evolving our portfolio specifically leveraging some of our unique core competencies to expand our offerings in the industrial and chemical end markets as well as improving our position for the energy transition and three continuing to expand our digital offerings to drive greater efficiency as well as safer and more reliable operations for our customers together with our ai partner c3 over the last several months we have spoken at length about our first goal of execution and operational improvement which remains an important focus for baker hughes in 2020 however today i would like to spend some time providing insight on how we are thinking about our goal of portfolio evolution and positioning for the energy transition as you know energy transition is an important topic that has gained a significant amount of momentum in the industry and the investment community over the last six to 12 months as we have stated previously baker hughes is firmly committed to playing a leading role in a lower carbon future one year ago we made our own commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and our corporate strategy remains clearly focused on being the leading energy technology company to help facilitate the energy transition as we look ahead to the next two decades there are various published forecasts on the long term demand outlook for hydrocarbons and the expected growth rate for renewable energy sources within these forecasts there are a wide range of predictions for growth or peak demand for the different types of hydrocarbons in the coming decades our view remains that in almost any scenario natural gas will be the key transition fuel and perhaps even a destination fuel for a lower carbon future as a result we believe that natural gas demand will grow at more than twice the pace of oil over the next 10 years and that lng demand growth will be higher still at an annual rate of 4 to 5 against this market backdrop we believe that baker hughes is uniquely positioned to provide technologies and solutions that help our customers lower their carbon footprint while there is strong recognition of our world class lng franchise our broad portfolio also offers a wide range of products that help customers lower their carbon footprint today and that are directly tied to the continued growth in renewable energy sources some examples of these products are well known like our lm9000 aeroderivative gas turbine which can reduce nox emissions by 40 and overall co2 equivalent emissions by up to 25 compared to alternative turbines in its class however there are broader system level uses where our tps equipment has the opportunity to be deployed in carbon reduction applications for example our core technologies in compression have the capability to help deliver carbon capture utilization and storage and we are actively marketing these solutions to customers today in one application we reconfigured our novalt gas turbine generator technology to operate 100 on hydrogen and we continue to explore opportunities in the hydrogen value chain in both transportation and production as another example our turbomachinery equipment can be used to help deliver mechanical storage of energy for use in peak demand for renewables enabling customers to store and deliver renewable sourced energy to the grid efficiently and effectively in addition we see three new technology areas emerging as part of the energy transition for which our digital solutions segment is uniquely positioned the first is emissions monitoring where our products such as lumen and avitas are directly applicable lumen is a suite of methane monitoring and inspection solutions and avitas offers smart inspection and monitoring service solutions in both land and aerial applications the second area is emissions reduction where our flare iq flare management system allows downstream operators to reduce flaring emissions by 90 the third area is condition monitoring for renewables specifically in wind turbine applications our bently nevada business within digital solutions has monitoring devices which ensure detectability of the most costly and critical drive train failure modes deployed on more than 32 000 wind turbines globally a tremendous installed base we have built over the last decade while these technologies combined represent a small percentage of baker hughes overall revenue today they are products and services that we believe have great growth potential and also provide a strong platform for future product introductions and carbon based initiatives with customers as we execute on these near term and long term strategic initiatives we are also mindful of the ever changing macro backdrop across the energy markets on this note we generally believe that macro fundamentals have slightly improved over the last few months as dynamics on both the demand and supply side have become more positive with that said our incrementally positive view of the macro environment is tempered by growing geopolitical risk most notably in the middle east on the demand side the outlook for oil and gas has modestly improved with the recent phase 1 trade deal the slight improvement in pmis for key economies and continued positive economic data out of the us we believe that these variables should be supportive of a firm oil demand outlook in 2020 and one in which our customers will continue to execute their budget plans and advance important projects on the supply side the outlook has also firmed with another recent round of opec production cuts and more signs of slowing us production growth importantly we believe the continuation of solid demand growth combined with the growing commitment to e p capital discipline helps support a more constructive macro outlook further we believe the continuation of these trends could begin to reduce excess crude inventory by later this year or into 2021 and support multiple years of growth internationally although the macro environment appears to be improving our overall outlook for our ofs and ofe segments remain largely unchanged from the framework we outlined on our third quarter earnings call for our ofs segment we now believe that north america d c spend in 2020 is trending toward a low double digit decline rate versus 2019 this view is based on early e p budget announcements and the lower exit rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 we continue to believe that our differentiated ofs portfolio will provide somewhat of a buffer to the challenges in the north american market internationally our expectations remain mid single digit growth but with a slight bias to the upside driven primarily by an improving pipeline of opportunities in the ofe segment our outlook is for the subsea tree market to remain stable around 300 trees in 2020 we expect to maintain our position in the subsea market driven by strong execution for customers and continued traction with our subsea connect strategy for tps while we do not expect the exceptionally strong year for lng fids in 2019 to repeat in 2020 our outlook for this segment remains constructive as we execute the largest backlog in the company s history and expect continued growth in services and non lng equipment awards for the lng portion of our tps segment our outlook remains constructive despite some softness in near term spot prices conversations with our customers have not changed materially if spot price weakness persists we would expect this to shift the balance for future fids toward more economically advantaged brownfield projects in the 2021 to 2025 time frame we were pleased to see around 90 mtpa of lng fids between the fourth quarter of 2018 and the end of 2019 while just short of the 100 mtpa we thought the industry could fid in this period we believe that fid activity in 2020 should remain solid and at least in line with the average annual fid levels witnessed in the prior cycle between 2011 and 2015 in our digital solutions segment we continue to believe global gdp growth is the most relevant metric by which to forecast this business given the variety of end markets it serves the oil and gas market drives approximately 50 of ds revenue with 20 coming from the power market and the balance from a number of industries including aerospace automation consumer electronics and other industrials with over 90 of ds revenue coming from hardware and associated software solutions across a range of brands such as bently nevada nexus controls druck panametrics and reuter stokes this is a mature stable business with the best in class measurement sensing and inspection technology in summary we delivered a solid fourth quarter and full year 2019 we are clearly focused on executing our strategy and generating strong free cash flow improving margins and driving returns with that let me turn the call over to brian brian worrell chief financial officer thanks lorenzo i will begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details orders for the quarter were 6 9 billion up 1 year over year and down 11 sequentially the year over year growth was driven by strong orders in oilfield equipment sequentially the decrease was driven by turbomachinery which booked a very large lng order in the third quarter remaining performance obligation was 22 9 billion up 3 sequentially equipment rpo ended at 8 1 billion up 10 sequentially and services rpo ended at 14 8 billion our total company book to bill ratio in the quarter was 1 1 and our equipment book to bill in the quarter was 1 2 revenue for the quarter was 6 3 billion up 8 sequentially driven by turbomachinery digital solutions and oilfield equipment offset by oilfield services year over year revenue was up 1 driven by ofs and ofe offset by declines in tps and ds operating income for the quarter was 331 million which is up 11 sequentially and down 13 year over year adjusted operating income was 546 million which excludes 216 million of restructuring separation and other charges we incurred 135 million of new restructuring charges in our ofs business during the quarter as we continue to work through a new phase of cost out and productivity initiatives these are primarily focused on supply chain optimization improving asset utilization and driving down product and service delivery costs separation and merger related charges in the quarter were 57 million adjusted operating income was up 30 sequentially and up 10 year over year our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 8 6 up 140 basis points sequentially and up 70 basis points year over year corporate costs were 118 million in the quarter which is modestly higher than third quarter levels and our initial expectations a few months ago we expect the corporate line to increase slightly from this level in 2020 as we continue to accelerate our separation efforts i will go into more detail on these costs in a moment depreciation and amortization was 354 million down sequentially and flat year over year we expect depreciation and amortization to remain around this level in the first quarter of 2020 tax expense for the quarter was 212 million which was higher than expected driven by the geographic mix of earnings and certain year end provisions gaap earnings per share were 0 07 down 0 03 sequentially and down 0 21 year over year adjusted earnings per share were 0 27 up 0 06 sequentially and up 0 01 year over year free cash flow in the quarter was 1 1 billion which was above our expectations we delivered 639 million from working capital driven by strong collections and inventory management in ofs as well as progress collections in tps and ofe overall we are very pleased with the cash performance in the fourth quarter as ofs saw improvements after the shortfall in the third quarter we continue to see improvement in our working capital processes and are focused on optimizing our cash operations to ensure we deliver on our free cash flow conversion target when i look at the total year 2019 i am pleased with our financial results which reflect our consistent execution on the priorities we set out at the beginning of the year orders for the full year were up 13 in 2019 driven by 20 order growth in tps and 12 order growth in ofe tps book to bill was 1 4 in the year and ofe book to bill was 1 2 full year revenue was up 4 our ofs and ofe businesses were both up 11 offset by declines in tps and ds despite a challenging macro environment for the broader energy market we were able to grow total company adjusted operating income margins by 60 basis points we drove margins higher in three of our four segments with improvements of 270 basis points in tps 190 basis points in ofe and 40 basis points in ofs offset by a 120 basis point decline in ds overall the results for each of our product companies are in line with the framework we outlined at the beginning of the year corporate costs for the year were 433 million as i mentioned we expect to incur an additional 50 million to 60 million of corporate costs in 2020 related to the ramp up in separation efforts we have a significant number of transition services agreements in place with ge across a range of functions including it hr treasury and other infrastructure to ensure we maintain the continuity of our business operations importantly we expect these incremental costs to recede in 2021 as we roll off the transition services agreements and utilize our own systems in conjunction with the separation activities we are also taking the opportunity to upgrade our systems and sunset some aging processes and infrastructure to ensure baker hughes is best positioned to drive further efficiencies in our operations which should lead to higher margins we generated 1 2 billion of free cash flow in 2019 we were very pleased with our cash performance in the year and continue to improve our working capital metrics we invested 976 million in net capital expenditures in 2019 and we expect to see similar net capex levels in 2020 included in our 2019 free cash flow results are 307 million of restructuring separation and merger related cash outflows as we have outlined we expect restructuring related outflows to decline in 2020 offset by an increase in separation related cash outflows given the strong level of free cash flow generated in 2019 we ended the year with 3 2 billion of cash on hand and net debt of 3 4 billion after returning 1 billion of cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends we continue to see our balance sheet as a key strength and differentiator in this cyclical industry now i will walk through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward in oilfield services the team continues to navigate a challenging environment in north america while driving strong growth internationally ofs revenue in the quarter was 3 3 billion which was down 2 sequentially north american revenue was down 11 sequentially driven by declining rig count and weaker completions in us land as well as a double digit sequential decline in our gulf of mexico operations international revenue was up 4 sequentially driven by continued growth in the middle east asia pacific and latin america operating income in the quarter was 235 million down 14 sequentially and margins declined 110 basis points ofs margins were below our expectations primarily due to weaker north american results and lower product sales than originally planned despite coming in slightly below our expectations we believe the margin headwinds in the fourth quarter are largely transitory and our expectations for 2020 are unchanged as we look at 2020 for our ofs segment we expect international spending to increase in the mid single digit range with most of the growth coming from a number of offshore markets and regional strength in the middle east north sea and parts of latin america given our focus on execution and improving margins i would expect our international ofs business to generally track in line with industry trends in north america we expect us d c spend to decline low double digits versus 2019 as domestic e ps continue to restrain spending to generate more free cash flow similar to 2019 we would expect revenue for our north american ofs business to outperform industry spending trends given our production weighted mix for margins we expect to deliver year over year growth driven primarily by our cost out and productivity enhancement actions i will also reiterate that over time our goal remains to close the margin gap with peers as we look ahead to the first quarter we expect north america to get off to a relatively slow start and expect typical seasonal trends in key eastern hemisphere markets like the north sea and russia as a result we expect total ofs revenue to experience a modest sequential decline and for margins to decline slightly but still remain well above year ago margin levels next i will cover oilfield equipment orders in the quarter were 1 1 billion up 6 year over year driven by growth in both equipment and service orders equipment book to bill in ofe was 1 7 we booked several key awards in the quarter totaling 22 trees which brings our 2019 total to 73 trees with this level of awards we maintained a similar position in the market as in 2018 revenue was 765 million up 5 year over year this increase was primarily driven by better subsea services activity and subsea production systems volumes partially offset by lower revenues in flexibles operating income was 16 million up 28 year over year driven by increased volume in sps operating margins were up 20 basis points sequentially and up 40 basis points year over year as we look at our ofe segment in 2020 we believe that offshore market fundamentals should support another solid year of orders with subsea tree awards expected to remain relatively consistent with 2019 for 2020 we believe that ofe should see revenue growth in the high single digit range following two years of strong orders growth we expect volume growth in sps and improving mix from flexibles to drive solid margin improvement in ofe in 2020 for the first quarter we expect the trend of year over year revenue growth to continue as we execute on the positive momentum from our sps and flexibles product lines based on our anticipated project conversion schedule we expect ofe revenues to increase in the mid single digit range on a year over year basis along with modest margin improvement moving to turbomachinery orders in the quarter were 1 9 billion down 10 year over year equipment orders were down 16 year over year and equipment book to bill was 1 5 during the quarter we booked an award for the liquefaction equipment on total s mozambique area 1 lng project and we had some important wins in onshore offshore production including two fpso awards in latin america service orders in the quarter were down 4 year over year mainly driven by lower contractual services offset by higher transactional services and upgrades revenue for the quarter was 1 6 billion down 8 versus the prior year for the quarter services revenue was down 2 versus the prior year and equipment revenue was down 18 driven primarily by business dispositions operating income for tps was 305 million up 19 year over year driven by higher services mix and cost productivity operating margin was 18 7 up 430 basis points year over year and up 520 basis points sequentially overall tps results for the quarter came in slightly above our expectations with a much stronger margin rate offsetting revenue that was below our expectations while the supply chain issues that impacted the third quarter lingered into the fourth quarter the primary driver behind the lower than expected revenue was slower conversion of our equipment backlog than we anticipated rod and the team have done a very good job of managing costs and execution as they work to deliver on the largest lng equipment backlog in tps s history the 2020 outlook we provided for tps last quarter remains largely similar given the consecutive years of strong order growth in 2018 and 2019 we expect year over year revenue growth of roughly 20 and for margins to continue to expand i would note however that our current expectation for revenue conversion is weighted more toward the second half of the year based on project timing for orders we still believe that tps could be flat to down low double digits compared to 2019 levels as you know timing on large projects can vary which drives a wide range of scenarios as we think about the first quarter we expect tps revenues to be roughly flat with first quarter 2019 levels given the equipment conversion schedules that i previously mentioned on the margin front we expect to show solid improvement on a year over year basis finally on digital solutions orders for the quarter were 645 million down 4 year over year growth in our controls and inspection businesses was partially offset by declines in measurement sensing and pipeline process solutions regionally we saw strong orders growth in asia and the middle east offset by declines in the other regions revenue for the quarter was 659 million down 5 year over year primarily due to the sale of the digital apm product line excluding the impact of this disposition revenue was down slightly with growth in bently nevada inspection and measurement sensing offset by declines in controls and pipeline process solutions operating income for the quarter was 109 million down 5 year over year driven by lower volume despite the decline in year over year revenue we delivered on productivity and cost out to hold the margin rate flat versus the fourth quarter of 2018 looking ahead to the full year 2020 for ds we continue to expect revenue growth in the low single digits and modestly higher margins this outlook takes into account a gdp plus growth rate but anticipates that ds is likely to see some continued softness in the power business revenue growth will also be impacted as we pivot our software strategy with the sale of the digital apm offering and work closely with our ai partner c3 on new opportunities for the first quarter we expect revenue to decline in the mid single digits year over year and for margins to decline modestly due to the non repeat of a large project in the first quarter of 2019 in closing we delivered a strong fourth quarter finishing at a solid 2019 for baker hughes as we look forward to 2020 we are clearly focused on executing our strategy and generating strong free cash flow improving margins and driving returns with that i will turn the call back over to jud judson bailey vice president of investor relations thank you operator let s open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from james west with evercore isi james west evercore isi analyst hey good morning gentlemen lorenzo simonelli chairman and chief executive officer hi james james west evercore isi analyst so lorenzo you guys are clear leaders in the energy transition here and i wanted to maybe talk a little bit higher level about the various buckets you re attacking i mean clearly natural gas is a big part of the strategy and you have some leading products there you also have your own internal esg plans and goals many of which you ve been highlighting over the last year but then you also have products and services that hit all parts of the carbon chain whether that s monitoring and then carbon capture so how do you think about i mean if i bucket those into those three if that s the way you think about it if not please let me know but how do you think about which ones do you want to allocate more capital to less capital to which are the bigger growth drivers maybe in the intermediate term for baker and i guess what is your overall strategy lorenzo simonelli chairman and chief executive officer yeah james thanks and as you know the energy transition and the theme of energy transition has gained a lot of attention over the course of the last 12 months a year ago you ll recall that we actually made our commitment relative to reducing our own carbon footprint 50 by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 and as you look at baker hughes we are really playing a critical role at the energy transition across a number of areas given our broad portfolio and i highlighted some of those in script that was prepared but if you look at some of the key areas the first i d say is as you look at natural gas and you look at lng clearly for the energy transition and reducing the amount of co2 there is going to be an increasing use of natural gas as a transition but also destination target and we see that lng is going to continue to grow over the next few decades even as renewables grows as well and that s a key focus for us with the introduction that we ve made at the lm9000 also our fast application of the novelty which is hydrogen based so clearly a shift toward on the rotating equipment side helping in the energy transition beyond that as you look also the digital solutions platform clearly with what we have as lumen and also avitas these are solutions that enable our customers to monitor and also understand how they can reduce their carbon footprint so you look at our broad portfolio we re uniquely positioned and that s why we say from a standpoint of moving energy forward and also being an energy technology company we re going to be helping our customers and partners through this energy transition brian worrell chief financial officer yeah james if you look at how we re allocating capital clearly we re continuing to invest in tps which is having an impact today we ve got lots of opportunities and adjacencies in tps we can put a little bit of capital to work either through technology development or some partnerships and can grow our footprint there and then digital solutions it s a high margin business we get good returns we ll continue to invest capital there so i think you ll see us balance the capital allocation with short term and then long term as we continue to pivot the portfolio as part of energy transition so we ll update you if there are any changes there but i think we ve got a pretty good approach right now to drive short term growth and margins as well as position the portfolio for the long term james west evercore isi analyst yeah totally agree and then maybe a follow up on the lng pricing issue short term pricing weakness has impacted perception of the lng liquefaction build out story but it seems to me that were two things one that it hasn t really changed the conversations on the better capitalized projects and number two lower prices now probably with even better demand in the future for lng are those fair statements that are making and do you agree that it s not going to cause any real weakness in the kind of build out cycle beyond the i know we want the same record year we saw last year but that we re pretty much full steam ahead lorenzo simonelli chairman and chief executive officer yeah james you re looking at it the right way if you look at recent lng spot price weakness it doesn t change the overall long term lng demand and supply dynamics and in fact the conversations we re having with our customers are really toward the continued demand for lng over the long term and if you take a step back you look at where we re going to be by 2030 it s going to be between 550 million tons to 600 million tons of demand and to produce that you re going to need 700 million tons of installed capacity so even with where we are today with the construction of 60 mtpa and also the 90 that was fid last year you ve still got another 130 to 150 that s got to go in the next coming years so we feel good about the lng space and we feel good about the long term aspect of it operator thank you our next question comes from angie sedita with goldman sachs angie sedita goldman sachs group inc analyst good morning guys lorenzo simonelli chairman and chief executive officer hi angie brian worrell chief financial officer hi angie angie sedita goldman sachs group inc analyst hi so i appreciate the details brian on the revenue side when we think about 2020 in q1 but if we could drill down a little bit on the margin side thoughts around oilfield service margins in 2020 i know you re not where you really want to be but how much self help you think you could have going into the year for 2020 and when do you think we could start to see some parity versus your peers brian worrell chief financial officer yeah angie look we did see margins below where we wanted them to be in the fourth quarter and there wasn t really one thing that i can point to that say it was the main driver there were a couple of things going on that impact of the margin rate i d say first as we saw slightly lower than anticipated activity in the us land market for us which we think was really largely customer and basin specific we also saw as we went into the end of the year some weakness in our gulf of mexico operations which obviously carries higher margin rates for obvious reasons there and then lastly i d say our product sales were lower than we anticipated we knew they were going to be lower because if you remember we had a very strong third quarter as we accelerated some of those product deliveries to meet customer demand and we did have some of those slip out of the quarter so those three things combined put pressure on the margin rate versus what we expected but you know based on what i m seeing today they re largely transitory in nature and i don t see them impacting us as we roll into 2020 and if i look at 2020 we expect a large portion of that margin improvement to as you say be self help with cost out and productivity initiatives that we re driving and you saw we posted some restructuring reserves in the quarter as we had very specific programs in supply chain and service delivery across maria claudia portfolio to help drive the margin rate improvement and i d say that the other thing that supports margin rate improvement in 2020 is we re really getting to the maturation phase of some of the larger integrated contracts internationally where we saw some ramp up cost this year and we ve come up the learning curve so i can see strong margin improvement in those contracts so that should certainly help the overall margin rate and if i look at the overall cost out and productivity initiatives they are really in two buckets angie one is around efficiency and operations optimization and the other is around product costs so for instance around product costs we ve been working for quite some time with the engineering and product teams to identify specific areas where we can go in and drive cost out some of that is target costing some of it s looking at a broader supply base and some of it s looking at overheads to see how we can leverage overheads globally more efficiently on the efficiency and productivity side we re looking at a lot of opportunities to cross train individuals to make sure you don t have to send multiple people who were going to have idle time when they re out on a rig and it s taken us some time to really get through those details and understand how to attack that but with what we put up in restructuring in the quarter the plans we have in place we feel good about our ability to continue to grow margins in 2020 in ofs so our framework is really unchanged and maria claudia and the team as well as the whole enterprise are focused on getting those margin rates up angie sedita goldman sachs group inc analyst thanks that s very helpful brian i appreciate that so maybe you can do the same thing around tps given the strong backlog you already had in hand thoughts around margins for 2020 i think you ve said in the past maybe low to mid teens is that still a fair assumption and do you think ultimately that the high teens is where you would consider your run rate brian worrell chief financial officer yeah angie i am very pleased with how rod and the team have closed out the year and are managing customer expectations with its incredibly large backlog and balancing cost and returns as they go through so pleased with where they are today look our outlook for 2020 margins again is largely unchanged from what we talked about in the last call and just to remind you there are a few dynamics that come into play that really impact how much margin accretion we will have in the year first we expect contractual services and transactional services to grow in 2020 which is accretive to margins you mentioned the large backlog the largest in our history we will see more lng equipment revenue come through in 2020 while that is accretive to overall equipment margin it does have a negative mix effect as we talked about for the total business and then we are in the early stages of executing on the two very large lng projects arctic 2 and vg which tend to have their lowest margin point at the beginning of the execution and you start to see that accrete over time so that will have an impact here and then you know we ve talked a bit about the technology spend in tps and we said we were evaluating that and back actually to james s earlier question we see a lot of opportunity in energy transition to continue to grow this franchise and strengthen its position in the marketplace so i d expect technology spend to be roughly where it is this year so if you add all that up i d say that the more revenue we have the faster it grows it impacts the magnitude of the upside in margins and you saw that come through in the dynamics of the third and fourth quarter and how strong our services was versus the equipment but overall goal is to continue to drive margin enhancement in the business and over time we do see mid to high teens as revenue normalizes in the portfolio and services continue to grow and with the large equipment backlog we have now especially in lng you ll start to see that services backlog grow over time as we sign customers up for long term service agreement so largely unchanged tailwinds in the business and i think rod and the team are doing a great job managing through that operator thanks your next question comes from chase mulvehill with bank of america merrill lynch chase mulvehill bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning i guess i wanted to come back to the tps service commentary earlier you talked about the largest lng backlog in the history and you ve kind of touched on some of the digital things that you re doing could you talk a little bit about the opportunities that you have on this the lng service side with this significant backlog and then what digital ultimately means for the tps or the lng service business and potentially maybe some shift over to the contractual side of the services business brian worrell chief financial officer yeah chase look i m very happy with how the services business is performing in tps and on a reported basis for the year the service revenue was flattish slightly down when you take into account some of the dispositions that we had as well as the impact of fx for the total year revenue actually was up mid single digits operationally so performing pretty much in line with how you would expect this portfolio to perform and this year it represented about 60 of tps s revenue and that will obviously change over time as the equipment starts to convert and as you pointed out contractual services is a big piece of that as are our transactional services that contractual services backlog is about 13 billion today and we expect that to continue to grow and just to round out services we do have installation and upgrades including there as well as some services on pumps and valves but the large majority are contractual services if i take a look at the transactional piece we had growth in 2019 in mid single digits i would expect that to continue into 2020 and from a digital standpoint lots of opportunities in the services portfolio one internally to help us operate better and use our partnership with c3 we ve got tons of data on this equipment and how we operate in the field we think that c3 can help us unlock even more internal productivity as we execute on these service contracts and provide transactional services and upgrade and in addition there are opportunities to introduce some of this in to these contractual services to help the customers equipment performed better and then there is lots of things we can do with the data that we have from things that aren t on contractual services and put together offerings forecasts customers to help drive better productivity and better up time for the equipment so i think it s an untapped opportunity right now we re not counting on a lot of that as we roll into 2020 we ll be working a lot with c3 and our teams and i would expect to see some of those digital things kick in the outer years to have a meaningful impact on revenue chase mulvehill bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks very good lorenzo simonelli chairman and chief executive officer chase just maybe to add if you look at on the digital side and the c3 partnership we ve actually launched already two solutions into the marketplace one around reliability which really targets the up time for the equipment and that can be applied to the service agreements and drive efficiency and productivity and then also optimization and so really as we look at the next few years digital is a key area of focus and it s going to drive a lot of efficiencies chase mulvehill bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it understood thank you one real quick follow up obviously you ve got the ge offering overhanging out there still could you talk to how much baker hughes would look to repurchase alongside an offering should we think of it kind of free cash flow after dividends for 2020 or would you actually add a little bit of leverage to take down a little bit more stock brian worrell chief financial officer yeah chase i d say that look our overall capital allocation and corporate finance policy it really hasn t changed from what we talked about in terms of commitments turned 40 to 50 of net to shareholders through dividends and buyback and i think as you and i ve talked before we will certainly evaluate any potential offerings by ge and put that into our thinking as we allocate capital over the course of the year so no real change there in terms of how we re thinking about it and you should assume that we re certainly taking that into account as we look at our free cash flow and all of our metrics for the year operator thank you our next question comes from david anderson with barclays david anderson barclays capital inc analyst hi good morning i was hoping to dig into a little bit in your chemicals business here which is getting some more attention lately with your biggest competitor changing hands i was wondering if you just talk about the business mix and what you see as the primary growth drivers in next several years in terms of offshore onshore now in downstream which is not really a market we hear much about you highlighted a big contract with valero today could you just kind of talk about that business and how you see that developing lorenzo simonelli chairman and chief executive officer yeah dave if you look at our chemical franchise and again we ve mentioned it before that we think it s a great area that we ve been in on the upstream side and actually got a good footprint in north america and we ve actually allocated capital to increase our presence internationally if you look at our expansion in singapore facility as well as in the kingdom of saudi arabia and i think actually the m a activity you just mentioned validates a lot of the approach that we ve had we ve got an increasing usage of chemicals when you look at enhanced oil recovery you ve also got an opportunity on the downstream side as you mentioned which we ve got an opportunity to grow in and when you look at the specialty chemicals that we provide and its application it s increasing across both the upstream and downstream so we feel good about the strategy we got in place and also the growth trajectory for this chemicals business over time brian worrell chief financial officer yeah and dave if i look at where we are today we re predominantly north america we do have an international presence but with the investments we re making in singapore and saudi to shift capacity we see more growth coming for us internationally and today we re mostly upstream we do have some downstream and i think there is a lot of growth opportunities for us in downstream as well and the other thing i d point out about the investments that we re making the singapore investment is really going to reduce our cost base better manufacturing better supply chain cost better logistics cost and then what we re doing in saudi is really size for the region to allow us to be very responsive to a lot of very large customers in that region so again we like the space we re putting capital to work there and we would expect to see growth and margin accretion in chemicals david anderson barclays capital inc analyst yeah i was going to say and presumably this is rather accretive to your ofs business i would assume correct brian worrell chief financial officer yeah we like this business yes david anderson barclays capital inc analyst okay and maybe just on a different subject i just want to ask about kind of your ofs business mix in north america and just kind of how you feel about kind of where you are whether or not you re satisfied out there and there s been some reports out there that potentially you may be looking to exit the lufkin rod lift business i would have thought that would be kind of part of your longer term strategy you talked about more of the production side but maybe this is more capital intensive than you like i was just wondering maybe if you could comment on that and perhaps more broadly on your north american mix in terms of where you want to be brian worrell chief financial officer yeah dave i think we talked about the portfolio before and i have basically said that we want to focus the company in areas that are highly differentiated we have seen the less fragmentation that allow us to generate higher returns and look as we look at the energy transition and how we expect that to unfold if there are areas that don t meet that criteria we would potentially look to generate cash by not having those in the portfolio and redeploying that cash in the areas where we can get higher returns over the short term in the end and or a better fit long term within the portfolio so i d say look the north american market has changed quite a bit over the last few years and there are some areas where we think the technology or the fragmentation are going to make it harder to get returns that justify them being inside the portfolio and we ll continue to look at that but nothing right now that i need to update you on in terms of things that are changing and as we have news we ll certainly let you know but i want you to understand we are focused on returns here and where we deploy this incremental capital dollars and i think the market has changed quite a bit and where we re relooking some things operator thank you your next question comes from sean meakim with jpmorgan sean meakim jpmorgan chase analyst hey good morning brian worrell chief financial officer hey sean lorenzo simonelli chairman and chief executive officer hey sean sean meakim jpmorgan chase analyst so you ve good free cash in the quarter typical seasonality and maybe some catch up from 3q in ofs like you mentioned of the 600 million on working capital benefit how much would you attribute to just typical seasonal collections versus progress payments from the new projects coming in and we re sticking maybe with perhaps a peak order cycle in 19 we ll see can you maybe just talk about how the cash flow profile looks over the course of the typical tps project and how that should influence expectations for free cash in 20 and 21 as you start to convert these projects brian worrell chief financial officer yeah so i would say we did have typical seasonality and i think the majority of what we saw in the quarter was related to that typical seasonality as we talked about on the third quarter call ofs came in below expectations and they really turned the corner here in the fourth quarter by making up on some of that and it was really driven by strong collection process overall and that s all the way from billing on time following up getting the collection thing and the team did a really good job of managing inventory inputs as we had been making a lot of process changes over the course of the year and that came through we did have some benefit from progress collections in tps and ofe but i think you have to look at it in totality it s a small piece but progress is only one piece of the equation because at the same time you re getting down payments or you re getting progress collections as you re executing on the project you are also bringing in inventory as well so it s not a one for one follow through in terms of free cash flow you have to look at more accounts on the balance sheet and in tps typically you start out with a down payment we have long lead items that you bring into the project and then based on certain milestones you build a customer and you collect so one of the first things i look at in any tps project is the cash curve to see what our cash position looks like in that and our goal is to have them be favorable from a cash flow standpoint so you will see ebbs and flows and progress collections over the lifecycle of a project in receivables and inventory but i would say it was a small impact here in the fourth quarter as i go into 2020 and look at how i think it will play out we should see smaller impact from progress payment and we saw in 2019 but do believe that the improvements we ve been driving in working capital processes across the franchise not just in ofs should help offset that the other thing i would say is we expect capex net capex to be roughly flat from a dollar standpoint but down as a percentage of sales is obviously we see more growth in tps and ofe and in the round out free cash flow in total sean we do expect restructuring cash outlay to be down significantly but the separation cash outlay will offset that so net net we see good dynamics as we go into 2020 for free cash flow strength sean meakim jpmorgan chase analyst got it thank you for that brian so maybe just come back to margin progression in tps so you ve got strong revenue growth this year you ve topped up your guidance today versus last quarter i think that makes sense we have somewhat limited historicals from last cycle so it s not much of a track record in terms of incremental margins and i think earlier in the call you talked about at a high level the impact between fixed cost absorption versus services versus equipment mix just as we roll all that together in terms of the flow through to year over year incremental margins how do you think about that on a normalized basis brian worrell chief financial officer yeah look as i said it really depends on how quickly revenue grows on the equipment side as to what the the absolute margin percentage increase will be but under all the scenarios that i see today we do see some margin accretion in tps i will note that based on the customer requested delivery schedules and the way the projects we re executing we do see the second half being much heavier from an equipment standpoint and an overall revenue standpoint so we would expect the second half to be much larger from a revenue standpoint and that obviously has an impact on the fixed cost absorption as you look at more revenue in the first half so look we ll continue to update you throughout the year if that changes but right now that s how i see things playing out operator thank you our next question comes from bill herbert with simmons william herbert simmons company international analyst thanks good morning so back to cash flow and free cash flow brian just very quickly one do you expect working capital to be a cash generator or a cash consumer in 2020 and secondly remind us what your free cash flow conversion target is i think it s like 90 of net income and if that s the case it seems like you re going to crush that again so could you update us on both of those please thank you brian worrell chief financial officer okay bill yeah so if i look at the free cash flow conversion target it is 90 of net income over time and i think you re going to have some years based on the projects business and how we re driving working capital where you can exceed that in some years where it could be below that based on mix of business so 90 is the through the cycle goal and if i look at overall working capital with the dynamics we talked about earlier the strong progress payments in 2019 again not quite as strong in 2020 but will have some offsets with the other working capital processes that we re driving i mean you could see a year where working capital is a slight usage based on those dynamics and the growth that we have in the portfolio but you should expect our working capital metrics to continue to improve william herbert simmons company international analyst thank you operator our next question comes from scott gruber with citigroup scott gruber citigroup analyst yes good morning brian worrell chief financial officer hey scott scott gruber citigroup analyst just a couple of detailed ones here what was the profitability split between the north american ofs business and international business in 4q and is that spread pretty similar to what you re looking for in 1q and then it sounds like you believe that the gulf activity slump which impacted 4q is transitory does that snap back in 1q is that in your guide or is that more of a 2q event brian worrell chief financial officer yeah scott we do see some improvement in 1q in the gulf i don t know that i call it a snap back but we do see improvement there and obviously that has a positive impact on margin rate as i said for obvious reasons so look frac boats were down in 4q which is a big driver of that and we do expect that to come back as far as the profitability look we don t disclose profitability by region there but i would say from a dynamic standpoint we continue to expect to see the softness in north america and feel pretty good about the growth opportunities that we re seeing in international and the thing that i would remind you of that i think i mentioned in when i talked to angie is that a lot of these large integrated projects were up the learning curve there and we should see margin accretion in 2020 as we execute on those projects and a lot of those start up costs as well as just getting to know the field costs have abated so feel pretty good about the margin progression internationally and the growth backdrop there scott gruber citigroup analyst got it and then just coming back to the chemicals business it sounds like the growth investments there will be beneficial to your overall ofs mix and return profile are you able to provide any color on the magnitude of the new plants relative to the size of your current chemicals business just trying to think about the impact of those the petrolite as they come on and when do they come on in the years ahead lorenzo simonelli chairman and chief executive officer look from a timing perspective again these plants are in construction so you won t see anything in 2020 they ll start going into a commissioning phase and more in 2021 as we mentioned we see international growth opportunities so stay tuned we ll give more updates as we start completing the plants brian worrell chief financial officer yeah and again i just reiterate here it s not all going to be incremental capacity we are shifting capacity here and again the singapore facility is going to be very cost advantage so in addition to growing internationally we ll have the benefits of higher margin rates for product that s coming out of singapore and look as we get closer to commissioning and things firm up we ll give you guys some insights into how we re thinking about that but i m spending a lot of time there and again like i said we like this business and like the capital we re putting to work there operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today s q a portion of the conference i d like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks lorenzo simonelli chairman and chief executive officer just thanks again for joining us we closed out a strong 2019 you saw the fourth quarter results and we feel that the macro environment is improving as we look at 2020 and feel good about our outlook thanks operator duration 60 minutes call

president donald trump s much discussed phase one trade deal with china sets aside some of the economic uncertainty that has generated market volatility and depressed business investment but trade experts say it falls far short of justifying a globally damaging trade war between the world s two largest economies what s more this resolution could mean higher costs for u s companies and consumers while threatened tariffs on finished consumer goods such as clothes and electronics were avoided the deal also reaffirmed the white house s commitment to tariffs as an enforcement mechanism leaving in place sanctions on 370 billion worth of chinese imports for the foreseeable future this gives american buyers of those goods primarily parts for items made in the u s a greater degree of certainty in their input costs albeit not in the direction they wanted trade analysts said this means companies facing higher input costs would probably begin passing those along to consumers in the form of higher prices if they had not done so already as tariffs become semi permanent chinese producers and u s retailers will have even more reason to pass on price increases said peter petri a professor of international finance at the brandeis international business school overall petri called the deal signed wednesday a valuable agreement saying this is a fragile truce but it s an opportunity for confidence building but he also added several caveats it stopped the downward spiral of retaliations but it is less than what its supporters claim he said some of its provisions are vague and some are unachievable other experts were less impressed i m just underwhelmed said michael o moore professor of economics and international affairs at george washington university i think most people will give a sigh of relief that it s not going to get worse but the real issues remain some said the white house gained nothing by blowing up a nearly completed agreement last spring compared to the may 2019 deal is much thinner and does not entail a long list requirements for china to change its domestic laws and regulations said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics the trump administration made much of the agricultural purchase concessions in the deal but while the consensus was that the u s agricultural sector will likely be a key beneficiary experts were skeptical that china could or would meet the target of importing an additional 200 billion worth of american goods and services including an additional 80 billion in agricultural purchases over two years above pre trade war levels this requires a 40 percent increase this year and another 40 percent increase in 2021 that seems like a stretch goal said david dollar a senior fellow at the brookings institution it s redistributing income from one group of firms to another one in a very complex way it s not obvious it s a benefit for the u s economy he said with no specific dollar targets per agricultural commodity farmers won t know how many soybeans to plant or pigs to raise making them potentially unable to fulfill much larger orders and petri pointed out that the deal s verbiage gives china wiggle room chinese officials say that they will buy u s goods based on market demand but demand won t grow that fast on its own he said to get such spectacular growth china would have to create massive subsidies for u s goods a huge government intervention that we should not be asking for petri said creating government sanctioned demand at that scale could raise the price of those goods and distort the market some said china also risked running afoul of world trade organization regulations against countries playing favorites with their trading partners in short what was a large and steadily growing market for u s commodity producers in china has now become and will remain highly politicized and hence risky for u s farmers kirkegaard said purchase guarantees weren t deemed the only questionable part of the deal provisions meant to hold china accountable for infractions such as forced technology transfers were anemic according to people who analyzed the text on trade secrets to be honest the language that s in the agreement is pretty loose and generic said harry g broadman managing director at berkeley research group who chairs the firm s emerging markets practice on the face of it i don t see at least on that portion of the agreement a lot that s significantly different from previous types of agreements some of the practices and changes agreed to by beijing were changes that were already in the works or had been previously agreed upon petri said some of these provisions will benefit both american and chinese interests and are in keeping with beijing s longer term economic goals china wants foreign investment and may well roll out new reforms in opening insurance and other financial sectors he said china is trying to create more of an environment in which investment innovation are self reinforcing processes said dean a pinkert senior counsel at the law firm of hughes hubbard reed and a former commissioner of the u s international trade commission pinkert suggested beijing s concessions in these areas were what chinese policymakers wanted anyway i think in the long run it s as much in china s interests to address those structural reform issues as much as it s in the u s s interests he said many criticized the dispute resolution provisions for not including a mechanism for third party arbitration and worried that enforcement ultimately would hinge on the threat to reinstate or ratchet up tariffs while china certainly seeks to mitigate the impact its own economy has sustained as a result of two years worth of trade sanctions the administration s choice to lean into tariffs risks inflicting more damage on the american economy as well the people who are paying the tariffs are u s firms and u s consumers

eur usd remains under pressure as tensions mount ahead of the all important ecb decision fears of the coronavirus disease are boosting the dollar thursday s four hour chart is pointing to further falls for the currency pair giving a green light to euro bulls the european central bank is set to leave its policy unchanged but may acknowledge the recent green shoots and also add green considerations to its policymaking that could unleash the upside but it all depends on president christine lagarde the relatively new head of the frankfurt based institution received a comfortable legacy mario draghi her predecessor cut rates and restarted the bond buying program in september 2019 amid worsening conditions and rising sino american tensions since then the world s largest economies signed a trade deal and recent economic figures including inflation that the ecb targets have improved acknowledging the better mood may push eur usd higher these recent encouraging statistics allow lagarde to remain above the internal battle between the doves and the hawks and be in her own words a wise owl without any imminent policy changes on the agenda she may shed light on the bank s strategic review and a different way to target inflation one of the options is to let consumer prices catch up and run quickly compensating for previous years that could send the euro tumbling down however the chances of allowing higher inflation are slim amid opposition from german members another topic that is high on the agenda is the climate crisis recent natural disasters and growing demand for action have not been on lost on the ecb lagarde may provide some details about how monetary policy rather than government action could support green causes any cooperation between the central banks and governments to spur investment could turn positive for the common currency more ecb preview glass half green or a lagarde drag on eur usd three scenarios beyond the ecb the coronavirus outbreak continues gripping headlines as the death toll from the sars like respiratory disease is rising chinese authorities decided to shut down transport links to wuhan a provincial capital that is home to 11 million people the dramatic decision coming just before the lunar new year has been weighing on markets the safe haven us dollar and yen have benefitted from the decision the world health organization has so far refrained from declaring the coronavirus a health emergency it is closely monitoring the situation closely and may update its guidance as soon as thursday luigi di maio leader of italy s five star movement has announced his resignation from leading the flailing party his departure raises the odds that the eurozone s third largest country s government will collapse triggering early elections matteo salvini s far right liga party s lead in opinion polls is worrying investors eur usd technical analysis eur usd continues trading below the 50 100 and 200 simple moving averages however downside momentum has waned overall the picture is marginally less bearish support awaits at 1 1075 which provided support early in the week next we find 1 1065 which was the trough around christmas the next level is 1 1040 dating back to early december and it is followed by 1 0985 resistance awaits at 1 11 a round number that capped euro dollar on wednesday next we find 1 1120 a swing higher from earlier this week 1 1145 and 1 1175 are next
editor s note politifact is analyzing the democratic presidential candidates stump speeches following our summary of the speech s main themes we present fact checks of specific talking points read other stump speech analyzers for joe biden pete buttigieg amy klobuchar bernie sanders and elizabeth warren the stump speech sanders one hour rally in mason city iowa jan 4 2020 sen bernie sanders a vermont independent running for the demcratic presidential nomination for the second time has perfected his campaign stump speech railing against the establishment and promising dramatic government intervention sanders wields dozens of familiar talking points again and again in a speech in mason city iowa sanders offered versions of more than a dozen specific claims we ve checked before sanders has run an uncompromisingly left wing campaign but he tells his audience to think outside the box when the critics say he is radical and extreme sanders speech is heavy on policy substance in blasting the rigged economy sanders proposes raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour and ensuring equal pay for women he wants to make it easier for workers to join unions and he favors increased spending on infrastructure including clean water inequality is affecting the democratic process too he says billionaires today are buying elections on health care which he calls a crisis sanders pledges that nobody will pay more than 200 for prescription drugs under his policies he touts his medicare for all single payer plan which he says will cover eyeglasses hearing aids and home health care sanders backs universal high quality affordable child care and he says the nation can cancel all student debt through a modest tax on wall street speculation on social issues sanders says that women have a right to control their own bodies and adds that he would only appoint judges who support roe vs wade on guns sanders says he backs universal and extended background checks supports getting rid of the gun show loophole and would ban the sale and distribution of assault rifles at times sanders throws in a localized reference or one pegged to current events on health care sanders cites the special challenges facing rural hospitals on climate change sanders cites the brush fires in australia and urges the rest of the country to follow iowa s lead by investing in wind power one of the rare issues in which he invokes president donald trump by name is immigration sanders says he s sick and tired of trump dehumanizing immigrants and says he will end all the racist executive orders trump has signed biggest applause line sanders says he will make marijuana legal in every state and expunge the records of those arrested for possession of marijuana he says he backs ending the cash bail system as well as the so called war on drugs music power to the people by john lennon and the plastic ono band post trump vision sanders doesn t typically mention trump by name the main exception being on immigration policy his rhetoric focuses more on his own ideas and priorities than trump anything else in response to criticisms that his proposals are too radical to win support sanders quotes nelson mandela everything seems impossible until it happens democratic presidential candidate sen bernie sanders i vt speaks at a campaign event may 30 2019 in las vegas ap john locher fact checking sanders statements three people own more wealth than the bottom half of our nation three people 160 million people we ve rated this true the latest available figures indicate that the total wealth of bill gates jeff bezos and warren buffett was 248 5 billion exceeding the total wealth of 245 billion of the bottom half of americans forty nine percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent we rated this mostly true sanders is referring to growth in pre tax pre government benefit income during the economic recovery following the great recession from 2009 to 2017 however it s not the only way to measure income and more comprehensive studies that account for what people pay to and receive from the government show less dramatic comparisons over the last 45 years the average worker today is not making a penny more in real inflation accounted dollars this is incorrect the median worker in 2018 did make more than one in 1974 once you adjust for inflation that said the growth was quite small a cumulative increase above inflation of only about 11 over those 45 years in the meantime it s also worth noting that the wage data used for this calculation excludes income from social security medicare medicaid food stamps and refundable tax credits like the earned income tax credit so it s an incomplete picture of income women earn 80 cents on the dollar for equal work this is more complicated than it sounds the median earnings for men and women who worked full time year round were 55 291 and 45 097 respectively according to 2018 census bureau data in other words women made 81 6 cents on the dollar compared to men however that is not the figure for equal work the gender discrepancy reflects the professions seniority and hours worked by the two sexes whether by choice or by historical patterns such as discrimination attempts to measure the gap between men and women doing equivalent work have shown a narrower difference though it depends heavily on the specific profession in question we are the only underline only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people we have rated this true in fact there are also numerous non industrialized countries that offer universal health care 30 000 people every year die because they don t get to a doctor we rated this half true because the specific data point is not as certain as sanders makes it seem policy experts agree that thousands of americans die because they cannot afford their health care but his 30 000 people talking point relies on weak math we pay by far not even close the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs studies suggest that the united states for various reasons has higher prescription drug costs than other advanced industrialized nations but it s an exaggeration to say that no other nation is close the commonwealth fund a new york based health policy group compared a basket of common drugs in the united states and several other comparable countries canada the united kingdom france germany switzerland and australia using the american cost as a benchmark of 100 germany s costs rated 95 and switzerland rated 88 however canada the united kingdom and australia were all about half the cost in the united states we are spending twice as much per person on health care as any other country the united states spent more per capita on health care than every other country studied by the organization for economic cooperation and development in 2018 and the u s total was twice as much as most of the countries studied but not all of them the countries that the united states did not exceeded by twice as much in 2018 were switzerland norway germany sweden austria and denmark we have more people in jail than any other country we have more people in jail than china this is accurate according to world prison brief a project of the institute for crime and justice policy research and the university of london s birkbeck college the united states had 2 12 million imprisoned people compared to 1 65 million for china which ranked second on a per capita basis the united states also ranked first in the world ahead of el salvador and turkmenistan china ranked 113rd on a per capita basis our life expectancy is actually going down this is accurate based on the most recent figures from the federal centers for disease control and prevention in the three years since 2014 for which data are available life expectancy dropped in 2015 stayed the same in 2016 and dropped in 2017 that pattern has not been seen in 100 years the cdc says suicides and drug overdoses are significant factors in the increase related who is bernie sanders a bio of the democratic presidential candidate related stump speech analyzers for joe biden pete

there are africans that call for the return of their colonial masters that can be held responsible since african politicians are worse so irresponsible these politicians are selling out everything from government corporations parastatals natural resources to raiding and laundering foreign reserves it is nothing short of divestment by african politicians indirectly giving major shares back to the same foreign corporations and businesses without responsibility that had handed over during indigenization period isabel dos santos africa s richest woman whose father was the president of angola got access to lucrative deals involving land oil diamonds and telecoms another african country rich in natural resources looted worse than nigeria s former oil and petroleum minister diezani madueke did isabel dos santos and her husband were allowed to buy valuable angola state assets in a series of deals typical in most african countries the total amount of foreign investments and foreign aid coming into africa are dwarfed by the amount of kickbacks obnoxious profits and money laundering leaking out of africa legally and illegally each time some of the money looted by politicians and their crony businessmen are eventually repatriated after taking out legal and administrative expenses the returned money is looted again by successive politicians nevertheless african politicians continue to pursue foreigners to deliver them importing experts financial gurus and foreign portfolio investors by incentivizing them with high interest rate returns that can never be sustained and profitable for local businesses or corporations to borrow one may wonder what types of expertise were needed that could not have been trained in any african country since independence in 60 years however training and producing these materials know how and experts at home would block the major loopholes for foreign contracts used by new administrations and their cronies to enrich one another if the local money kept in reserves were invested at home there would be no need to beg or depend on foreign investments from outside they bank most of their loots overseas pauperizing africa nigerian presidential candidate atiku like isabel actually boasted during the campaign that he would sell most of the parastatals as he did as vice president without any advantage to his country politicians ordered central bank to facilitate the transfer of parastatals for their private companies they borrowed the money from private banks to acquire parastatals and let the banks liquidate central bank then bailed them out actually so called foreign portfolio investors main job is to watch developing countries foreign reserves grow so that foreign investors can get ready to make a kill this is why they send out newsletters about which country is ripe enough to be labeled best place to do business emerging markets direct foreign investments the leader in 100 years and more flatteries the local stock market would shoot up based on hot air they would then take their profit out of the country until the cycle is repeated again why do africans echo or rely on the hot air projections of the fox waiting to raid the chicken coop they aid and abet the raiders for crumbs and access indeed once the foreign reserve has grown large enough super powers or corporations can just sell an old fighter jet to one african country for use against its neighbor it is enough to deplete a good part of their foreign reserves most african french speaking countries cannot even touch their foreign reserve in france without the approval of old colonial master think about it foreigners are helping africans deplete local foreign reserves since they know looters do not invest at home without killer profits foreigners would not be rushing to africa to make money either but if foreign investors are given stipulations on long term goals like infrastructure they would label that country hostile without free market or call upon their government to sanction it the free and fair reciprocal market they do not have in their own countries they rig their own economy for the big boys politicians are after foreign odious loans that are known to be going into private pockets based on some warped logic that united states the richest country in the world borrows from the chinese japanese and germans this logic is used by lagos to make tinubu richer than the state itself however usa prints its own 100 00 bills that is worldly popular and abundant outside their country than inside credit worthy is not bankruptcy foreign investors look out for themselves africa must bail itself out like other countries usa can pay back on demand by printing more 100 bills that would be snatched up by many countries including those burying hard currencies in sewage tanks mortuaries or transfer it to their shell companies in panama like other billionaires hiding their money but how acceptable are naira cedi rand shillings or zimbabwe dollar outside africa read also africa foreign investments abroad led to poverty at home it must hastily be noted that heavy government involvement in the economy apart from regulations could be detrimental as in government business is nobody s business it is usually the functions of the private sector businesses and corporations to create jobs the role of governments is to step in where private businesses may be overwhelmed as hospitals schools and infrastructure but must create an enabling environment for all however if china had waited for the private sector to bail the country out of famine and poverty it suffered while africa was flowing with milk and honey china would not be a major competitor on the world stage with united states china uses its influence as a nuclear power and took advantage of western spite against soviet union to gain access to the rich countries trade club indira gandhi former prime minister of indian had called for the same access fair and free trade not handouts china and india have reduced the world s poverty by pulling many of their poor people into middle class while africa s poor keep on increasing china has done so by sensible government interventions and severe punishment for corruption on the other hand african countries with relatively huge income had more money sucked out by foreign pensions and equity investors looking for maximum return in the shortest possible time foreign investors hardly embarked on a long term major project like infrastructure without demanding guarantees or sureties that the same projects would revert back to foreign control if they default always did on the odious loans most loans are bribes for inflated contract between parties to employ their foreign workers as supervisors and above while africans remain laborers the odious loans are not only inflated both parties anticipate defaults because they are not reasonably packaged for payback therefore it is not surprising that chinese are taking over land and infrastructure in zambia ghana sold its major gold industry to foreign investors and nigeria s ajaokuta steel industry has never been viable nigeria
