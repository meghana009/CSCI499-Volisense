the u s dollar s century long reign of the world economy faces a threat over the coming decade as china s renminbi strives to become its successor as some prominent central bankers call for a more sustainable global monetary regime and as cryptocurrencies pose a radically alternative model but as the 2020s begin the dollar looks as strong as ever in global capital markets as of dec 30 an index of the u s dollar s value is up 24 percent over the past decade even as the federal reserve pumped more than 2 trillion of freshly printed money into the financial system and u s national debt more than doubled to about 23 trillion related china may soon have its first blockchain exchange traded fund advertisement the greenback s share of central bank foreign exchange reserves stands at about 62 percent unchanged since jan 1 2010 according to the international monetary fund the second place euro touted by some leading economists in the late 2000s as a potential rival to the dollar saw its share of central bank reserves decline over the past decade to about 20 percent from 26 percent the japanese yen seen as a threat to the dollar in the 1980s now accounts for just 5 4 percent of central bank reserves the british pound which dominated global markets for a century until world war i has a modest share of 4 4 percent with its future uncertain as the u k moves toward an exit from the european union and china despite decades of rapid economic growth and a push by authorities there to expand the renminbi s use in international trade and payments has never seen its currency account for more than 2 percent of central banks reserves as for digital assets frequently touted as the future of money they barely register as an asset class compared with government issued currencies bitcoin s entire market value stands at about 133 billion well below central banks de minimis 218 billion allocation to the renminbi signs of decline the dollar s dominance is under attack though as a growing number of economists and world leaders say the international monetary and financial system looks unsustainable or simply unfair story continues related the bahamas launches digital currency pilot u s consumers benefit disproportionately from the dollar s strength since foreigners are essentially subsidizing americans habit of importing more than they export also global demand for dollar denominated assets helps keep interest rates low on things like treasury bonds despite a u s federal budget deficit of more than 1 trillion a year that dynamic encourages governments businesses and households to take on ever growing amounts of debt which might be difficult to pay back if borrowing costs suddenly jumped thus far the dollar has defied decades of predictions that its demise might be at hand it s like the shepherd crying wolf said martin baily a senior fellow in economic studies at brookings institution who served during the late 1990s as chairman of president bill clinton s council of economic advisers unfortunately sometimes the wolf does come few events of the past year encapsulated the glaring contrast between the dollar s solidifying position and the ever louder calls for change than a speech in august by bank of england governor mark carney an oxford university trained economist carney is widely followed among top monetary experts because he previously served both as head of canada s central bank and as a former executive of the wall street firm goldman sachs invited as a guest speaker to an annual federal reserve retreat in wyoming carney told the u s central bankers the dollar s dominant status contributes not just to instability in emerging market countries but also to a global savings glut that has helped push interest rates artificially low the speech piled onto the worries for fed chair jerome powell already facing caustic criticism from president donald trump for setting interest rates too high past instances of very low rates have tended to coincide with high risk events such as wars financial crises and breaks in the monetary regime carney said left unattended these vulnerabilities are only likely to intensify the solution according to carney the international monetary system might benefit from an alternative to the dollar such as a synthetic hegemonic currency potentially provided through a network of central bank digital currencies the concept is intriguing carney said technology has the potential to disrupt the network externalities that prevent the incumbent global reserve currency from being displaced jens nordviq a former co head of currency strategy for goldman sachs and now ceo of the data provider exante says the fact that very prominent people like carney are seriously discussing the concept shows that it s not a farfetched idea a century of domination the dollar emerged as the world s dominant currency during the early 20th century when it took over from debt strapped britain s pound a century before that holland s guilder was undone by the french emperor napoleon s invasion today the dollar is ubiquitous as ever banks around the world stockpile dollars so they can meet demand from local businesses and residents for the currency to use in commerce and payments central banks stockpile dollars and dollar denominated assets like u s treasury bonds so they can meet the needs of local banks for well dollars cross border bank loans denominated in dollars garnered a world leading 14 percent share of the total in 2018 from 9 5 percent a decade earlier according to the bank of international settlements u s treasury bonds comprise the world s biggest government bond market by far valued at about 17 trillion and growing major global commodities like oil and gold are priced in dollars there is no other asset market as deep or liquid as the dollar asset market said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein a 592 billion u s money manager bitcoin too is generally quoted in dollars along with a growing roster of digital stablecoins whose value is linked to the u s currency facebook s proposed digital asset libra would reportedly be 50 percent backed by dollars even china s planned digital renminbi reportedly part of an effort to unseat the dollar s dominance might just trade like a dollar proxy that s because at least for now authorities peg the renminbi s value to an index of major currencies dominated by the u s dollar the renminbi is at this point not really in the running said edwin truman a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics who oversaw the federal reserve s division of international finance from the late 1970s through the late 1990s the chinese seem to be pushing it as a denomination for trade but that s largely a push rather than a pull of the market after u s economic output caught up with britain s in the early 20th century it still took two and a half more decades for the dollar to definitively replace the pound as the reserve currency of choice harvard university economist jeffrey frankel has attributed the lag to inertia essentially the cost and bother of changing routine payment methods and rewriting legal contracts there s a lot of discussion of substitutes for the dollar as the global reserve currency said bill adams senior international economist for the u s bank pnc but the lesson of the last 10 years is that at least to me it s easier said than done related stories
in 2008 as mountains of bad debt collapsed and economies around the world crumbled carefree gamblers at the central bank owned casino du liban rolled dice and spun roulette wheels unscathed by the global financial crisis beirut glittered as the middle east s party capital and purveyor of discrete financial services lebanon offered wealthy investors something they could not get elsewhere high interest rates for low risk investments while the rest of the world s central banks tried to boost post crisis recovery by holding borrowing costs at 1 per cent or less the banque du liban pushed rates up so high that returns of more than 10 per cent became common for depositors the central bank paid so much because it badly needed a constant supply of dollars to maintain a currency peg against the us dollar pay for imports and fund the government lebanon relies on remittances riad salame central bank governor told the ft in 2018 that reliance on money from overseas left the government vulnerable and sliding ever further into debt especially as economic growth has been sluggish since the start of the arab spring in 2011 a bungled october effort at raising funds via a tax on whatsapp calls triggered lebanon s biggest protests in over a decade adding to the political paralysis and deepening the economic crisis now the debt fuelled crash beirut avoided in 2008 could have finally arrived rating agency fitch is predicting default on 88bn of lebanese public borrowing the country s apparent powers of resilience even as it was surrounded by instability suddenly look more like luck and lebanon is in its most precarious position since its civil war ended in 1990 a harsh economic collapse at the heart of the tumultuous middle east would hurt lebanon s poorest most at a time when public opinion is already enraged by perceived corruption and cronyism it will be very very hard says sibylle rizk public policy director at kulluna irada a lobby group and the possibility of violence and social unrest is high with its nearly 7m population of christians and sunni and shia muslims including over 1m refugees lebanon is surrounded by trouble civil war has raged in next door syria since 2011 and tensions with neighbouring israel are continuous iran backed shia islamist paramilitary and political party hizbollah seen by many lebanese as a defender against israel but viewed by washington as a terrorist group now forms an integral part of lebanon s government souring relations with gulf countries that were once lebanon s sponsors yet even amid these tensions beirut s high life yacht friendly marina and banking secrecy made it a playground for the middle east s wealthy the central bank borrowed from lebanese commercial banks who borrowed from their clients lenders could generate profits at very low risk says nasser saidi a former central bank vice governor for each bank it looked like this was paradise the banks deposits with the central bank grew by over 70 per cent from 2017 to august 2019 to 229trn lebanese lira for some observers the numbers did not add up what could the central bank be investing in to pay those rates says mr saidi but as banks paid out dividends to shareholders many of whom were politicians lebanon s political elites were happy to go along with it everybody got greedy shrugs one bank board member meanwhile politicians were spending the country deep into the red buying votes by expanding public hiring and wasting cash on unsustainable solutions for lebanon s chronically malfunctioning electricity sector while its trade deficit ballooned lebanon s biggest protests in a decade forced the resignation of prime minister saad al hariri s government at the end of october hassan diab a computer sciences professor appointed prime minister designate must now corral lebanon s multi confessional political parties shifting alliances between christian sunni and shia muslim factions into forming a cabinet to steer the country out of crisis amid the growing warnings about a looming default mr hariri had begun to beseech international allies for help and started talks with the imf the west has little interest in seeing this crucible of regional tensions explode the rise of iran backed hizbollah means it can no longer depends on gulf bailouts but while many capitals from paris to tehran want influence in the strategic mediterranean nation no state has so far offered to foot the bill asked whether an aid packaged was on the table david schenker the state department s assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs told the associated press lebanon is not being saved from its financial mess lebanon s drastic downturn came slowly then suddenly after months of economic slowdown and a dollar liquidity squeeze rampant wildfires erupted across the mountains in central lebanon unchecked in part because the state had failed to maintain expensive helicopters days later in an austerity measure to curb its deepening fiscal deficit politicians proposed taxing whatsapp calls lebanon snapped hundreds of thousands have demonstrated since mid october against political corruption bad governance poor infrastructure and economic unfairness beirut s downtown area where bank headquarters are concentrated has been filled with graffiti and tear gas this so called revolution took the lenders by surprise says riad obegi chairman and general manager of banque bemo a lebanese bank the disruption of the protests creates lack of confidence he adds which led to a rush of depositors trying to send money abroad but banks had put half of their assets in the central bank to earn high rates which meant that honouring the transfer requests would have gutted the country s reserves in october the country s banks which had managed to stay open during lebanon s bloody civil war closed for two weeks the union of banking workers said it was for safety economists suspected they were low on dollars and trying to avert a bank run but by closing argues mr saidi the banks themselves triggered panic while their informal capital restrictions generated an accusation that the big depositors were able to get out when they reopened guarded by soldiers clerks told panicked customers they could not send money abroad nor withdraw large sums in dollars we re all in it together bankers told clients but rumours swirled that the politically connected mega rich had already got their money out even as customers could withdraw only 200 per week in cash amid fears about whether their leaders can protect their savings many lebanese worry that the government might choose to prioritise foreign creditors who hold nearly 12bn worth of lebanon s debt so far the central bank has managed to cover the government s repayments to its creditors who are mostly domestic banks however multiple downgrades of lebanon s sovereign debt in the past few months suggest time could be running out locking down lebanon s traditionally open economy with informal capital controls further discourages the all important inflow of dollars indeed the country had already been witnessing a net capital outflow since january 2018 according to goldman sachs research and it has throttled businesses according to infopro research in beirut 160 000 jobs have been lost since the beginning of october and one in 10 companies have closed hospitals are strained after losing bank overdrafts which they had used to cover money they are owed by the government for years lebanese had been assured that their banking sector was safe and the sense of betrayal is palpable protesters have splattered the locked association of banks in blood red paint people spend hours in banks trying to extract their own money to pay rent you see people how shocked they are by the fact that they can t access their money says ms rizk it s because they have been simply deceived the foundations of lebanon s crisis were laid three decades ago when 15 years of fratricidal civil war finally came to an end in 1990 before he became lebanon s prime minister in 1992 rafiq al hariri who was assassinated in 2005 was a construction tycoon who controlled lebanese lender bankmed saad al hariri the recently resigned premier is his son to attract investment for postwar reconstruction and having made his fortune in saudi arabia the billionaire enlisted gulf petrodollars to invest in lebanon and although lebanon was variously occupied by israel and syria until 2005 confidence in mr hariri s vision grew and money and people returned to lebanon during the 1990s and early 2000s mr hariri started borrowing from international markets and his successors did the same by 2019 the state was using almost half its revenues to service external and domestic debt the other half largely went on public wages warlords turned politicians had bought votes by hiring public sector workers from their constituencies meanwhile corruption flourished as the state ran opaque tenders for government contracts despite all the money which came to lebanon says ms rizk we have no infrastructure no productive sector we have nothing all this money was burnt on consumption through imports and real estate which is a bubble and to defend the peg holding the currency peg had helped to stabilise the economy but it is not known at what cost and the potential impact of devaluation will fall most heavily on ordinary lebanese savers who kept their money in lebanese pounds the imf says the pound is around 50 per cent overvalued when asked this month where the exchange rate was going mr salame responded no one knows along with politicians mr salame once rafic al hariri s personal banker has become a figure of fury for the protesters a banker at merrill lynch for two decades he returned to beirut in 1993 to lead the banque du liban and never left as governor mr salame is credited with stabilising an erratic currency by establishing a pegged exchange rate between the us dollar and the lebanese pound his whole legacy his whole metric of success in his mind and the people s mind is the peg says dan azzi a harvard fellow and former top banker with standard chartered in lebanon but from 2011 the dollar flow he needed to defend the pound started to ebb as neighbouring oil economies home to the bulk of lebanese expatriates remitting dollars back to beirut slowed down war in neighbouring syria has also increased lebanon s vulnerability the government continued to rack up debt and imports grew mr salame had to come up with something drastic in 2016 he began a succession of unorthodox measures which he called financial engineering put simply banks lent their customers dollars to the central bank at sky high interest rates in return for buying up swaths of government debt in swap operations on terms that generated profit for lebanese banks the central bank and lebanon s commercial banks balance sheets became overlapping we say there is one bank in lebanon with 40 branches joked the bank board member in his interview with the ft mr salame said that all deposits in the central bank including those of commercial banks were its legal property but by 2016 argues former imf official and economist toufic gaspard who anticipated the crisis in a 2017 paper the central bank became a ponzi scheme it was borrowing from banks to pay them their interest mr salame rejects this accusation the financial engineering was to buy time he said for politicians to reform the bloated government and curb spending but the stability it bought is not a pretext not to do reforms he insists he warned that banque du liban should not be used for politics the central bank is not an instrument to be used in order to force certain changes the state depends on the central bank to meet its dollar debt servicing obligations which will cost around 4bn next year but rating agencies say that on a net basis the bank s foreign currency holdings are negative its forex reserves will be 28bn by the end of the year yet fitch estimates that the central bank s dollar liabilities to lebanese banks stand at 67bn moody s says requests to the imf are credit positive and a new government under mr diab may start talks about a new loan program which could provide some much needed financial stability but first the fractious political factions including hezbollah have to form a government they will also need to win back the support of a sceptical public the whole political system was bought with this ponzi scheme says ms rizk financial times

as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect of broader forces at work as it was a cause of these movements and moments that reshaped the economy over the last 10 years eurozone in crisis in the wake of the recession unsustainably high deficit and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to and a catalyst of britain s 2016 vote to leave the eurozone brexit is kind of the natural outcome of when greece was basically held hostage said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network they were forced into a multi year depression in order to save the euro obviously brexit opens up the possibility more concretely that european countries can leave their union and i m sure that s going to have all kinds of ramifications said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics with nationalism growing in prominence he predicted that the eurozone will face a continuation of these challenges in the coming decade nationalism hits trade the 2010s were marked more broadly by a surge of populist and nationalist sentiment both in the u s and elsewhere around the world a sentiment that is fundamentally reshaping trade between countries and changing the calculus for multinational corporations we ve seen this rise of nationalism which is a political issue reshaping financial markets tremendously said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management for roughly half a century business and industry labored to build manufacturing and production facilities and supply chains to take advantage of the availability of raw materials cheap labor and lax environmental regulations all in a relentless drive for efficiency now that commercial infrastructure is under strain trump s decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership and start a trade war with china is the most visible and consequential manifestation of this trend with his on again off again threats to impose tariffs on europe mexico and other trading partners a close second politics is now taking primacy over economics over the past several decades we ve been building an economically optimized world right now that is no longer the case mcmillan said political economy is now being prioritized over economic efficiency and that s something we haven t seen for decades that takes us back to the 50s fed intervenes to prop up the economy in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve initiated monetary policy with little precedent in modern times it held interest rates at zero for an extended period of time and undertook enormous quantitative easing programs to pump liquidity into financial markets the decade was really remarkable in the sense that for the first six years of the decade we had zero percent interest rates and for the first five years we had quantitative easing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america characterizing the central bank s activities as a wild monetary policy experiment some market observers defend the fed s interventionist streak particularly at the start of the decade with the financial crisis still fresh in people s minds the biggest thing in the last 10 years is the continuation of quantitative easing without quantitative easing i think everything would be drastically different way worse than things are now said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy in hindsight some question whether the fed was too accommodative a stance that could have ramifications for the next recession when the fed cut interest rates to the unprecedented level of zero to 0 25 percent nobody expected it was going to last the seven years that it did mcbride said we ve had way too much easy money for way too long and at some point it s going to come back and get us north said this leaves the fed with fewer tools at hand to boost the economy he said we re leaving very little room for the next recession tax cuts lead to buybacks republicans sweep of the 2016 election facilitated the passage of a massive corporate tax cut financial experts say the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of 2017 had positive results initially but those short term gains could come at the cost of long term pain trump got elected and went on a path of reducing regulation north said i think honestly the reduction in regulation has helped the economy and i think the tax cut helped the economy as well he said but he added that since economic growth fell far short of republicans forecasts the stimulative effects of the tax cut have faded and the national debt has ballooned a risky combination it s putting america on a less stable financial future because of the structure of this unfunded non sustainable tax cut crowley said proponents of the the tax cuts predicted that companies would spend their windfalls expanding and investing in production facilities technology and human capital instead the cuts spurred a wave of corporate stock buybacks which helped propel the market to new record highs but also potentially limited the broader impact the tax cuts were intended to have it s in part a reflection of the fact that there may be in some sectors more than others limited investment or acquisition opportunities or a lack of appealing valuations on those that make a buyback a more palatable way to boost earnings per share said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com every dollar that s going into buybacks is a dollar that s not being used for another form of expansion he said share repurchases have also contributed to stock valuation gains but investing experts warn that this inflation can distort markets more dollars chasing fewer stocks because of all the buybacks isn t something you want long term investors to hang their hat on said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial stock market highs the increase in buybacks is one factor that has contributed to the record long bull market a meteoric rise virtually no one would have predicted 10 years ago when 2010 began the stock market had already begun the long climb out of its recession era hole but the mood was still pessimistic the decade started off very ominously zandi said we began the decade not knowing that the crisis was over we d just suffered the worst economic downturn since the 1930s depression the recession was over officially by june 2009 but it wasn t quite clear that we were out of it since then of course stocks have smashed through one record high after another with valuations boosted by both monetary and fiscal policy mcbride said the fed s trio of rate cuts in 2019 reversed the correction that took place at the end of last year sustaining the bull market for a record setting 10th year that helped cushion the broader economy but it s also helped juiced the equity markets lower interest rates make other investments less appealing he said that enhances the appeal of equities relative to bonds or cash

pushing global demand for advanced drugs and treatments made in switzerland making the industry immune to trade wars and geopolitical crises nearly every second franc swiss companies make abroad is generated in the health sector banking and a watch industry in turmoil what applies to roche novartis actelion and other pharmaceutical companies does not apply to other flagship sectors based in

segment of the watch industry in particular is likely to further weaken exports after a long restructuring period following the 2008 financial crisis the banking sector has regained some stability this has mainly been achieved through measures to reduce risk positions and increase equity despite low interest rates which narrow profit margins swiss bankers feel more confident about the future than before this trend is set to continue in 2020 for the federal government negotiating a free trade agreement with the united states will remain a priority given donald trump s unpredictable foreign policy and the china us trade war it s difficult to predict how this will pan out swiss diplomats remain convinced that it is possible to start negotiations in the short term with a us administration that has been much friendlier towards switzerland since trump moved into the white house switzerland has been invited to saudi arabia to attend the g20 summit which will take place in riyadh in november a first for the alpine nation one subject that s bound to be raised at the gathering is the proposal to charge multinationals taxes in the countries where they sell their goods and services regardless of whether they have a physical presence there if greenlighted the change would be a paradigm shift of historical significance as it would mean that web giants like google and amazon could no longer avoid the taxman the fiscal reform envisaged by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd also foresees the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax rate to prevent companies from having their profits reported in tax havens switzerland is among the countries fighting this major reform as it could lead to a loss of some chf5 billion 5 2 billion in yearly tax revenue the invitation to the g20 summit has been met with some scepticism ngos have denounced the saudi regime for what they say is a public relations operation to gloss over the murder of

continue to drive investors to throw their money into the property market in switzerland housing developments in agglomerations and rural areas are particularly at risk due to the increasing pressure to invest more houses have been built than are in demand creating a high vacancy rate one expert told swissinfo ch that rural areas will soon suffer from structural vacancies empty for three years or more and although vacancies will remain very low in the cities prices will go down the chance that the real estate bubble will burst is high a change in monetary policy to raise interest rates a global recession or a drop in immigration due to souring relations with the european union linked to an end to the free movement of persons agreement any of these could potentially become the trigger history shows that real estate crashes happen roughly every 20 years with the last one in switzerland occurring in the 1990s experts have warned about the bubble for years which means the burst is long overdue and might just occur in 2020 at least in the rural areas swiss law stipulates external linkthat weapons cannot be exported to countries where armed conflict is ongoing nevertheless

national bank as well as state and occupational pension funds from investing in companies that make more than 5 of their profits from conflict weapons the authors of the initiative argue that the swiss people are no longer willing to sacrifice their moral beliefs for these types of investment returns although the authors were able to collect more than 130 000 signatures for the initiative its future at the ballot box is uncertain businesses and the government alike recommend rejecting it external link arguing that it would not lead to the desired goal but would instead have a negative impact on the activities of the institutions in question it would also weaken the swiss financial sector and industry switzerland is a champion of direct democracy yet in global democracy rankings it often fares poorly because of a lack of transparency in political financing of the 47 council of europe member states switzerland is the only one without a law regulating the financing of political

changes parliament has accepted the issue as an urgent one and is currently debating a counter initiative swiss voters will likely have their say on the responsible business initiative in autumn 2020 the text aims to oblige multinationals headquartered in switzerland to do a due diligence review to ensure their activities respect human rights and environmental standards this duty of care would also apply to swiss controlled subsidiaries abroa the initiative also stipulates that a company that causes damage is to be held liable and must compensate victims this means that under civil law companies based in switzerland would be liable for human rights violations or environmental damage that companies they control commit abroad but businesses the government and parliament all say the initiative goes too far for one the federal council the governing body does not want swiss companies to be liable for human rights violations and environmental damage caused by subsidiaries abroad the

rich stable switzerland to face some moral dilemmas keystone gaetan bally switzerland will continue to fare well in 2020 it will stay rich unemployment will remain low and the risk of a economic crisis is next to zero but so much wealth raises questions expect more debates on social responsibility and transparency 8 minutes this first part of our annual outlook scrutinises the economy part 2 to be published on thursday will focus on politics despite a gloomy global economy switzerland should continue to perform well in 2020 experts at the state secretariat for economic affairs seco expect economic dynamics to be essentially identical to 2019 with gross domestic product gdp estimated to grow by 1 7 according to forecasts the unemployment rate and inflation will remain extremely low at 2 4 and 0 1 respectively the pharmaceutical industry will continue to live up to its role as the engine of swiss exports a mix of population growth an ageing population and rising living standards is pushing global demand for advanced drugs and treatments made in switzerland making the industry immune to trade wars and geopolitical crises nearly every second franc swiss companies make abroad is generated in the health sector banking and a watch industry in turmoil what applies to roche novartis actelion and other pharmaceutical companies does not apply to other flagship sectors based in switzerland the watch industry will likely be affected by the unrest in hong kong the biggest market for this branch the increasing demand for smart watches which affects companies in the entry level segment of the watch industry in particular is likely to further weaken exports after a long restructuring period following the 2008 financial crisis the banking sector has regained some stability this has mainly been achieved through measures to reduce risk positions and increase equity despite low interest rates which narrow profit margins swiss bankers feel more confident about the future than before this trend is set to continue in 2020 for the federal government negotiating a free trade agreement with the united states will remain a priority given donald trump s unpredictable foreign policy and the china us trade war it s difficult to predict how this will pan out swiss diplomats remain convinced that it is possible to start negotiations in the short term with a us administration that has been much friendlier towards switzerland since trump moved into the white house switzerland has been invited to saudi arabia to attend the g20 summit which will take place in riyadh in november a first for the alpine nation one subject that s bound to be raised at the gathering is the proposal to charge multinationals taxes in the countries where they sell their goods and services regardless of whether they have a physical presence there if greenlighted the change would be a paradigm shift of historical significance as it would mean that web giants like google and amazon could no longer avoid the taxman the fiscal reform envisaged by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd also foresees the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax rate to prevent companies from having their profits reported in tax havens switzerland is among the countries fighting this major reform as it could lead to a loss of some chf5 billion 5 2 billion in yearly tax revenue the invitation to the g20 summit has been met with some scepticism ngos have denounced the saudi regime for what they say is a public relations operation to gloss over the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi and persistent human rights violations experts warn of a risk of the real estate market overheatingexternal link in europe and switzerland persistent low interest rates continue to drive investors to throw their money into the property market in switzerland housing developments in agglomerations and rural areas are particularly at risk due to the increasing pressure to invest more houses have been built than are in demand creating a high vacancy rate one expert told swissinfo ch that rural areas will soon suffer from structural vacancies empty for three years or more and although vacancies will remain very low in the cities prices will go down the chance that the real estate bubble will burst is high a change in monetary policy to raise interest rates a global recession or a drop in immigration due to souring relations with the european union linked to an end to the free movement of persons agreement any of these could potentially become the trigger history shows that real estate crashes happen roughly every 20 years with the last one in switzerland occurring in the 1990s experts have warned about the bubble for years which means the burst is long overdue and might just occur in 2020 at least in the rural areas swiss law stipulates external linkthat weapons cannot be exported to countries where armed conflict is ongoing nevertheless switzerland is investing in arms that are used for waging war but that could soon change a people s initiative to ban the financing of companies that produce war materiel wants to prohibit the swiss national bank as well as state and occupational pension funds from investing in companies that make more than 5 of their profits from conflict weapons the authors of the initiative argue that the swiss people are no longer willing to sacrifice their moral beliefs for these types of investment returns although the authors were able to collect more than 130 000 signatures for the initiative its future at the ballot box is uncertain businesses and the government alike recommend rejecting it external link arguing that it would not lead to the desired goal but would instead have a negative impact on the activities of the institutions in question it would also weaken the swiss financial sector and industry switzerland is a champion of direct democracy yet in global democracy rankings it often fares poorly because of a lack of transparency in political financing of the 47 council of europe member states switzerland is the only one without a law regulating the financing of political parties rules on financing election campaigns and votes also remain non existent and despite repeated warnings switzerland has not implemented recommendations made by the council s anti corruption

by caroline gerber this is part two of our annual outlook for the coming year focused on the direction equities could take in 2020 during 2019 equities rallied to all time highs despite ongoing concerns about slowing global growth brexit woes and u s china trade tensions dominated headlines throughout 2019 but progress made on both fronts boris johnson s resounding victory in mid december and the possibility of a phase one trade agreement eased investor concerns as well financial markets virtually ignored trump s impeachment on the assumption his removal from office is unlikely during the year the u s federal reserve cut interest rates three times while the european central bank s mario draghi delivered fresh monetary stimulus before the end of his tenure as the ecb president in november christine lagarde took over the position hong kong the center of finance in asia has been wracked by anti government protests that began in june the uncertainty since has been weighing on equities and burdening both the local and possibly global economy keeping markets cautious persistent global economic headwinds have helped boost which rose 15 78 in 2019 political unrest trade war risks and stagnating growth in europe and japan continue to be market hazards gains in oil markets have been tempered by fears of slowing demand growth as well as record high production from the u s although climbed around 34 46 in 2019 this increase appears less dramatic when considering the commodity dropped about 25 from october through december of 2018 here s what some of our most followed contributors expect from gold the u s dollar and markets in general as 2020 begins matthew weller will king dollar regain his throne in 2020 when setting expectations for the currencies to watch in the year ahead over the past couple of years i ve leaned heavily on longer term positioning data from the cftc s commitment of trader cot report as we flip our calendars to a new decade fx traders are relative to the last year however it s worth noting that bullish positioning in the has moderated toward its 52 week low potentially setting the stage for another leg higher in the world s reserve currency this high level sentiment analysis is supported by the fundamental backdrop of the u s economy which continues to outperform the majority of its g10 rivals after cutting interest rates three times in 2019 the federal reserve appears likely to remain throughout the first half of 2020 while major peers such as the european central bank continue to push the envelope with non traditional monetary policy the final factor that has me leaning toward a bullish outlook for the greenback in 2020 is the potential for the u s to open another front in the global trade war recent rhetoric and actions from the trump administration suggest that the self proclaimed tariff man is increasingly dissatisfied with the state of trade between the u s and the european union while the absolute amount of european imports with tariffs is low as of writing we ve seen tit for tat import tax hikes escalate rapidly and with already struggling under the weight of a slowing not to mention the lingering uncertainty around brexit the eurozone is particularly vulnerable to a negative shock since the greek debt crisis nearly a decade ago bears have been salivating over the potential for the single currency to fall to parity 1 00 against the greenback from my perspective it looks like the stage is set for 2020 to finally fulfill that desire mark mead baillie sell spx gold could hit 1675 gold thrives on the 3ds debasement debt and derivatives priced per this writing at 1519 95 our valuation measure by debasement alone of the u s money supply m2 is gold 2991 no price shan t rocket up that far in 2020 however given gold thrives on uncertainty and is without any common sense reason to be sold especially with a major stateside election in the balance come november we re forecasting the year s gold high at 1675 the shall be swung to and fro throughout the year by an ongoing injection of election projection our apolitically objective view by simple mathematics is that the president will be re elected as his voting base will again fully turn out plus some material percentage of the once never trumpers but the trade of the year is to sell the s p going into election day nov 3 even front run it the index is as excessively expensive as we ve ever seen it our live p e as of dec 31 is estimated to be around 25 the s p itself year to date 28 88 and more than one third of the constituents not bettering their bottom lines in 2019 therefore beware as the conservative wave crests and cascades comes the confiscatory undertow michele schneider best trades could be in commodities in 2019 the ratio between stocks and commodities hit a 100 year low as we end 2019 the ratio has contracted some but can shrink much more in 2020 since 1979 inflation has remained muted given statements by steven kaplan the president of the dallas reserve that interest rates will remain low and the future of the dollar as the world s reserve currency is questionable the best trades for 2020 could be in commodities a secret barometer of inflation has emerged from a base should spot sugar s price rise above 13 75 it will clear a 2 year moving average another potential trade to track inflation is the silver to gold ratio has underperformed for years should that ratio flip in silver s favor that too is not only bullish for the metals but a great trade to use to take advantage of rising inflation lance roberts protect capital from what could go wrong there was once a study done on the accuracy of predictions the study took forecasts from a broad group that included everything from psychics to weathermen and came to two conclusions weathermen are the most accurate predictors of the future and their projections are only accurate one out three days while trying to forecast what is going to happen in the financial markets over the coming year is always an annual event these projections should be taken with a very high level of skepticism in our own portfolio management practice we begin with the basic assumption that there is an 88 chance the market will finish the coming year at a level greater than where it started over the last 120 years this is the percentage of positive versus negative markets starting with this basic assumption removes all the guesswork of what has to go right leaving us to focus on the things that could potentially upset the apple cart so as we head into 2020 here is a short list of possibilities we are either currently hedging portfolios against or will potentially need to china fails to comply with the terms of the phase one trade deal reigniting the trade war earnings growth fails to recover its mojo and becomes a valuation concern for the markets corporate profits which have been essentially flat since 2014 deteriorate due to slower economic growth global economic growth remains weak and spreads into the united states the market becomes concerned about excess valuations a credit related event causes a market liquidity crunch convent lite leveraged loans bbb rated downgrades all pose potential threats president trump loses the 2020 election to an anti capitalist while some of these events are indeed outliers to the 2020 market and economy no one expected housing prices to decline in 2008 or the dot com bubble to bust in 2000 as investors it is never what could go right we need to worry about as we are already invested in the markets from our perspective focusing on how to protect our capital from what could go wrong makes much more sense editor s note to read part 1 click

after rebounding against the greenback in 2019 the peso might weaken this year on the back of a possibly wider trade deficit and as investors wait on the sidelines for the clarity of some business related rules in the country such pressures could drag the peso back to the p52 per dollar level according to an economist the peso ended at p50 635 per dollar on dec 27 the last trading day of 2019 stronger by p1 945 year on year from its close of p52 58 on dec 28 2018 in a note to reporters on dec 12 ing bank nv manila senior economist nicholas antonio t mapa said the recent pause in monetary easing by the central bank could be the key to the appreciation of the local unit aside from the seasonal flows of remittances from filipino migrants however given the projected acceleration of the government s infrastructure program we expect the peso to face renewed depreciation pressure in the coming months as the trade balance is forecast to widen further into deficit mr mapa said the bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp last year slashed key policy rates by a total of 75 basis points bps as prices of commodities cooled down resulting in a benign inflation environment after price spikes in 2018 that triggered the bsp rate hikes meanwhile latest data from the philippine statistics authority psa showed the country s balance of trade in goods as of october was at a trade deficit of 3 25 billion slipping 26 4 from the 4 42 trade deficit seen in the same period in 2018 unionbank of the philippines inc chief economist ruben carlo o asuncion also sees that trade recovery would be critical for peso trading specifically the country s import performance he added that perception of the investment climate in the country will also be a key factor for the peso markets and investors need to see and feel the clarity of the rules and the insurance of proper execution on the side of the government mr asuncion said in a text message on dec 27 the corporate income tax and incentives rationalization act citira has been approved in the house of representatives however it is still awaiting its verdict in the senate among the propositions of the bill is the reduction of corporate income tax to 20 from 30 over 10 years to make the country have better competitive advantage in the region where average income tax rate is at 22 4 according to data from the philippine exporters confederation inc meanwhile the peso may be supported by improved risk appetite in 2020 due to recent positive developments in the trade negotiations between the world s two biggest economies for 2020 the peso exchange rate could continue to be relatively stable after the phase one us china trade deal which could be a step in the right direction to support sentiment in emerging market economies and financial markets such as the philippines rizal commercial banking corp rcbc chief economist michael l ricafort said in a text message last friday aside from this mr ricafort is bullish that the country s dollar reserves will help prop up the local currency against the dollar the peso exchange rate could also be supported by new record highs in the country s gir gross international reserves and relatively better bop balance of payments data as well as continued growth in ofw overseas filipino workers remittances bpo business process outsourcing revenues foreign tourism receipts and some pick in foreign investment inflows he added central bank data showed the country s dollar reserves as of end november stood at 86 23 billion which is enough to cover 7 5 months worth of imports of goods and payments of services and primary income meanwhile the country s bop position was at a surplus of 778 million as of the third quarter a reversal of the 1 9 billion deficit logged in the same period a year ago this was on the back of increased net inflows in the financial account paired with a lower deficit in its current account for this week mr ricafort thinks a vital catalyst for peso movement would be us data on employment and new cues for the direction of the us china trade talks he sees that the peso trading at a range of p50 40 50 80 from thursday to friday reuters reported that white house trade adviser peter navarro said in a dec 30 interview with fox that the much awaited phase one deal between washington and beijing would likely be signed by next week although he said that the confirmation will come from us president donald j trump or the us trade representative mr navarro also cited a south china morning post report which said that chinese vice premier liu he would visit the us next week to sign the deal although mr navarro did not confirm it for his part unionbank s mr asuncion expects the local unit to move within the p50 50 50 80 band this week as he expects the strength to continue until we see imports recovering by at most q1 2020 for the entire year rcbc s mr ricafort sees the peso moving around p50 51 versus the dollar meanwhile unionbank s mr asuncion believes the local unit will trade from the p51 52 50 against the dollar with the peso seen to end the year at p52 19 l w t noble with reuters
in 2019 democrats running for president announced a slate of multitrillion dollar proposals aimed at transforming the country and combating the economic and social ills they blame for giving rise to president donald trump but as the year came to a close the mounting price tag of those plans has become a point of contention between the liberal and moderate wings of the party no one inside the beltway seems to ask how much the status quo costs sen bernie sanders i vt wrote thursday on twitter defending his proposals by citing estimates of deaths caused by air pollution and a lack of health care we have the resources and a moral obligation to pass medicare for all and a green new deal sanders agenda would cost more than 50 trillion over 10 years more than the plans of any other democratic candidate like the others he would pay for his plans by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy as democrats seek to appeal to a broad swath of voters candidatesare airing proposals that include government supported health care and child care free college student loan forgiveness transformative climate policies massive pay raises for teachers and a universal basic income among others a washington post review of the major spending proposals of the leading democratic presidential candidates found 10 year costs ranging from about 4 trillion to more than 50 trillion the annual federal budget now is about 4 5 trillion even the most sparse of the 2020 plans dwarfs what successful democrats pushed before as she seized the democratic nomination in 2016 hillary clinton proposed a 10 year agenda estimated at 1 45 trillion according to the committee for a responsible federal budget the rapidly rising price tags and expansive reach of the current plans has led to charges of socialism from republicans but in recent weeks more moderate democrats have been the most vocal critics of their liberal colleagues spending plans on issue after issue we ve got to break out of the washington mind set that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow americans it can antagonize south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg said during the democratic presidential debate this month in los angeles sen amy klobuchar d minn who has said her priority as president would be a 1 trillion infrastructure program has questioned the practicality of her competitors more expensive proposals where i disagree is i just don t think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas she said during the debate i think you can be progressive and practical at the same time the post analysis focused only on the broad categories of health care housing the environment criminal justice education child care and other anti poverty initiatives using self reported estimates from the campaigns of the candidates leading nationally and in early states sanders buttigieg former vice president joe biden and sen elizabeth warren d mass the review found a shared desire to strengthen the social safety net enlarge the federal government and reduce inequality but each arrived at different ways of doing so with varying price tags sanders for example would increase minimum salaries for teachers to 60 000 and provide free breakfast and lunch to every public school student in the country as part of an agenda that tops 51 trillion over 10 years among a set of plans with a total 10 year cost exceeding 30 trillion warren proposes subsidizing child care for almost all americans and reducing rental costs nationwide by 10 percent biden s agenda a more moderate set of proposals costing more than 4 1 trillion over 10 years calls for tripling funding at low income schools and making community college free buttigieg who unveiled a 1 1 trillion 10 year economic plan in november now has spelled out more than 5 5 trillion in federal initiatives he has criticized warren and sanders for their free college programs that would provide a universal benefit regardless of income trump has seized on the democrats spending proposals and led the gop characterization of them as socialists he has warned that the true outcome of democrats plans would be higher taxes they say we re going to give away your health care we re going to do free education we re going to cut student loan debt down to nothing trump said in september during a speech to the house republican conference in baltimore everything is given away yet trump signed a 1 4 trillion spending bill this month that will add more red ink to the record 23 trillion national debt republicans signature legislative achievement under trump a massive 2017 tax cut whose benefits skewed toward corporations and the wealthy has helped pushed the annual federal deficit past 1 trillion but many republicans following trump s lead have largely abandoned the concerns about debt and deficits they expressed during former president barack obama s tenure democrats have likewise felt free to sidestep discussions about the 23 trillion national debt during their primary contest said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the fetters around fiscal responsibility have been thrown off said zandi who has analyzed the spending plans of several democratic presidential candidates there s no real political constituency for fiscal discipline either on the republican or democratic side indeed several trailing democratic candidates have like klobuchar and biden been critical of the spending surge but have found voters largely shrugging off their concerns other lower polling candidates in the historically large primary also have built their candidacies around costly and ambitious initiatives entrepreneur andrew yang has backed a universal basic income of 12 000 per year for every american adult which he estimated would cost 2 4 trillion per year or 24 trillion over 10 years he has also proposed giving 100 in democracy dollars for every american voter to use to participate in the political system sen cory booker d n j has proposed baby bonds for every newborn several candidates have expressed openness to the idea of providing reparations to the descendants of enslaved americans for his part trump has boasted at rallies about spending trillions of dollars on the military and giving more than 28 billion in payouts to farmers affected by the trade war he sparked with china and other countries speaking to a conservative group in west palm beach florida on dec 21 trump praised his administration for securing more than 2 5 trillion in military spending dismissing the idea that the increased funding had added to the growing budget deficit let me tell you about budgets i m a big budget person but when it comes to the military there is no budget he said in his 2016 campaign trump differed from other republicans by brushing aside proposals to curb social security and medicare spending which members of his party had long argued were necessary to halt runaway deficits he has pledged to get serious about fiscal discipline and reducing the deficit if reelected but his campaign has not put forward a plan to cut spending democrats have said trump s 2016 election and the policies he s pursued while in office require bold countermeasures that will level the playing field for middle class americans they ve sought to outdo one another by targeting primary voters concerned about issues including systemic racism climate change and education an nbc news wall street journal poll released this month found that 56 percent of democratic primary voters prefer candidates who propose large scale policies that cost more compared with 38 percent who like candidates pitching less expensive policies that would bring less change but potentially be easier to pass into law with just a few weeks before primary voting begins some of the more moderate candidates are increasingly hopeful voters will be repelled by the rising price tags of the most ambitious proposals biden who is leading the national race in most polls and leads with voters who prefer smaller scale change has repeatedly challenged his rivals to explain how they would pay for their spending programs warren has been the most detailed in outlining the costs of her various plans and how she would pay for them with a 2 percent wealth tax on fortunes exceeding 50 million and other tax hikes on the wealthy warren has said she would be able to fund a broad expansion of the federal government s social contract without raising taxes on middle class americans warren advanced in the polls earlier this year as she released dozens of plans offering vast benefits to most americans by redistributing wealth that has become increasingly concentrated among the rich calculators on her campaign website allow americans to find out how much money they would save through her plan canceling student loan debt and how much extra cash they would receive from her proposal to provide an extra 200 monthly for everyone receiving social security her momentum appeared to stall after she was pressured to release her own plan for universal health care warren s 20 5 trillion proposal her most expensive plan yet would be funded through an array of taxes on the wealthy and corporations both sanders and warren who continue to face bipartisan questions about the costs and feasibility of their health care plans have said most americans would pay less for health care under a government run system that eliminates premiums deductibles and the private insurance companies that collect them but over the course of the year several democratic candidates backed away from medicare for all citing its requisite tax increases and its upending of the private insurance industry i believe this hits the middle class too hard sen kamala harris d calif wrote in july about sanders proposal to pay for his medicare for all plan with a 4 percent income tax on most families harris who had proposed an ambitious agenda estimated at more than 12 3 trillion dropped out of the primary this month in addition to his medicare for all proposal eliminating out of pocket health care costs sanders has also pledged to have the government wipe out all 1 6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt his proposal announced in june went even further than warren s pledge to eliminate debt for 95 percent of the people who have student loans sanders has pledged to pay for his agenda by reversing trump s tax cuts and imposing a wealth tax and a series of tax hikes on the finance industry and more he has acknowledged that his health care plan would raise taxes on middle class americans but he insists that would be offset by the trimmed costs candidates have also touted 13 figure price tags as they ve competed to show their visions for combating climate change warren s 3 trillion plans include a tenfold increase in federal spending on clean energy research and development she also proposed a 10 7 trillion green jobs plan to invest in environmentally friendly industries buttigieg s 1 5 trillion plan creates a national extreme weather insurance program biden s 1 7 trillion plan aims to achieve net zero emissions of carbon pollution by 2050 sanders has boasted that his plan the most expensive at 16 3 trillion would declare climate change a national emergency eliminate fracking and ban all imports and exports of fossil fuels several candidates have pushed ahead with expensive plans by arguing that the cost of not acting far exceeds the price tag for their proposals my opponents and critics say bernie you re proposing to spend a lot of money on climate sanders said recently at a rally in los angeles and i say what is the alternative others have followed the example of trump who was able to win in 2016 by making broad promises that connected with voters while disregarding political structures of washington policymaking such as detailing how he would pay for it said michael strain an economist at the right leaning american enterprise institute these policies are so large and so different from what we ve

lenci sickler a fifth generation farmer who oversees more than 10 000 acres in western north dakota stops short of saying whether farmers in southern states are better off than his peers in the midwest the payment rates vary by county but a 2019 federal payment program intended to help farmers facing low prices caused by president donald trump s trade war with china has paid the south higher rates than the midwest the payments are intended to support farmers for crops like soybeans and corn that were subject to retaliatory tariffs from china in north dakota which typically sends more than two thirds of its soybeans to china it s more expensive to send exports to new markets such as europe lawmakers academics and farmers question whether the aid has favored certain regions and states and whether the payments line up with farmers actual economic losses local farmers in western north dakota whose counties are generally receiving a lower rate than eastern counties are disappointed about the rates though they won t complain sickler said but it s still a little disheartening to know that we were at the bottom of the list just based on locations farmers in the midwest face tough decisions heading into the new year after being walloped by historic rain and flooding on top of trade uncertainties and several years of low commodity prices even with the apparent end to trump s trade war with china they ll continue to endure 2019 s unprecedented economic and weather challenges economists predict fewer crops in the dakotas illinois indiana and ohio it s likely the u s department of agriculture will distribute a third tranche of the trade related payments called market facilitation program mfp payments to farmers who grow soybeans corn and other crops affected by the tariffs it s not yet known who would be eligible how payments would be distributed or when this year s payments of up to 14 5 billion have been critical to shoring up the farm economy they also picked winners and losers between regions and crops according to a november report from democratic members of the u s senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry fueling a partisan fight on capitol hill the report provides evidence that the 2019 mfp awarded 95 of top payment rates to southern farmers helped wealthy farms and foreign companies and offered no long term investment or plan for rebuilding lost markets the minority members represent the corn belt west and northeast but states in the midwest which have more farmers and farm acreage have received the highest payouts across two years of the program rough estimates show illinois 6 billion and iowa 5 billion at the top followed by minnesota 7 billion and kansas 6 billion between the market facilitation program and two additional programs the trump administration has authorized roughly 28 billion in 2018 and 2019 to compensate farmers and ranchers for their losses caused by trade tariffs and to shore up political support from an important constituency according to a november report from the conservative american enterprise institute the differences between the 2018 and 2019 programs and a lack of transparency in how this year s payments were calculated has opened the usda to criticism unlike the 2018 payments which were based on production this year s payment rates were distributed on a per acre basis and range from 15 to 150 rates of more than 100 an acre are concentrated in georgia alabama mississippi arkansas texas and arizona according to the university of illinois publication farmdoc daily the difference is caused in part by the increasing mfp payment per pound of cotton which went from 6 cents to 26 cents between 2018 and 2019 cotton is largely produced in the south by contrast the payment per pound of corn went from 1 cent to 14 cents counties in the west upper midwest and eastern seaboard tended to be paid at rates below 50 an acre the average payment rate in north dakota where agriculture represents about a quarter of the state s economy was 31 an acre many counties in the southwestern part of the state were paid at the minimum rate southeastern north dakota where five counties rank among the top 20 soybean bushel producers in the country was paid at rates up to 60 an acre as in other states payment rates in neighboring counties differed wildly it s not equitable necessarily from farm to farm said mark watne president of the north dakota farmers union and then it s not enough to offset what may have been substantially higher prices had we not had a trade war we d rather have better trade the market facilitation program was designed to support farmers facing low prices for their crops because of trade disputes and retaliatory tariffs and not to provide relief from natural disasters flooding and other extreme weather the first year of payments in 2018 was restricted to producers of a limited number of crops soybeans corn cotton sorghum wheat sweet cherries shelled almonds and hog and dairy producers crop payments were based on harvested production in 2018 and the value of u s exports after chinese tariffs in 2019 the program took a different approach to avoid influencing planting decisions as officials had the year before they estimated damage from retaliatory tariffs but the number of eligible crops increased from nine to 41 among the new crops were chickpeas dried beans and lentils but announcing a second payment year in may had broader effects no official at usda would have ever announced a payment like this in a planting season said jonathan coppess a clinical assistant professor in agricultural and consumer economics at the university of illinois at urbana champaign one of the results of that we re seeing is late harvest just having a late planting season is not an isolated incident it causes other challenges per acre payment rates were based on the impact of unjustified trade retaliation in that county according to the usda the department calculated the aggregate effect on commodities in each county and divided that figure by the average total acres of eligible crops reported to the department between 2015 and 2018 while about three fourths of 2018 payments went to soybean growers and were concentrated in corn belt states that changed this year producers growing different eligible crops received the same payment rate because the rates were set by county rather than by crop during an october hearing of the u s senate agriculture committee usda deputy secretary stephen censky insisted the 2019 mfp payments are equitable and based on models the department created to show the effects of retaliatory tariffs that has been done on a consistent basis without any kind of consideration of north south east west or anything like that to take a look at what are the actual effects censky said according to the senate democrats five southern states georgia mississippi alabama tennessee and arkansas received the highest per acre payment rates in the first round of 2019 mfp payments and while the impacts of the retaliatory tariffs are widespread the payment rates have not aligned to help the regions and crops harmed the most according to the report by the senate agriculture committee s democratic members meghan cline communications director for the committee s republican chairman u s sen pat roberts of kansas did not respond to several requests for comment other critics point to a lack of transparency in how the usda calculated mfp payment rates the broad discretion it allows agriculture secretary sonny perdue to spend taxpayer dollars without congressional approval and a failure to account for cross commodity effects for example low soybean prices lead to low canola oil prices canola farmers are considered in the county payment rates but the 2019 program doesn t attach a price to canola the pressure on the mfp program the political pressure is growing and it signals a bigger problem in the farm economy said david widmar an agricultural economist at agricultural economic insights llc producers still to this day are not profitable enough to cover all their obligations amid 2019 s economic and weather challenges producers sought help from an array of federal programs in addition to mfp they had access to crop insurance disaster assistance regular crop programs and cover crop payments it s unclear to what extent the programs interacted and whether the usda considered the potential for overlapping payments said carl zulauf professor emeritus in the department of agricultural environmental and development economics at the ohio state university in columbus i think that s a really important policy question that we as policy analysts and policymakers need to grapple with zulauf said when you sum the programs together were farmers overcompensated for losses due to natural disasters to be sure payments are providing much needed cash flow to struggling farms agricultural credit conditions and farm incomes are expected to continue declining in coming months in states including missouri kansas and nebraska according to a november report from the federal reserve bank of kansas city in missouri meanwhile farm bankruptcies were up 24 in 2019 from 2018 over the 12 month period ending in september chapter 12 filings were highest in wisconsin 48 followed by georgia nebraska and kansas 37 each iowa kansas minnesota nebraska south dakota and wisconsin were among the states that experienced filings at or above 10 year highs according to the american farm bureau federation farmers won t complain about the mfp payments said sickler the north dakota farmer but i think most farmers would echo we d rather have better trade dakota farming this year spring and fall flooding battered the dakotas and other midwestern states republican governors in north and south dakota declared emergencies and the states received federal disaster relief agricultural producers had trouble getting out into saturated fields for spring planting and again months later for fall harvest historic flooding and rainfall prevented a record 19 6 million acres from being planted across the country this year south dakota led all states with 3 9 million acres followed by ohio at 1 6 million acres illinois at 1 5 million acres and missouri at 1 4 million acres only two of the top 10 states arkansas 1 33 million acres and texas 867 000 acres are outside the midwest unplanted acres were not eligible for market facilitation program payments it s hard for a farmer to just not plant said krista joy swanson a farmer and visiting research specialist in agricultural and consumer economics at the university of illinois at urbana champaign it s in your blood it s your passion it s what you want to do but there was still an opportunity for those farmers to receive a market facilitation program payment they could have filed a claim for prevented planting insurance coverage that protects producers who are unable to plant a crop by a certain date and subsequently planted a cover crop that was eligible for payment through the program if they did they were eligible for payments at the minimum 15 an acre rate those individuals that had the prevent planting came out with a hell of a lot more welfare than anyone else said doug sombke president of the south dakota farmers union because they got paid not only for the prevent planting and their crop insurance but they also got paid for the loss of marketplace on acres they didn t grow anything on the lack of planting reached local economies beyond farms if a farmer spends roughly 500 an acre on things such as soil sampling chemicals and seed sales that s 500 multiplied by the prevent planting acres that isn t being spent with ancillary businesses sombke said they re under extreme financial pressure right now sombke said of the other businesses but guess what they don t have an mfp payment or crop insurance that covers them when the agricultural industry suffers farmers make fewer purchases said south dakota state sen arthur rusch a republican our sales tax revenues are lower which is a big source of revenue here in south dakota so it s all interconnected rusch introduced a concurrent resolution in january 2019 urging trump to make agricultural exports a priority and protect agricultural products from tariffs it was adopted by the senate but not the house in her december budget address south dakota gov kristi noem a republican noted that agriculture faces an uncertain outlook in 2020 the budget did not include discretionary inflation increases for overall k 12 education medicaid providers and state employees among the state s biggest expenditures her concern is that the revenue isn t there rusch said and that s largely because of the poor farm economy which is not entirely due to the trade tariffs but that has had a significant effect as a u s china trade deal looms there s hope along with skepticism that the uncertainty is coming to an end even if a deal advances farmers face a long road ahead how do we transition from the end of the trade war if it ends today to where the markets catch up said widmar the agricultural economist china is not going to wake up tomorrow and buy all the beans they haven t bought over the past 18 months

expire in early 2021 also on rt com avangard changes everything what russia s hypersonic warhead deployment means for the global arms race president trump has criticized the treaty as advantageous to

syria announced with iran hawks such as john bolton out of the picture it is unclear whether or not the us will launch a strike against iran in 2020 as president trump seeks to be re elected in the new year a hot war with iran may be the last thing on his mind however the tit for tats and multiple accusations levied against iran namely that it has been targeting us forces and major allies in the

and people to people exchanges eu learning to live without britain neil clark journalist writer broadcaster and award winning blogger one of the most cogent arguments for supporting brexit from a genuinely internationalist viewpoint was that without britain the eu would go in a better direction certainly in regards to its foreign policy the uk where neocon influence in the establishment remains very strong even after iraq and libya urged the eu to lift its arms embargo on syrian rebels and has also been the most hawkish of the major eu powers on sanctioning russia the downside of brexit from a brussels perspective is that the third largest net contributor to the eu budget is leaving so that hole in the finances will have to be covered after the transition period ends the eu faces a challenging year but predictions of a total collapse are likely to be proven wrong again the eu is simply too big to fail paradoxically brexit could help it in the medium or long term

it was a careening year for the economy at the start of 2019 there was mounting anticipation around the future direction the government was going to adopt as the foreign exchange reserves continued to slide borrowing from friendly countries was in full swing the imf negotiations were not moving forward and an announcement of a mini budget had been made for later in the month confusion prevailed as the market looked for hopeful signs of forceful steps to be taken to control a runaway fiscal deficit that was being plugged with borrowings from the state bank of pakistan since banks were also refusing to lend to government despite massive interest rate hikes read getting down to business in 2019 highlights from pakistan s economic year in short the financial markets were stalled as they awaited a decision by the government on how it was going to tackle the twin deficits fiscal and external by the time the fiscal year ended the government had put out among the worst fiscal numbers ever seen in pakistan s history with zero growth in revenue collection and the highest ever fiscal deficit equal to 8 9 per cent of gdp on the external side the continuous declines in the foreign exchange reserves continued making it necessary for the country to borrow up to 5 billion from saudi arabia and the uae in short term deposits on the domestic side the situation was even more dire when the government entered office the total stock of domestic debt was around rs9 trillion of which around rs3tr was borrowed from the state bank of pakistan meaning it was money that was printed to help pay government bills by january and february the stock of domestic debt touched rs11tr with almost rs7 5tr of it borrowed from the state bank in proportional terms borrowing from the state bank accounted for around one third of total domestic debt in july 2018 and by early 2019 this proportion had crossed two thirds this massive monetisation of the deficit became one of the biggest reasons for high inflation which began its relentless climb in early 2019 and the external borrowing entangled the country in the geopolitical preferences of its creditors the gulf arabs yet at the start of 2019 then finance minister asad umar preferred to talk of a home grown package of economic reforms to meet the challenges of the twin deficits and spoke as if the period of adjustment was already over pointing out that larger borrowing from the private sector was a sign of returning health and inflation and currency depreciations might soon be reaching a plateau from a home grown programme to chasing an ambitious revenue target much has been said and heard by all concerned will the govt walk the critical walk in 2020 then came the massive u turn a sudden and dramatic turn in april no sooner had asad umar returned from washington dc after attending the spring meetings of the imf and the world bank and was preparing to announce a major breakthrough in the talks than the prime minister himself announced that a new advisor on finance was being appointed the name was an old one dr abdul hafeez shaikh who had served in various capacities in the musharraf regime as well as had been the finance minister in the ppp government from 2010 till 2013 shaikh moved fast and decisively within days of his coming into office he signed an agreement with the imf and soon the state bank governor was also replaced with a deep imf insider dr reza baqir it was not clear what the terms of the agreement signed with the imf were at that point in time but as interest rates continued rising to hit 13 25pc by june 2019 currency depreciations continued unabated and a budget was announced with the most ambitious revenue target of any budget in pakistan s history it became clear that a very tough imf programme had just been signed as the details were released in july 2019 the country saw for the first time what was to lie in store for the next three years the revenue target was not only the most ambitious ever seen but the next year was to continue on this trajectory interest rates would be pegged solely to inflation with no regard to the impact on economic growth and exchange rates were to be market determined from here onwards after the budget the government launched its documentation drive trying to get the services sector to register its incomes particularly traders a new face had been brought in specifically for this purpose shabbar zaidi a private sector chartered accountant from karachi was famous for highlighting tax evasion by the services sector and partially in

idea make it mandatory for all parties to collect personal identities of their vendors when making or receiving any payment this had been tried before in the early 2000s as well as for a brief moment by the ppp government in 2009 but had always spurred spirited opposition this time it was not only going to be done on a massive scale but it had been made an integral part of the revenue effort to be launched in pursuit of the most ambitious revenue target any government had ever seen as the implementation of the budget began strikes were announced by trader communities around the country and the government quickly buckled it postponed the implementation of the condition to keep identity records of all sales and purchases then once again in october as the deadline expired a second round of strikes forced the government to postpone the implementation one more time now they are saying implementation of the condition begins from january 1 but the traders are still in no mood to comply from a home grown programme to mounting debt to chasing an ambitious revenue target and keeping the exchange rate and interest rates pegged on market dynamics the government has talked the big talk throughout 2019 but in its actions it has turned away from the difficult consequences of its actions every chance it had the year 2020 will be the test of the government s decisiveness published in

this article is more than 4 years old stocks did great over the departed decade of the 2010s following up on a decline in the 2000s it was uncannily like the 1980s and the 1970s divide the indexes by 10 and the results were quite identical getty images the dow industrials entered the 2010s around 10 000 and ended 2019 at some 28 000 in the 1980s the start and finish was a little below 1 000 and 2 800 the index began the 2000s a tad over 10 000 and ended around there in the 1970s the decade came and went not far from 1 000 so great we had another 1980s that must mean the 1990s are next with the dow at 100 000 when we party like it s 2029 and why should we care so much what the stock market is up to silly that s where the middle class socks away its savings but why there again so we become an ownership society or something no so you break even if you save money conventionally you get less than nothing interest is zip these days and therefore negative against dollar depreciation if you have stocks you made 5 3 per year peak to peak in the 20 years since 1999 based on the dow 5 3 per year for 20 years on 10 000 yields 28 000 investment fees will average about 1 3 inflation another 2 and taxes up to another 2 there s the 5 3 the whole thing expresses the burden of overcoming monetary and fiscal policy given that we lack a classical currency regime we have to hedge the dollar the 2 inflation premium given that we have big government we have to pay the piper the 2 in taxes and to make that 4 to overcome the currency non regime and the fiscal state we pay advisors 1 3 by piling money into the market into 401 k s etc with the assistance of the army of advisers populating this fair land in every corner of it the great american middle class broke even this millennium and when the money went into a college savings plan it too went nowhere while free from taxes this money so dedicated made the colleges jack up their prices readers of that cultural totem of the 1990s and 2000s rich dad poor dad will recognize all this counsels the book if you put money in stocks you are saving money 401 k s are a savings plan you are an investor if and only if you are closely involved in running an operation based on your capital there must be some mild hit that economic growth is taking in this country owing to the misplaced sense on the part of our hundreds of millions of middle classites that they are investors the misapprehension that putting money in the market makes one an investor satiates some modicum of persons surely who otherwise would have the ambition to be entrepreneurs and how about all those advisers finance now gobbles up 12 of gdp up from 3 in 1970 back when we had a gold standard and saving money as one stayed more than whole in doing so was easy routine put it in the bank or bonds or even a safe box and watch your real resources grow let s say 5 of this 12 represents the many ministers to the middle class s savings plans the 401 k s etc we kill 1 trillion a year so we can save money this army group of financial planners retirement specialists and financial industry factotums is everywhere too every small town storefront mall shopping district downtown edge city coverage that would shame a cell phone plan or a curves or subway and they have to be fairly well compensated the 1 3 in fees to have the look at least of affluence lexuses at the minimum a financial adviser driving a beater unthinkable in the old days say that of fred schwed s 1940 classic where are the customers yachts or somerset maugham s razor s edge it was understood that families herded their dimmer bulbs into the brokerage industry we ll set you up with the aunts and uncles accounts and you can collect a sliver of the fees those with more of a head for things would not be a broker but rather actually involved in business or a sophisticated profession there is no reason that this industry standard should have changed perhaps it has just changed clothes in the thomas carlyle sense saving money is by nature mediocre meaning that those who make their life ministering to it tend to average have you noticed how the retirement planning industry over the 2000s has altered the standard recommendation for portfolio allocation they used to say the stock percentage should be 100 minus your age upped to 110 minus age now that is gone and they say 80 in stocks till you near the witching hour and dip to 70 that bumped up retirement cash is in dow 28 000 finance takes up 12 of gdp health care that creature of the tax exempt code and medicare bylaws 18 it was 5 in 1965 government 33 that s pushing 50 of economic output as semi garbage goods in a better world finance and healthcare could be halved with arguably an enhancement in outcomes government well saying it could be better by halving it does not quite capture the matter it stops one cold to think about who is doing the real producing in this country perhaps half of the country is responsible for all of the trappings of the legendary affluence that a great part of this big american population does in fact enjoy and live in every day our refusal to revert to a classical currency regime coupled with government s yen for tax rates has allocated whole classes of professionals into servicing this very matter this problem of our monetary and fiscal state the middle class stock market fixation is essentially entirely a function of this problem it gives one pause what if we could have fully half of the current financial industry doing something more genuinely productive it even gives one pause about all this inequality handwringing could it be what a thought that we have not rewarded our real producers enough

president trump s economy is a resounding success so far economic growth has averaged 2 6 percent the bush and obama presidencies together posted less than 2 percent historically low unemployment is promoting greater racial and gender equality wages are advancing at about a 3 7 percent annual pace after falling to 2 5 percent during the final years of the obama presidency gains are increasingly flowing to lower income americans and minorities as blue collar industries like construction and maintenance face shortages of workers the president s apprenticeship program is opening new high paying opportunities across the economy for non college bound youth in november women rose to fully half of all non farm employees in 2018 women opened businesses at nearly twice the pace as during the prior six years and college women are shifting in greater numbers to once male dominated higher paying college majors those should do a great deal to substantially reduce the gender pay gap democrats like to harp about inequality and an unfair economy but that s what mr trump inherited from his predecessor now his polices are turning things around to the satisfaction of americans a recent economist you gov survey found 60 percent of americans are happy or very happy with their jobs only 13 percent said the reverse and many more say they are better off today as compared to four years ago than voiced the reverse sentiment economists and the media have made a lot of his trade wars and claim manufacturing is in a recession but that sector normalizing for the temporary disruptions imposed by the gm strike has gained jobs during 31 of 33 months of the trump presidency firms like gm and ford are focusing not on cluttering the road with more vehicles but rather on enhancing the nature of what they make investing in r d for artificial intelligence assisted driving to improve safety and electric vehicles that doesn t require more factories and machines but rather more intellectual property that shows up in higher value vehicles fewer fatalities and a cleaner environment retailers and other businesses are sourcing less from china and somewhat more from u s factories and from mexico and other asian locations nations that don t throw up barriers to u s exports or steal our technology with the zeal of beijing s subsidized enterprises the midwest is losing jobs in agriculture and in some manufacturing sectors in the face of chinese retaliation and a phase one trade agreement focused on agriculture patent protection and financial services won t fix a lot of that cheap currencies drove china s farm imports to argentina and brazil as much as its tariffs and chinese enterprises will still be able to force technology transfers through mandatory joint ventures and by selling counterfeit products through offshore platforms however a robust jobs market is opening new opportunities in key states like wisconsin and iowa as some farms and factories shed workers other employers are crowding the gates to recruit the new workers as they leave in the trump economy a midwesterner would have to stay in bed not to find a decent job going forward the impeachment farce should be behind the president by spring and then he should challenge the congress on unfinished business the country needs immigration reform and the president has advocated moving toward a skilled based system akin to the canadian and australian regimes higher education debt is causing young people to delay marriage children and home purchases and far reaching and quick debt relief forgiveness can get us out of that box universities that lured students into dead end majors should be made to pay up to contain china s mercantilism and increasingly aggressive foreign policy we need allies and their cooperation getting the u s mexico canada free trade agreement usmca through congress is a relatively easy lift at least mr trump and house speaker nancy pelosi essentially agree on its overall benefits however the president and his trade representative must back off confrontation to re engage our allies in asia and europe by reopening discussions for u s membership in the trans pacific partnership and reforms to modernize the world trade organization wto that s a tough but necessary course adjustment for mr trump but the hard left that dominates the democratic party is decidedly isolationist and protectionism americans generally see the threat posed by china and most want more cooperation with our friends that s the pivot mr trump must make to keep robust growth going and get an a from this professor peter morici is an economist and business professor at the university of maryland and a national columnist copyright c 2019 news world communications inc this content is published through a licensing agreement with acquire media using its newsedge technology
after profiting from strong markets in 2019 investors are expecting 2020 to bring further rising asset prices and lively merger activity but brexit the us presidential election and the us trade war with china could all spring nasty surprises over the next 12 months and give the long running bull market a jolt the uk and brexit relief that brexit is resolved will be replaced by anxiety over the future relationship between britain and the eu with the transition period due to end in december 2020 dean turner a uk economist at ubs global wealth management predicts uk gdp will only rise by 0 9 in 2020 even weaker than the 1 2 in 2019 it s possible that there will be some bounce in activity given the clarity on brexit but any improvement in sentiment is likely to fade as the next brexit deadline draws closer turner says ruth lea an economic adviser to the arbuthnot banking group believes the uk will get a fiscal boost from the forthcoming budget due in february this could include an increase in the threshold for paying national insurance in effect a tax cut the economy has been facing the twin headwinds of brexit uncertainty which has almost certainly depressed business investment and could also have undermined the consumer and the weaker global economy especially in the eurozone having said that there still seems to be growth lea says view image in fullscreen boris johnson faces further tough talks with brussels that could hit sterling photograph pier marco tacca getty images the london stock market shrugged off brexit anxiety during 2019 to post its best year since 2016 several analysts predict it will rally in 2020 as relatively unloved uk shares are embraced by investors again jeremy podger who manages fidelity s 2 7bn global special situations fund says the city should benefit from the increased certainty created by the conservative win in last month s election it appears to be the case that in general investors have been taking money out of the uk stock market since the referendum and that it is generally underrepresented in many international portfolios this result could be a trigger for these investors to neutralise their exposure while existing investors are unlikely to sell for now podger explains but the prospect of fresh tough negotiations between london and brussels over their future relationship will probably weigh heavily on sterling in 2020 the uk could crash on to world trade organization trade rules in a year s time if it cannot reach an agreement and refuses to extend the transition period this would be a significant step down from the current arrangement and an arrangement that investors fear will negatively impact the uk economy says fiona cincotta of city index takeovers in the uk this year there could also be a rise in takeover activity jonathan boyers the head of mergers and acquisitions at kpmg predicts a flurry of deals in the next six months now the uk has a stable government many of those who have been mulling over an exit have done their early prep work and are set to launch processes in the new year meanwhile i expect there will be a significant amount of demand keeping prices high as the market makes up for some of the lost volume boyers says ben higson the head of the london corporate practice at law firm hogan lovells also expects a dynamic mergers and acquisitions market in 2020 the removal of political uncertainty in the uk has resulted in early signs of confidence returning to deal making activity keeping boardrooms and other decision makers busy in the final weeks of the year and we expect early in the new year says higson trump and us markets donald trump s attempt to win a second term is likely to dominate the headlines for much of the next 12 months markets often do well in an election year partly because the white house incumbent has every incentive to make people feel richer trump is rumoured to be considering a fiscal boost known as tax cuts 2 0 which could lift his popularity and stocks before the november election many investors have priced in a trump re election says edward moya of the foreign exchange firm oanda a republican win has been wall street s base case for a while so a democratic win could startle the markets despite the strong economy key battleground states such as wisconsin ohio michigan and pennsylvania all have biden leading trump in recent polls a biden presidency would still be positive for us stocks but perhaps a few percentage points lower than a trump victory moya points out but if elizabeth warren or bernie sanders were to beat trump tech stocks banks and pharmaceuticals firms could all face tougher regulation triggering a sell off john moore a senior investment manager at brewin dolphin says political concerns are already being priced into some stocks elizabeth warren for example has made no secret of her feelings about facebook and a desire to break up some of the other tech giants other candidates have

war would inevitably tip the german economy into recession the us economy is enjoying its longest expansion ever having been growing for more than 10 years fears of a recession in 2019 proved unfounded but the trade tensions stirred up by trump are bad for growth trade tensions will continue to foster unpredictability in economic policymaking and cause a drag on demand and capital investment predicts los angeles based hercules investments china and the us are due to sign their phase one trade deal this month but there is a risk of this dispute flaring up again leading to tariffs being reimposed on imports that would have a chilling impact on the global economy china s economy is also likely to keep cooling in 2020 having slowed to its slowest annual growth rate in three decades in 2019 at 6 beijing will keep trying to jumpstart growth in 2020 but nariman behravesh the chief economist of ihs markit says china is fighting structural factors including an ageing population and weaker productivity growth we predict china s growth rate will slide even further to 5 7 in 2020 and 5 6 in 2021 unless the government puts in place a more aggressive stimulus programme behravesh says markit also predicts that the us economy will grow by about 2 1 during 2020 below the 3 targeted by trump its manufacturing sector has slowed in recent months but december s jobs report did beat forecasts an encouraging sign for trump central banks central banks will once again have a major impact on the financial markets beyond their traditional remit of price stability the us federal reserve is expected to leave interest rates on hold but could cut borrowing costs if economic data turns sour in europe christine lagarde is overseeing a review of the european central bank s operations with a new focus on the climate emergency but she s not expected to change the ecb s dovish approach so interest rates could remain at record lows for some time in the uk interest rates

tripoli libya ap when the european union started funneling millions of euros into libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the mediterranean the money came with eu promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking that hasn t happened instead the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found the eu has sent more than 327 9 million euros to libya with an additional 41 million approved in early december largely channeled through u n agencies the ap found that in a country without a functioning government huge sums of european money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants in some cases u n officials knew militia networks were getting the money according to internal emails the militias torture extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the u n often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers sold to traffickers or to other centers
in this article i am going to do a couple of things first of all i am going to tell you why i believe that commodities are going to accelerate further as they started to gain momentum recently then i will show you why i think murphy oil nyse mur will benefit from this trend this company has made great efforts to change its business after a few very volatile years and the company is much better positioned to benefit from higher oil prices in addition to that the company is paying a healthy dividend has solid financials a good attitude towards its shareholders and is rebounding after forming a long term double bottom all things considered i believe this stock is headed higher source murphy oil corporation the economy dollar index commodities while i am writing this we are in the final days of the 2019 calendar year the s p 500 is up slightly less than 30 since the start of the year while energy stocks are up 8 believe it or not underperforming cyclicals are pretty much the only thing the stock market has given investors as a result of the declining economy in november the leading economic ism manufacturing index had its fourth consecutive reading below the neutral 50 level in this case the index was 1 9 points in contraction territory after peaking in the second half of 2018 this has pushed down everything ranging from industrial production to shipments and earnings from some cyclical companies however unlike in the prior cycle stocks do not seem to care as we go from one all time high to another back in 2018 i discussed the increasing odds of a growth slowing trend back then it was a very contrarian call as most investors were still enjoying the massive 2017 gains and economic growth was still high at this point i am once again making a slightly different call as i think we could see higher growth starting in the first quarter of 2020 one of the reasons is the development of the global wrecking ball called the us dollar the reason why it s a wrecking ball is because a strong dollar pressures countries with high dollar denominated debt levels the graph below shows the development of us dollar euro and yen borrowing levels foreign countries used lower post 2008 rates to cheaply finance growth this is fine as long as the dollar does not rapidly rise source reuters october 2019 when the dollar goes up debt levels rise dollar denominated commodities become relatively more expensive and demand usually goes down that s one side of the story the other side is a cycle of dollar weakness this achieves the exact opposite as it eases pressure from debt supports commodity prices and overall stimulated a risk on scenario below you see the dollar index what seems very unspectacular could be the start of something big the dollar index is rolling over as major currencies like the euro are starting to gain upside momentum as i am writing this my home currency euro is up 0 81 on the day after breaking out of a downtrend at the end of november that was pretty much the start of the emerging dollar downtrend we are currently witnessing source tradingview the next graph shows both the dollar index in this case inverted and the price of oil black line the correlation is far from perfect but there is no denying the theory i discussed in this article is valid every major oil move is supported by dollar weakness as it adds fundamental fuel to often buying points at low prices in this case we see that oil has weakened since the summer of 2018 as the dollar index has gained significant strength now we are seeing a rebound after testing major support while the dollar is once again at a turning point source tradingview of course it is very tricky to predict an economic turning point in 2018 the call was right but the risks were lower by that i mean that a delayed economic decline is doing in most cases much less damage to your portfolio than being bullish too early this is the effect of selling later vs buying early and that s what this is about buying early or frontrunning the economic bottom so why murphy oil in general i am getting increasingly bullish on commodities in this case oil is my favorite commodity to trade not only because i like it but also because oil is highly driven by the dollar commodity cycle murphy oil is an el dorado ar based independent oil and gas producer worth 4 12 billion that employs slightly over 1 100 employees the company ipo ed in 1956 and has a large global offshore and north american onshore portfolio as of december 2019 the company s production consists of 54 crude oil 38 natural gas and 8 ngls natural gas liquids 37 of this mix is produced through us onshore operations 36 through canada onshore operations and just 27 in na offshore operations these numbers are after the acquisition of llog assets in the gulf of mexico worth 1 38 billion and divestment of malaysia drilling assets worth 2 13 billion one of the reasons behind the company s choice of assets is the aim to outperform wti oil prices most recent third quarter data shows that 94 of the company s production is selling at a premium to wti with oil at 56 45 this means that north american offshore is selling at a 4 per barrel premium eagle ford onshore is selling at a more than 2 premium per barrel speaking of eagle ford this basin and gulf mexico assets are receiving 75 of the company s capital as these assets are the most promising operating margin is at 52 per barrel in both regions as you can see below based on 56 45 wti source murphy oil investor presentation december 2019 gaap net income and gaap operating margin are both at new cycle highs while cash from operations has recovered nicely although still well below the previous highs due to divestitures and an overall changed business environment data by ycharts murphy oil praises itself with a large creation of shareholder value since 1962 the company has returned 6 3 billion to shareholders that s 108 million per year or 2 6 of the current market cap note that 4 4 billion of this amount was distributed in the past 10 years since 2012 the company has repurchased shares worth 1 6 billion and speaking of buybacks even to date the largest part of cash paid to shareholders comes from repurchases buybacks dividend growth has been flat over the past couple of years although this might sound bad it is not the company did cut dividend payments after the oil crash of 2014 2015 but always maintained a strong dividend flow as the middle part of the overview below shows the company has one of the highest dividend yields among its major peers this can be confirmed when you take a look at the overview from finviz anyhow buybacks make it even more interesting as the value of buybacks is often more than double the amount of dividends paid source murphy oil investor presentation december 2019 as a result the company is paying the highest dividend yield since the end of the prior century as you can see below adding to that throughout the first 3 quarters of this year the company has paid dividends worth 125 million and bought back shares worth 406 million this combined value of 531 million is 46 of total cash from operations according to my calculations based on sec data in the first three quarters of 2018 this ratio was at 21 back then operating cash flow was roughly half the size it was in 2019 but the company did not buy back any shares as the overview i just showed you already revealed data by ycharts you probably already guessed it but a conservative approach is exactly what murphy oil aims to achieve with regard to shareholder returns the company uses its profitable production platform to streamline production as lease operating costs per barrel have declined by 13 since the end of the second half of 2019 meanwhile eagle ford onshore production is up more than 22 since the end of q2 2019 which pushed overall oil production to the highest level since q1 2015 moving over to another topic i consider to be very important the financial situation even more than three years after the oil bottom we still see that a large number of oil companies have high leverage this is not always bad as it often supports the stock price when oil prices rapidly increase however when it comes to a dividend play i do not want high leverage as it tends to cause downswings to be steeper in case of murphy oil i am very satisfied with the results i found starting with liquidity the company is holding 435 million in cash technically speaking this is enough to repay 75 of accounts payable right now the current ratio is at a healthy value of 1 23 indicating that liquidity is not an issue right now the debt equity ratio is at 0 49 indicating healthy leverage levels roughly half of all liabilities consist of long term debt worth 2 8 billion the maturity profile of this debt load is healthy as 2 billion of this debt load is due prior to 2025 while the other 800 million is due between 2029 and 2042 in addition to that the company has an undrawn rcf revolving credit facility worth 1 6 billion the average fixed coupon payment is 5 5 the only thing i dislike is the fact that the stock has a beta of 2 13 and is roughly 5x more volatile than the s p 500 this is no surprise as the company is a cyclical energy company however i like low beta high safe dividend stocks in cases like these i adjust my trading investment size accordingly as the beta adjusted exposure would be much much higher if i made murphy oil the same size as my other investments takeaway murphy oil is one of the most interesting stocks and opportunities i have discussed in the fourth quarter the company is a great example of a successful turnaround after the oil crash of 2014 2015 the company has a very solid balance sheet a high and sustainable dividend yield and a very shareholder friendly distribution and buyback approach in addition to that i like the company s prospects as we are on the verge of what could be much higher oil prices i believe the economy has the potential to bottom in the first quarter of 2020 which could lead to a 2016 style recovery for oil stocks as a potentially weaker dollar will lift commodities and reduce the pressure on emerging markets i like that murphy just completed a very long double bottom pattern as it is currently recovering at a valuation of 31x next year s earnings that s not cheap but i believe subdued earnings expectations will rise if the bullish oil call turns out to be right source finviz i am looking to make this company a part of my dividend holdings however as i mentioned i will adjust the position for its higher than average beta as i do not like to buy too much volatility so to speak other than that i think we are looking at a very interesting risk reward opportunity that could turn into a huge winner in 2020 let me know what you think thank you very much for reading my article

liberalism at large the world according to the economist alexander zevin verso 34 95 cloth the economist is such a ubiquitous fixture of the global media that it is hard to appreciate how unusual it is is the economist liberalism at large or rather liberalism captured by the interests of the rich and powerful a weekly magazine or as it prefers to call itself a newspaper with a huge global reach it combines analytical longform journalism with an explicit political line where other publications might require tricky discursive analysis to decode the implicit biases that give their texts a distinctive ideological hue the economist has long told its readers exactly where it is coming from each issue opens with a series of editorials that review the issues of the day through the prism of a strong commitment to market liberalism and an aversion to protectionism socialism and isolationism this underlying philosophical outlook is not absent from the subsequent pages of anonymously authored reportage and commentary in this respect the economist is more like a journal of the socialist left than other conventional news outlets that faithfully project the verities and fears of the established order without acknowledging their theoretical commitments while its foundational political theory is one feature of the economist that sets it apart from analogous weekly publications such as newsweek or time a second is that it is edited from london it is a british media brand of world significance a living monument to britain s historical role as the pioneer of capitalism and the unique place of the city of london in the global economy and of course to the privileged status of english language publication in the twentieth century alexander zevin has therefore selected a wonderful subject to write about in his new book liberalism at large the world according to the economist analyzing a publication that is for the most part authored anonymously poses certain technical challenges for the historian but zevin has undertaken a tremendous amount of research to reconstruct the internal editorial life of the newspaper and the authorship of individual articles the result is on one level a brilliant narrative of the economist as a publication following the rise and fall of editors journalists and owners and at another level a compelling intellectual history of the liberal ideas that the newspaper has historically drawn on reshaped and amplified zevin is a historian and also one of the editors of new left review his book follows in that journal s tradition of never knowingly letting centrist liberals off the hook for their complicity in the myriad crimes of imperialism and capitalism zevin s charge sheet is certainly a lengthy and persuasive one as far as the contents of the economist go but by the end of the book there is room for disagreement about whether zevin is able to make all of the charges stick when he extends his argument beyond the economist as a historically specific publication to make a wider claim about the liberal tradition as a whole the economist was founded by the scottish businessman and banker james wilson in 1843 wilson established the economist to campaign for free trade just as the question of whether to repeal the corn laws became central to british politics the corn laws protected british agriculture from foreign competitors by levying tariffs on grain imports but it became a totemic issue that ran far beyond the technicalities of that particular policy to encompass wider disputes about industrialisation consumer interests and internationalism the forces of free trade duly triumphed with the repeal of the corn laws in 1846 but wilson was able to parlay the newspaper s initial positioning on this issue into a publication that offered its readers a bracing market liberalism characterised by unyielding resistance to labor market regulation state provision of public goods and franchise expansion the magazine s third editor and james wilson s son in law walter bagehot was the figure most responsible for crafting the economist s worldview bagehot originally wanted to become a liberal mp but lost four separate elections on the third occasion by only seven votes instead he became a famous victorian liberal sage still renowned today for his economic and constitutional commentaries bagehot carefully shepherded the economist to its almost preordained place as an eloquent advocate for the ascendant liberal party of the 1860s and 1870s while bagehot remained unconvinced of the merits of an overly permissive expansion of the franchise and wrote extensively instead about the merits of a british constitution that granted great power to the house of commons and strong cabinet government he indulged in some more radical thinking in his writings on economics struck by the vulnerability of the british economy to financial crises in the 1860s bagehot used the pages of the economist to agitate for a more interventionist model of central banking in which the bank of england would act as a lender of last resort bagehot s economist and preferred model of economic liberalism was therefore well placed to ally with the growing british financial services sector based in london while also offering firm support to any exercise of british military force deemed necessary to expand investment markets in asia and africa all of this might suggest a rather predictable narrative arc for the rest of the book but zevin shows that the subsequent story of the economist s editorial line is in fact more complicated than this initial starting point suggests zevin finds the economist s actually existing liberalism notable precisely because it sought to advance beyond the parameters of classical liberal doctrine as he tells it the economist engaged decisively with three crucial challenges to libertarian ideals in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries the enfranchisement of the working class the clash of rival imperialisms and the new financialized capitalism that gradually assumed control of the global economy one surprising twist in zevin s story is that in the twentieth century the economist was not always a trenchant exponent of untrammelled market forces nor even a particularly early advocate of neoliberalism during the 1970s indeed although zevin does not exactly say this his close scrutiny of the newspaper s editorial stance suggests a publication with a decided preference for shifting course with the prevailing wind zevin finds the economist s actually existing liberalism notable because it sought to advance beyond the parameters of classical liberal doctrine engaging with crucial challenges to libertarian ideals in the 1900s for example british liberalism famously embraced the politics of social welfare as leading liberal theorists and politicians sought to give the liberal party a more redistributive policy profile in keeping with the new mass working class though still entirely male electorate as zevin points out the economist played its part in this ideological refurbishment under the editorship of francis hirst in some ways hirst was an unlikely tribune of social liberalism insofar as his early writings offered a classical exposition of the benefits of free trade and fiscal retrenchment but he was also a fierce critic of expansionist british imperialism hirst s opposition to the 1899 1902 boer war drew him into an alliance with social liberal theorists such as leonard hobhouse and john hobson taking up the economist s editorship in 1907 shortly after the liberal party had returned to office in a landslide election victory in 1906 hirst positioned the newspaper as a supporter of that government s expansion of employment and health insurance as well as of its confrontational decision to increase direct taxation on the wealthy according to zevin the economist s allotted role in these struggles was to persuade the city and financial opinion that social reform measures could be pursued within the confines of orthodox budgetary management later under the editorships of walter layton and geoffrey crowther the economist of the 1930s and 1940s expressed a qualified acceptance of keynesian ideas william beveridge s famous 1942 report on social services the foundational document of a universal welfare state in britain was given a warm welcome by the newspaper as one of the most remarkable state documents ever drafted in fact the economist s keynesian commitments made it initially resistant to monetarism and the broader market liberal arguments that laid down firm roots in the right wing press in britain and around the world from the early 1970s onwards the economist s principal writer on economics in this period norman macrae shared with many neoliberals a robust critique of the postwar british state s economic strategy but unlike many of the journalists and intellectual outriders who would flock to margaret thatcher and ronald reagan macrae remained a believer in full employment as a policy goal the economist thus published increasingly baroque economic commentaries that tried to combine keynesian and neoliberal remedies culminating in a surprisingly equivocal endorsement of thatcher s successful conservative party in the 1979 general election in due time the economist learned from its mistake over the course of the 1980s it emerged as one of the staunchest media allies of the new neoliberal policy agenda popularized by thatcher and reagan the newspaper dutifully elected to go down with the ship in 1997 when it endorsed the conservative party even as tony blair s new labour swept into power offering a fresh historic compromise between thatcherism and social democracy in short the economist has repeatedly reflected prevailing orthodoxies rather than challenging them and it has not always been adept at spotting the right moment to jump from one piece of conventional wisdom to the next this does not seem to be the point that zevin wants to make but with respect to domestic economic and social policy it is fair to say that the economist has historically been an intellectually derivative publication historians looking to narrate the war of ideas in which new approaches to state intervention and then economic liberalization gained intellectual ascendancy would not on this showing necessarily turn to the economist as a key operational theater it is in the field of international relations and in particular the question of empire that zevin finds a more consistent ideological shape to the economist s journalism during a speech at his 2012 retirement party for example the longstanding foreign editor johnny grimond noted that during his forty year tenure the economist never saw a war it didn t like wilson and bagehot created a newspaper that firmly supported britain as an imperial power envisaging the economist as an explicit counterweight to those strands of british liberalism that saw free trade as an alternative to conquest and war with rival powers under hirst the economist briefly tacked toward this less militaristic stance after the outbreak of world war one the newspaper managed two years of forensic criticism of the war s destructive impact on liberal and humanitarian principles before its trustees could take no more and dismissed hirst in order to clear the way for a more enthusiastically pro war editor the crucial turning point in zevin s book is the economist s take on the fall of british imperialism and the rise of the new western geopolitical order underpinned by american might after 1945 the mid twentieth century saw an uneasy transition between an editorial line that clung to some illusions about britain s new status in world affairs and a more clear eyed acceptance of u s leadership the 1956 suez crisis when the united states unceremoniously halted the attempt by britain and france to seize back the recently nationalized suez canal from egypt seems to have been one key moment in reorienting the economist s view of geopolitics and clarifying where power really lay in the postwar world as it was for many figures in the british elite the economist took a strong line against the enterprise from the start in part because it was an act of unwarranted military aggression but crucially also because it jeopardized the anglo american alliance zevin depicts alastair burnet economist editor from 1965 until 1974 as the pivotal figure in confirming the newspaper s atlanticist turn while zevin paints vivid portraits of the personalities behind the economist s anonymous prose throughout the book his profiles of the staff after the 1960s are particularly illuminating burnet who remarkably combined the editor s day job with a role as anchor of a nightly news bulletin on itv presided over a generational change in the newspaper s staff that aligned it more clearly with the cold war and conservative politics in those years a new type of economist journalist came to the fore usually drawn from elite british universities as in previous years but now socialized into a more american frame of reference this was often a result of economist journalists studying or working in the united states at a formative moment in their lives but it also reflected the more general cultural prestige of the united states in britain after world war two this americanization of the british elite encompassed media outlets and politicians across the ideological spectrum but in the case of the economist we confront the intriguing spectacle of u s cold war liberalism being expertly repackaged by british writers and sold back to an admiring american audience under burnet s leadership for example the economist was a great advocate of the vietnam war chiding the british government for failing to offer more active military support to the united states s war effort more generally during the 1960s and 1970s the economist s pages came to purvey a grim cold war realism that simply backed every play of the united states regardless of whether this involved sponsorship of regimes that ignored the economist s liberal principles such as suharto s indonesia or demanded external intervention into elected governments deemed too far to the left such as salvador allende s chile the economist has maintained an unyielding defense of financialized capitalism to the present the financial times by contrast has recently sponsored far more diverse analyses of contemporary capitalism like the beatles who absorbed american musical traditions and then exported a revitalised version of them back to the united states the economist made it big across the atlantic by writing original material that was nonetheless rooted in recognizable american idioms in the economist s case it was the late 1970s and 1980s when sales really took off in the united states today zevin reports about half of the newspaper s circulation can be found in the united states and canada some 850 000 copies yet there is a twist to this story of an economist staff increasingly attracted to the merits of the u s model in that it also seems clear that the staff itself has often been more politically diverse than the newspaper s editorial line might lead one to believe zevin quotes an anonymous senior editor who intriguingly told him that in recent decades the editor s role has been to pull a center or even center left staff to the right zevin doesn t make very much of this he presumably sees such ideological distinctions in the center of politics as relatively unimportant but it does underline that the economist s desire to project a corporate view has made it averse even to expressing the full range of opinion among its staff the financial times by contrast has sponsored far more diverse analyses of contemporary capitalism in recent years the larger argument of zevin s book is that a close reading of the economist tells us what liberalism is really like as an operational ideology as opposed to a set of abstract political principles this is not necessarily because he sees the economist as representative of the broad liberal tradition zevin meticulously acknowledges the complex varieties of liberal ideology over the last two centuries rather it is because he thinks the economist has simply been much more influential in propagating its preferred variant of liberalism than other liberal publications or thinkers a close reading of the economist tells us what liberalism is really like as an operational ideology as opposed to a set of abstract political principles the economist he argues uniquely combines historical longevity access to elite decision makers and opinion formers and a much higher global circulation than any rival publication with over 1 5 million print or digital copies sold per week as zevin concludes in considering that success ideas have mattered most in other words the economist brand has succeeded because it has offered an authoritative practical guide to liberals seeking to navigate their way through the thorny policy dilemmas of a modernity that does not resemble an idealised classical individualism but is this too idealist an account of the global ascent of the economist it is perhaps an impertinent question to ask of a book avowedly written in the marxist tradition but zevin provides plenty of evidence to sustain a more materialist interpretation of the economist s history here we encounter a final theme of the book the long running entanglement between the newspaper and the city of london the economist has been a consistent supporter of finance in general but it rose to prominence as a commentator on and doughty defender of london s burgeoning specialization in financial services such as banking the stock market and currency exchange the apotheosis of this stance was reached after the 2008 financial crash when as zevin puts it the economist acted as a kind of automatic stabilizer for a liberal ideological order suddenly racked with self doubt while some advocates of capitalism were reflective about what the crisis revealed about the complex relationship between states and markets the economist under the editorship of john micklethwait 2006 2014 instead leaned in to its traditional affinity with the city of london emerging as a rather uncritical advocate of the producer interests of the international financial services sector indeed the familiar critique that our economic system offers socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor was vividly illustrated by economist editorials that demanded unqualified public subsidy for the banks followed by a regime of regressive public austerity to defray the costs the economist has maintained this unyielding defense of financialized capitalism to the present a recent issue summarized the doubts of some economists about how severely income and wealth inequalities have increased since the 1980s in order to cast doubt on the necessity of adopting radical new egalitarian policies such as elizabeth warren s wealth tax better the economist insisted to tackle such inequality as there may be through perennial market liberal panaceas such as stronger antitrust policies the deregulation of entry to highly paid professions and greater levels of high skilled immigration it is striking that the cultural weight of the economist has grown exponentially since the 1980s the very period in which global capitalism has made itself more dependent on growth from an expanding finance sector is the economist therefore liberalism at large or rather liberalism captured by the interests of the rich and

from slashing the refugee cap to weakening climate policy here are some of the things trump did last year that you may have missed washington dc it was another turbulent year for us president donald trump from the conclusion of the fbi investigation into allegations his 2016 campaign colluded with russia to his impeachment trump may have spent as much time defending his presidency and actions as he did governing in 2019 but there were also many decisions his administration made that did not get as much attention here are the top 10 things the trump administration did that you may have missed 1 top adviser with white nationalist ties stephen miller a top adviser to trump has been a driving force behind trump s immigration policies a former senate aide miller joined trump s campaign early in the primary season and has helped shape much of the administration s domestic policies miller is considered one of the architects of trump s so called muslim ban which prohibits the entry into the us of citizens from five muslim majority countries iran libya somalia syria and yemen and restricts a small number of north koreans and venezuelans from coming into the country he was also one of the main proponents of the us s practice of separating undocumented migrant children from their parents at the us southern border but miller has also been accused of having ties to white nationalist organisations according to a november investigative report by the southern poverty law center splc a us based watchdog group prior to taking the white house job miller regularly sent reporters links to white supremacist groups as research to back his arguments on immigration this included a number of emails sent to right wing website breitbart a white house official defended miller saying he hates bigotry in all forms despite calls from members of congress to fire him the splc report came a few months after an underreported incident when the department of justice doj sent out an email to employees with a link to a white nationalist organisation a doj official said the email was a mistake the daily eoir morning news briefings are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included the official said 2 nuclear technology to saudi arabia as the us persistently shakes its finger at iran and north korea for attempting to develop a nuclear weapons programme it quietly okayed the sale of nuclear technology and expertise to saudi arabia which plans to build at least two nuclear power plants in march reports revealed that the us had secretly approved six authorisations for companies to sell nuclear power technology to saudi arabia but as tensions simmer between the saudi kingdom and its regional rival iran there is widespread concern that sharing nuclear technology with riyadh could lead to a nuclear arms race in the middle east concerns were compounded after saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman mbs said in a 2018 interview that he would develop nuclear arms if iran did trump meanwhile has been exercising a maximum pressure campaign against iran after he withdrew the us from a 2015 nuclear pact that curbed iran s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief read more here 3 trump replaces obama era climate change plan trump ran on a campaign promise to overturn environmental restrictions on major industries put in place by his predecessor barack obama trump has been particularly vocal in his protection of the coal industry public enemy number one for many environmentalists when it comes to fighting climate change in june the trump administration officially ended the clean power plan cpp put in place by the obama administration in 2015 cpp aimed to slash power plant carbon emissions by more than a third by 2030 by pushing utilities to drop coal in favour of cleaner fuels like natural gas solar and wind power the trump administration argued it was an example of overregulation restricting american companies ability to compete globally it replaced cpp with the affordable clean energy rule which does not curb rising carbon emissions from power plants and prolongs the operation of coal plants twenty two states are now suing the federal government arguing it prolongs us reliance on coal power and obstructs states that pursue cleaner electricity generation the coal lobbyists and climate deniers running the trump administration wrote every word of this illegal and dangerous rule argued massachusetts attorney general maura healey one of the state officials leading the lawsuit in november the environmental protection agency took trump s plan one step further by announcing it wants to roll back regulations on waste from coal plants sparking fears that small communities around the us would be more vulnerable to adverse health effects read more here 4 ig says state department targeted employee over ethnic background the state department s inspector general issued a report in november that found an employee of the department was improperly removed from her post by officials over her ethnic background perceived political views and prior role in the obama administration sahar nowrouzzadeh is a state department security specialist who was born in connecticut but whose parents immigrated from iran the report found that employees in the administration had circulated conservative news articles with false claims that she was born in iran and was a muslim spy nowrouzzadeh was demoted by the department under the guidance of us special representative for iran brian hook who denied the decision was based on her background but the ig drew a different conclusion and recommended discipline for a number of high ranking state department officials the report is the second by the ig on the topic of political retaliation an earlier report in august found that two trump appointed officials had routinely disparaged career employees for their perceived political opinions and work for the previous administration 5 trump slashes us refugee cap trump has made slashing immigration a central focus of his presidency and re election campaign the number of refugees admitted into the us has hit historic lows since he took office in the 2019 fiscal year 30 000 refugees were admitted in the country a record low and the state department announced in september that it will cap the number of refugees allowed in the country in 2020 at 18 000 the lowest number since the resettlement programme was created in 1980 the trump administration also granted states and counties the right to block any refugee resettlements within their jurisdiction officials said there are too many cases for courts and agents to handle the overwhelming backlog is completely unsustainable and needs to be addressed before we accept large numbers of refugees a white house statement said read more here 6 middle east peace summit in bahrain trump s plan to negotiate a peace deal between palestinians and israelis has stalled repeatedly since he took office in february 2017 trump stood with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu at the white house and promised we ll be working on it very very diligently he put his son in law and top adviser jared kushner on the case since then kushner has travelled to the region multiple times the trump administration has unveiled a 50bn economic plan to end the decades old conflict between israelis and palestinians in june kushner opened a two day conference in bahrain to rally support for the plan which expects donor nations and investors to contribute funds towards projects in the occupied palestinian territories as well as jordan egypt and lebanon palestinian leaders rejected the plan and boycotted the conference accusing it of pro israel bias after it shut down its consulate in jerusalem and ordered the palestinian mission in washington dc to close earlier in 2019 the us cut all aid to the palestinian territories critics say kushner s attempt to decide economic priorities first while initially sidestepping politics ignores the realities of the conflict the political portion of the peace plan has not been released read more here 7 pushing south korea to china the us has held troops in south korea since the ceasefire between north and south korea in 1953 in 1991 washington and seoul signed the special measures agreement sma which lays out how the two countries cover the costs associated with protecting the korean peninsula the sma was scheduled to expire at the end of 2019 and trump reportedly took the opportunity to increase the price tag in august 2019 trump tweeted that south korea was not paying its fair share in november talks between the two countries over burden sharing broke down after the us reportedly asked for five times the amount from seoul to keep american troops there that same week south korea signed an agreement with china for more military cooperation pushing a close us ally towards a us adversary 8 conflict of interest woes trump a former businessman often compares the running of government to running a business but he has repeatedly come under fire for using his position as president to promote his businesses many of which bear his name on them in september the us air force came under scrutiny after it was revealed that crews had been staying at trump s scottish resort in turnberry during stopovers ignoring cheaper options a pentagon investigation concluded the stays were within guidelines in october another report surfaced he was pushing to have the g7 summit at his golf resort in doral florida trump cancelled the plan after significant backlash but was puzzled over why it was such a big deal i was willing to do this for free trump told reporters during a cabinet meeting he used the meeting to rail against what he calls this phony emoluments clause an article in the us constitution that forbids the president from accepting gifts or emoluments from foreign leaders while in office in july a federal appeals court threw out an emoluments case against him that argued profits from his washington hotel were a violation of the clause 9 trump signs hong kong legislation the thanksgiving holiday in the us is a good time for presidential administrations to bury news in november trump used the holiday to sign the hong kong human rights and democracy act the legislation passed by congress followed months of mass pro democracy protests that rattled the chinese government the legislation threatens to bar entry of individuals who violate internationally recognised human rights but the legislation also put trump in a political bind it came as the us and china held talks on a possible trade deal beijing said it seriously interfered with hong kong affairs seriously interfered with china s internal affairs and seriously violated international law and basic norms of international relations trump said he supported the pro democracy protesters but china was a friend the legislation also passed with veto proof majorities in both houses of congress 10 debt and deficit grow as a businessman candidate for the white house in 2016 trump promised to use his experience to get rid of the national debt within eight years if elected but as president the us national debt has soared in january 2017 when trump took office the debt hovered around 19 trillion as of december 2019 that total is just over 23 trillion a 21 percent increase the federal deficit continues to grow with massive spending on the us military causing a large portion of it in 2019 the deficit was its biggest in seven years with an even bigger one projected in 2020 trump promised a 2017 tax cut would help pay down the debt and deficit as the economy improved

january 1 does not just mark a new year it also marks a new decade to put that into context look back at the last decade as 2009 rolled into 2010 the dow jones industrial closed 10 428 05 on dec 31 2009 on tuesday it closed at 28 538 44 the nasdaq at the end of the last decade closed at 2269 15 the tech heavy exchange ended the year at 8 972 60 ten years ago at this time there were no ipads under any christmas trees it didn t debut until january of 2010 multi use rockets to space were science fiction until november of 2015 thanks to blue origin and spacex which have re ignited the space race then there are things that are no longer with us in 2013 the days of trips to blockbuster ended as the last of the retail stores were shut down though one store remains pontiac once ruled the roads but in 2010 general motors put the brakes on the brand with franchise agreements for dealers expiring on halloween it was no trick or treat so what s ahead for 2020 we asked some of fox business network anchors and correspondents to weigh in with picks predictions or prognostications for 2020 cheryl casone anchor fbn am looking ahead to 2020 i think there are three things to really watch for first it s obviously an election year and as we get more into the rhetoric about taxes and the economy i think we re going to have to really start to dig deep down and analyze what these candidates have to say the big thing will be of course the result of that election in november wall street will be watching i think president trump wins based on the economy stock market action after 2020 election sweep might surprise you second there s been so much talk about a recession in 2020 especially in the first quarter i do not see that happening my prediction is the market and the economy will continue to be strong of course it is always nice to see a small pullback and maybe we will get that at some point in the year but i just don t see it happening in january or february third i ll be keeping an eye on the jobs picture it s been great to see unemployment at a 50 year low but my prediction for 2020 is that we re finally going to see wages meaningfully head higher companies are doing better and they will start to pay their employees better in 2020 the 10 biggest business stories in 2019 neil cavuto anchor cavuto coast to coast impeachment remains likely to be a major news event in the new year but that doesn t mean it will be a business news event to watch in the new year for all the hype and polarizing attention markets have ignored this long and sorted political saga investors are taking it as a given the president s impeachment goes no further than the house of representatives with a quick and likely unceremonious end in the senate that s why it s not on wall street s radar here are some of the things that will be if 2019 ended as the year of the trade tease 2020 will be the year we discover whether the tease lived up to the hype by then we should not only know the details of trade agreements but whether the countries with whom we ve agreed to them will honor them remember there are two big accords we re talking about the one with china and the other with mexico and canada neither are slam dunks the mexicans are still protesting u s labor inspectors in their country monitoring compliance and the chinese have yet to spell out when and how many agricultural goods they ll buy from the u s and during what time period that means despite the hype no one has yet to sign off on the details that remain alarmingly vague forget the heated political election year when it comes to bashing technology expect both parties to be preaching and railing from the same choir sheet democrats and republicans are oddly united on bringing the tech giants down a peg or two democrats argue these companies have simply become too big for their britches and should be broken up republicans led by president trump say their content is so skewed and biased that they need to be fundamentally realigned that likely means some de fanging for the fang stocks and some non fang stocks as well including facebook amazon google and possibly apple what better time to make a political bashing statement than slap dab in the middle of a presidential election year watch this one closely there s a reason why big tech should feel like general custer they really are surrounded housing will get hotter in 2020 i didn t say hot just hotter and the difference will be younger namely millennial buyers coming in helping to reestablish a domino of events that could lift the entire real estate sector the sudden surge in younger buyer interest has picked up considerable steam in just the last few months if it holds and i suspect it will it stands to reverse the sluggish dynamic that has been holding housing back hurt at the lower end by a lack of buyers and a general lack of interest assuming interest rates remain low and job growth remains strong and the millennial foot traffic picks up expect all this to feed on itself and up the housing food chain particularly along the coasts but not just the coasts cities including nashville tenn and rochester n y have been marked as undervalued buys they are among some of the more price friendly and tax friendly locales that stand to see the most buyer interest that doesn t mean booming interest but most in

with china and economic data that had so called experts proudly proclaiming a looming recession for america they were wrong dow gains 10 000th point since trump s election the most hated bull market in history began in march of 2009 and has taken markets relentlessly higher it s the best performing bull market since world war ii in fact remarkably the s p 500 has gained more than 470 percent during that time i believe this will continue in 2020 the u s economy remains solid a trade deal with china will continue in phases and wall street believes the democrat s socialist agenda will put donald trump s market friendly administration back in the white house for another four years there is still plenty of cash still sitting on the sidelines that will provide more fuel to push stocks

passive federal reserve and this bull run will have plenty of legs in 2020 enjoy the ride and see your retirement accounts grow a 5g world like everyone else i m intrigued and expectant to see what a 5g world looks and feels like we ll find out in 2020 i m far from a tech expert but i know that 5g stands for fifth generation cellular wireless according to the hype 5g will provide greater download speeds up to five to ten times faster than 4g lte we can also expect much improved video streaming and the ability to connect more devices to the network it will also have big implications for other products that rely on network connections everything from virtual reality to autonomous vehicles in short 2019 will be known as the network stone age for investors 5g will offer some interesting

according to goldman sachs big tech has been the very backbone of the bull market in fact apple alone has contributed 20 percentage points of the s p 500 total return microsoft has added 17 percent and amazon 9 percent analysts say it s worrying that just a handful of stocks are carrying so much of the upward impetus but it s impossible to ignore the size and power of these companies and difficult to bet against them i ll be expecting these same tech behemoths to post impressive gains but there is a caveat until regulations hurt the business models of these companies it appears negative news such as data breaches do little to hurt the stock price but i think regulation comprehensive regulation is on the horizon europe has already thrown down the gauntlet with its general data protection regulation or gdpr it s designed to improve the data protection rights of users and clarifies what companies must do to safeguard those rights google to acquire wearable tech maker fitbit for 2 1b the regulations went into effect in may of 2018 and while protecting users it has hurt european business according to merrill corporation 55 percent of m a professionals surveyed said they had worked on transactions that failed because of compliance issues with gdpr another survey by bitkom in germany showed 75 percent believed that data protection requirements are the main obstacle to the development of technologies i only mention this because too often there are unintended consequences to well intentioned regulations and as u s lawmakers set their sights on big tech

the horizon by kayodek omolafe kayode komolafe thisdaylive com at last attorney general abubakar malami took a wise step last tuesday in ordering the state security service sss to comply with court orders by releasing from custody colonel sambo dasuki and mr omoyele sowore well it is better late than never as they say but it could have been a wiser thing to do if the chief law officer of the federation had elected to comply with court orders to use his exact words some months or even years ago especially in the dasuki case it is certainly less than wise that the administration of president muhammadu buhari chose to obey the law only after it had needlessly inflicting upon itself enormous public relations disaster as dr reuben abati aptly put it on this page some weeks ago strident voices from within and without have risen unison to warm against nigerian s descent into authoritarianism and an egregious assault on human freedom for instance not a few observers of the nigerian scene must have noted that just a few days before malami took action a group of american legislators had addressed to him a strongly worded petition in respect of the sowore case the congressmen said we are deeply concerned that established legal procedure and the rule of law are not being followed in his case more significantly was that regardless of what malami may say now internal pressures are mounting against the tendency towards authoritarian rule a groundswell of opinions is already building against reckless disobedience of court orders and official lawlessness even from otherwise reticent quarters warnings are issued against a recipe for anarchy which the assault on the rule of law squarely represents it is commendable that forces of genuine democracy are awake to see the reality that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty unwittingly human rights abuse has been added to the list of the nation s challenges which include mass poverty insecurity and youth joblessness the tangible problems of bad roads and bridges along with epileptic power supply and physical insecurity may not actually define the administration in democratic terms instead what buhari does or fails to do in the intangible realms of human freedom and national integration might be the ultimate defining factors after all some of the monumental bridges and roads in nigeria were constructed during military dictatorship so roads bridges and boreholes are not necessarily dividends of democracy it is the respect for human freedom that is the real dividend of democracy to read the direction of the buhari administration in these terms is at least consistent with liberal democratic ethos the public sphere is suffused with liberal thinking on the implication of curtailment of human freedom under any guise for those who might like to discount the question of freedom in the race for development when such a logic prevailed in the past it had tragic consequences this is possibly why the yale historian professor timothy snyder asserts that history does not repeat itself but it does instruct history can familiarize and it can warn a lot of admonition against attack on freedom is embodied in his on tyranny twenty lessons from the twentieth century up till his demise eminent economist professor sam aluko told anyone who cared to listen to him that there was a sound logic to economic management under the maximum ruler general sani abacha some even refer to some efforts of the petroleum trust fund ptf under the leadership of general buhari while economic historians may continue to debate aluko s proposition there is however no argument that the regime of general abacha was largely defined by the grand assault on human freedom and the shrinking of the democratic space it is precisely because of the centrality of freedom to development that those strategising for the buhari administration should take seriously the mounting opposition to abuse of human rights and disrespect for the rule of law this should be of interest particularly to the economic advisers of the administration as they think about holistic development for the country in fact the 1998 winner of the nobel prize in economics amartya sen actually equates development with freedom in his work development as freedom according to sen development efforts mean the removal of various types of unfreedoms that leave people with little choice and little opportunity of exercising their reasoned agency among the limiting factors to freedom identified by sen are poverty as well as tyranny poor economic opportunities as well as systematic social deprivation neglect of public facilities as well as intolerance or over activity of repressive states while federal security agents descend heavily on protesters some state governments charge their critics with terrorism and all kinds of crimes in the book under a previous administration buhari himself and his running mate in a presidential election the late senator chuba okadigbo led a public protest against alleged electoral manipulation the sensibilities of decent people were assaulted when the police teargassed the protesters the protesters went to court and the court upheld the constitutional rights of citizens to protest the court said the police should protect the protesters rather than molest them the court indeed affirmed the proposition of the legend fela anikulapo kuti that human rights constitute a property of the people and not a dash it is therefore one of the huge ironies of nigeria s political history that the police harass citizens asserting their democratic rights to protest under buhari s watch the president has proclaimed his conversion to liberal democracy he should prove the skeptics wrong by making strict adherence to the rule of law a central part of his agenda depending on the competence in economic management he may be ultimately vindicated on the huge loans to build roads railways and bridges at the objective level however what is happening at the more subjective realm may actually define his administration in a more enduring way this includes his disposition to human freedom fostering national unity and strengthening the moral fabric of the society it is time the president began to ponder how his administration would be defined when all would be history even on january 1 2024 lest we forget by issa aremu there was no dull moment in the political economy of nigeria in 2019 recalling my reflections in 2019 actually passes for another word counts of reflection no dull moment more for the better than the worse of special importance was the remarkable innovative corporate governance of cbn whoever fails to plan is planning to fail goes the popular received wisdom as it is for human beings so for public institutions and indeed nation states in 2019 cbn emerged as the singular institution that commendably sets corporate agenda for the next five years of the second tenure of its governor mr godwin emefiele is the 11th governor of the apex bank appointed by former president goodluck jonathan in 2014 he was rightly reappointed by president muhammadu buhari for another 5 years term in 2018 after eventful five years of what i perceive as activist autonomous central banking emefiele announced a renewed vision for the next tenure in his words put succinctly our priorities at the cbn over the next 5 years are the following first preserve domestic macroeconomic and financial stability second foster the development of a robust payments system infrastructure that will increase access to finance for all nigerians thereby raising the financial inclusion rate in the country third continue to work with the deposit money banks to improve access to credit for not only small holder farmers and msmes but also consumer credit and mortgage facilities for bank customers our intervention support shall also be extended to our youth population who possess entrepreneurship skills in the creative industry fourth grow our external reserves and fifth support efforts at diversifying the economy through our intervention programs in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors we are confident that when implemented these measures will help to insulate our economy from potential shocks in the global economy in my second term in office part of my pledge is to work to the best of my abilities in fulfilling these objectives will other public institutions be audacious to set agenda in 2020 upon which we can hold them accountable precisely because i was involved i bear witness that with respect to intervention in manufacturing sector cbn s measures had renewed hope of the revival of cotton textile and garment sectors ctg policy nigeria for once is moving from the old era of perennial cotton shortage to cotton surplus thanks to cbn s creative supports for cotton farmers in katsina and other cotton growing centers through improved seedlings and credits understandably stakeholders in the renewed drive to re industrialize nigeria praised cbn for the restrictions of sale of forex to importers read smugglers of textiles into the country this is one singular praise for the cbn governor not too much the central bank of nigeria on tuesday march 5 2019 at its meeting with stakeholders in the cotton textile garment value chain in abuja listed all forms of textile materials among items prohibited from foreign exchange in the official windows there is also an historic memorandum of understanding mou facilitated by the bank between uniformed services army police civil defense customs service and textile manufacturers the mou envisages production of the service uniforms by local textile firms in line with presidential executive order 003 the year 2019 was also the year of elections we can debate the quality of elections especially in kogi and bayelsa but nigeria democratically transited at federal and many states kwara election was the most nationally adjudged free and fair under the otoge movement it was indeed a revolution made possible through voters cards and vote counts not by some instant proclamation from the streets also last year on the 16th of may at the plenary the senate passed the amendment to an act in concurrence with the house of representatives which approved the new date of june 12th as new democracy day earlier in december 2018 following the adoption of a report by senator ahmad lawan the majority leader for the senate to concur with the house the bill was passed almost one year after president muhammadu buhari announced that the date would replace may 29 for nigerians to commemorate the return to the civilian government that singular presidential action closed the chapter of june 12 saga with as many as 85 million registered voters in quantitative terms nigeria remains a democracy destination but this democracy needs quality control that must start with issues based politics of development and productivity as opposed to politics of corruption and violence in november president muhammadu buhari accented to the new deep offshore and inland basin production sharing contract act it was what i called a smart patriotic economic move from above this singular amendment of the deep offshore act for once commendably balanced the age long corporate greed in oil and gas sector with urgent national needs in terms of revenue nigeria henceforth would receive it s fair rightful and equitable share of income from its oil and gas hitherto made impossible with the old law that kept oil taxes to the barest minimum disregarding the upward swing in oil prices the deep offshore and inland basin production sharing contracts act was last enacted on march 23 1999 with its commencement backdated to january 1 1993 the provisions of the act stipulate that the law shall be subject to review to ensure that if the price of crude oil at any time exceeds 20 per barrel even when prices were in triple digits decades after the share of the revenue to the nigerian government shall be adjusted under the psc the new amendment promised to enhance national benefits from the non renewable oil and gas resources at international level 2019 marked the centenary of international labour organization ilo a century long ilo remains the principal centre of authority in the international system on labour and social policy ilo has come of age with 100 years of rich history in promotion of peace and social justice in the world of work as part of the ilo centenary activities nigeria for once played host to the director general of the ilo guy ryder at a global summit on youth employment creation in abuja worthy of recalling is also the fact that after addictive medical trips to singapore robert gabriel mugabe rgm on september 6 2019 heaved the last breath at 95 years in 2019 foreign policy observers also hailed the proactive historic visit of president muhammadu buhari to south africa between october 2 to 4 2019 both leaders rightly damned xenophobic violence and the reprisals the two presidents also directed their foreign affairs ministers to give practical expression to the early warning mechanism for prevention and monitoring platform nigeria and south africa also agreed to exchange a list of frequent travelers notable business people and academics to facilitate the issuance of long term multiple entry visas for 10 years nigeria looks forward to an eventful 2020 the year late president musa yar adua envisaged that nigeria would be one of the leading 10 developed countries of course nigeria missed out on all the 8 goals set for millennium development agenda that elapsed in 2015 will nigeria meet the new sustainable development goals sdgs of 2030 which is just a decade to go from today happy 2020 issa aremu mni is a renowned labour leader

beijing reuters china s central bank said on wednesday it was cutting the amount of cash that all banks must hold as reserves releasing around 800 billion yuan 114 91 billion in funds to shore up the slowing economy the people s bank of china pboc said on its website it will cut banks reserve requirement ratio rrr by 50 basis points effective jan 6 the move would bring the level for big banks down to 12 5 the pboc has now cut rrr eight times since early 2018 to free up more funds for banks to lend as economic growth slows to the weakest pace in nearly 30 years many investors had expected beijing to announce more support measures soon while recent data has shown signs of improvement and beijing and washington have agreed to de escalate their long trade war analysts are unsure if either will prove sustainable and forecast growth will cool further this year the rrr cut will help boost investor confidence and support the economy which is gradually steadying said wen bin an economist at minsheng bank in beijing who also expects another cut in china s new loan prime rate lpr this month premier li keqiang raised expectations of an imminent rrr cut in a speech in late december saying authorities were considering more measures to lower financing costs for smaller companies including broad based and targeted rrr reductions aimed at helping more vulnerable parts of the economy freeing up more liquidity now would also reduce the risks of a credit crunch ahead of the long lunar new year holidays later this month when demand for cash surges record debt defaults and problems at some smaller banks have already added to strains on china s financial system the pboc said it expects total liquidity in the banking system to remain stable ahead of the lunar new year of the latest funds released small and medium banks would receive roughly 120 billion yuan the central bank said stressing that it should be used to fund small local businesses the pboc said lower reserve requirements will reduce banks annual funding costs by 15 billion yuan which could reduce pressure on their profit margins from recent interest rate reforms last week it said existing floating rate loans will be switched to the new benchmark rate starting from jan 1 as part of a broader effort to lower financing costs analysts at nomura had forecast the pboc would deliver a system wide 50 bps cut in the rrr before the holidays together with an added reduction for some smaller banks analysts say the u s china phase one trade deal expected to be signed this month will relieve only some of the pressure weighing on the chinese economy which has also been weighed down by sluggish domestic and global demand slowing investment and weakening business confidence china plans to set a lower economic growth target of around 6 in 2020 relying on increased state infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown policy sources said growth has cooled from 6 8 in 2017 to 6 in the third quarter of 2019 the slowest since the early 1990s more policy easing seen smaller private firms have been particularly hard hit as regulators clamped down on riskier types of financing and debt despite beijing s urging commercial banks have been reluctant to lend to such firms as they are considered bigger credit risks than state owned firms in recent months china has also started to make modest cuts in major policy lending rates to lower corporate financing costs with more expected in the new year tang jianwei a senior economist at bank of communications in shanghai expects two to three rrr cuts this year and a further 25 30 bps reduction in the loan prime rate but officials have repeatedly pledged not to resort to flood like stimulus like that in past economic downturns which left a mountain of debt and stoked fears of property market bubbles

manifesto kudos to the wall street journal for compiling the above list warren s manifesto is remarkably similar to uk labour leader jeremy corbyn s manifesto i case you missed it corbyn went down in spectacular flames on december 12 i commented labour slaughtered corbyn refuses to admit he is the reason flashback november 18 fear of corbyn outweighs fear of brexit my comment this election is no longer primarily about brexit it s primarily about corbyn let s discuss just a few of warren s radical ideas wealth tax as the wsj points out such a tax would be unconstitutional that does not stop radical marxists from proposing them medicare for all and free stuff the obvious problem with medicare for all is there are no cost controls the same applies to 14 right to child care and 14 free college when there are zero cost controls prices are guaranteed to soar out of sight who is going to pay rest assured someone has to pay for all this free stuff even the leftist uk party figured this out when they trounced corbyn independents and moderates will be highly unlikely to support marxist nutcases democratic national polls rcp poll averages the more warren talks the more radical she sounds and the more support for her drops warren s blatant capitalist to my bones lie unlike warren jeremy corbyn at least admits he is a marxist on that point corbyn is at least honest elizabeth warren made one of the biggest most obvious lies in political history when she boldly stated she described herself as capitalist to my bones warren vs bernie sanders in response to obvious lies bernie sanders blasted capitalist to her bones warren elizabeth warren has been a friend of mine for some 25 years sanders said and i think she is a very very good senator but there are differences between elizabeth and myself elizabeth i think as you know has said that she is a capitalist through her bones i m not yet bernie proposes many of the same free things and bernie admits as much he added that they have a somewhat but not quite the same policy outlook how to pay for free things unlike warren bernie does not propose radical ways to pay for free things presumably under bernie s manifesto free things pay for themselves which any thinking person knows is crazy but warren has the additional disadvantage of scaring anyone who can read or spot obvious liars this explains her drop in the polls

as the year ended a partial and brief ceasefire seems imminent in donald trump s trade war on the world but make no mistake the protectionist impulse behind the trade war remains as ineradicable as ever nor should it be forgotten that economic nationalism has guided the destiny of all major nations since the 19th century according to the ideological prejudices of the present built up over nearly four decades of globalisation free trade and deregulation represent the natural order of things history however tells us that the us was a protectionist power for much of its existence and the tariff was a crucial factor in its dethronement of britain as global economic leader by the early 20th century as william mckinley put it in 1890 we lead all nations in agriculture we lead all nations in mining we lead all nations in manufacturing these are the trophies which we bring after 29 years of a protective tariff the argument for economic nationalism against a manufacturing giant such as britain was simple british free traders claimed that their ideology was best placed to bring prosperity and peace to the world their critics in countries less economically advanced than britain such as germany s friedrich list the 19th century s most influential economic theorist argued that free trade could only be a goal rather than the starting point of modern development barriers in place economic self strengthening for nations required that they protect their nascent industry until it becomes internationally competitive notwithstanding britain s rhetoric which periodicals like the economist amplified it had arrived at free trade after a successful policy of tariffs it also used military power to acquire foreign markets for its surplus goods and capital in the late 19th century one aspiring power after another set out to match the british the americans were not alone italy while seeking to modernise its economy imposed massive tariffs on france germany and japan nurtured domestic manufactures while trying to shield them from foreign competition even britain following its settler colonies australia canada and south africa came to abandon free trade by 1932 the us protectionism peaked with the infamous smoot hawley tariff act of 1930 a reluctant nod to free trade the us moved swiftly to embrace free trade after the second world war only because its manufacturing industries dominant over the world s war ravaged economies needed access to international markets even then the cold war s military and diplomatic urgencies turned the us into an unlikely protector of japan s manufacturing industries as they were rebuilt into world beaters trade practices of the kind deemed unfair by trump today ranging from loans and subsidies to national conglomerates and restriction of imports were key to the rise of not only japan but also such east asian tigers as south korea and taiwan india s high wall trying albeit much less successfully to build a manufacturing economy india imposed some of the world s highest tariffs after a short lived experiment with trade liberalisation which resulted in a 53 billion trade deficit with china india today has retreated into its old protectionist crouch it is hard to see what else it can do the rise of china as a manufacturing powerhouse has made even the us renounce the posture of international cooperation it assumed after the second world war the multilateral institutions such as the world trade organisation that the us helped set up no longer seem to serve its purposes moreover the argument first widely heard in the u during the debate over nafta in the 1990s that free trade enriches the wealthy at the expense of the poor and the middle class not to mention the environment has become politically much more potent might gets its way it is clear today that the advocates of free trade ignored for too long the volatile political problems rising from wage stagnation and income inequality upholding the economic law of comparative advantage they also managed to downplay the higher law that governs international economic relations might is right following the british imperialism of free trade powerful countries have consistently practised what they denounce in others for instance the us while insisting that other countries reduce state intervention has nurtured high tech industries in ways that violate wto agreements and which are shielded from sanction only by the fig leaf of defence requirements the bluff of free trade first called in the 19th century by an industrialising america against britain lies exposed yet again as china aspires to be the 21st century s new hegemon free trade turns out to be something that helps a rising great power until it doesn t and which most countries claim to practice while trying to subvert its principles as much as possible
iran had a rough year in 2019 and the new year is quite likely to bring just as many difficulties to the door of the islamic republic iran came under increased pressure in the previous 12 months led by a u s campaign of maximum pressure that included devastating sanctions that are now in their second year in reaction to the pressure tehran shifted away from its stated policy of strategic patience and pushed back with a series of calibrated actions that included disrupting security in the strategic strait of hormuz the major route for world oil supplies washington s imposition of a full line of sanctions in november 2018 targeted iran s key economic spheres including the banking and oil sectors and denied the government its main source of revenue while making international trade increasingly difficult in may 2019 washington upped the ante by ending waivers to the countries that were major buyers of iranian oil leading to a significant drop in the country s oil exports to fewer than 500 000 barrels per day that total has continued to tumble in recent months and brought total oil revenue to a trickle of what it once was dire straits the sanctions have driven away foreign investors and have contributed to a precipitous fall in the iranian currency the rial and a major shrinking of the economy which the international monetary fund predicts will have contracted by a whopping 9 5 percent over the course of 2019 the dire economic straits within iran were highlighted in a january speech by president hassan rohani who said iran was facing its biggest economic challenge since the 1979 islamic revolution iran s troubles were sharpened in november by violent protests triggered by a significant state enforced hike in the price of gasoline the outbreak of demonstrations against the price increase spread to at least 100 cities and towns nationwide where many protesters chanted slogans against iran s top political and religious leaders poverty and state corruption while banks government buildings and police cars were set alight amid the protesters rage the government responded with full force at least 308 people were killed according to amnesty international thousands injured and some 7 000 were detained according to a lawmaker reuters reported anonymous government officials saying some 1 500 people had died during the protests though that figure could not be confirmed furthermore the government shut down the internet for a week in an effort to prevent details and graphic images of the crackdown from reaching the outside world the action also complicated efforts to organize rallies and for protesters to communicate or share information domestically rand corporation analyst ariane tabatabai told rfe rl that the crackdown highlighted tehran s concern over perceived internal and external threats the force with which the protests were suppressed the violence and fast pace at which the crackdown happened are indicative of the level of pressure iran feels at home and abroad and the levels of threat perception tehran s economic and social difficulties are likely to continue in 2020 amid the continuing pressure campaign by the united states which is constantly tightening the screw and a frustrated population that observers have warned could take to the streets again will reserves keep economy afloat in 2020 henry rome an iran analyst at the eurasia group in washington said iran s economy will remain in a very difficult position in 2020 while noting that a full economic collapse is unlikely non oil exports and employment remain robust and the government is slowly regaining control over inflation and the currency rome said and the iranian regime has an ultimate backstop security forces willing and able to kill their fellow citizens that very much limits the risk to stability in the near term kenneth katzman a senior iran analyst at the congressional research service told the washington post in september that iran still has about 100 billion in reserves adding that under current conditions that would last the iranians at least another two years but brian hook the u s special representative for iran said in a december interview with the wall street journal that based on classified intelligence iran has access to only 10 percent of its foreign exchange reserves due to banking sanctions and that as a result it would struggle to stabilize its currency and keep inflation down will tehran decide to talk with washington despite the heightened tensions between iran and the administration of u s president donald trump the two sides exchanged prisoners for the first time in december when iran released american graduate student xiyue wang and the u s freed iranian scientist massud soleimani in a swap in zurich despite the rare act of cooperation analysts said the chances for negotiations between u s and iranian officials over the current crisis remain dim henry rome said u s iranian negotiations are possible but unlikely in 2020 while trump remains keen to talk to tehran he is unwilling to pay iran s price of admission upfront sanctions relief and no initial photo op tehran is loath to begin talks with a president who could shortly lose reelection and in the immediate aftermath of the violent protests which the regime has blamed in part on the united states rome told rfe rl tabatabai predicts more strain between the two countries well before any negotiations take place for now if nothing major happens i think we may see another period of heightened tension before we see negotiations due to iran s threat perception and the belief that iran must create leverage before it returns to talks tabatabai said will the nuclear deal survive in 2020 in recent months iran has gradually reduced its commitments under the historic 2015 nuclear deal the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa that it negotiated with six world powers to give tehran relief from international sanctions in exchange for curbs on its controversial nuclear program the united states exited the jcpoa unilaterally in 2018 before reimposing crippling sanctions on iran iran s moves to expand its nuclear activities aimed at pressuring the european signatories to the agreement to help tehran bypass u s sanctions and benefit economically from the deal have led to concern about the future of the accord analysts say iran is likely to take more serious steps away from its commitments under the jcpoa that could endanger the deal even further iran has played it close to the chest in recent months not giving us too many hints as to what these may entail but if the pattern is any indication we are likely looking at more troubling steps from a nonproliferation perspective said tabatabai henry rome said the 2015 agreement is likely to limp along in 2020 i think it s unlikely the deal fully falls apart because both iran and europe see a skeleton deal as useful for europe it provides a framework for future talks if a democrat wins in 2020 and iran can continue to claim compliance with at least some components parliamentary elections during deep crisis of legitimacy the parliamentary elections scheduled for february 21 will be another challenge for iran which needs a high turnout to boast it has public support at a time of intense internal and external pressure but a crisis of legitimacy the most serious since the 2009 crackdown on peaceful protesters challenging a disputed presidential election could lead to a lower turnout than usual that would damage the clerical establishment even further for now there hasn t been any major call for a boycott but on social media sites some iranians have asked whether it makes sense to vote for an establishment that does not shy away from killing its citizens when people lose their lives while protesting we cannot participate in the elections and buy legitimacy for a system that has killed bahareh hedayat a prominent student activist and women s rights activist who spent several years in prison said on twitter on december 6 abdollah ramezanzadeh a former spokesman for the government of reformist ex president mohammad khatami said in a tweet on december 6 that the country has reached such a stage that only free elections will return it to the right path he said trying to run as a candidate in the elections was meaningless due to the vetting process by the powerful hard line guardians council which has a stellar record in all previous elections of banning pro reform and independent candidates from running
the mood of the market turned quickly at the end of last year photo getty images the mood of the market turned quickly at the end of last year photo getty images the 2010s were a turbulent transformative and testing time for the global economy but there was not a recession that is extremely rare in fact it is the first decade in the post world war ii era without a downturn in the uk and us a year ago many economists thought the global economy would be crawling over the line into the 2020s and would suffer a recession soon after read more indicators are flashing red warning signs recession is looming a recession will come but how bad will it be jared bernstein just how likely is a recession experts warn the next recession will be worse than the great depression and predict it will hit us within two years the trade war had escalated at a frightening pace brexit was in deadlock global factories were heading into a deep industrial recession and central banks appeared to be oblivious to the threat of a downturn the market s most trusted recession signal the us treasury yield curve then flashed red predicting one within 24 months but the mood on markets has turned on a pinhead an ageing and in some parts of the world record long economic cycle appears to have been given a shot in the arm city forecasters have pencilled a slight acceleration in global growth from 2019 s post financial crisis low of 3pc to 3 1pc this year and 3 2pc in 2021 what changed the headwinds that threatened to tip the world into the next economic crisis have waned substantially the us and china have reached an agreement for a phase one trade deal potentially putting a pause on the protectionist wave sweeping the globe boris johnson s decisive victory in the election will not only get his brexit deal over the line but gives him more wriggle room in the next stage of negotiations and crucially central banks have moved from tightening financial conditions to cutting interest rates and ploughing more money into markets the federal reserve the us central bank cut borrowing costs three times this year and moved from reversing quantitative easing its bond buying programme to expanding its balance sheet again the european central bank has also extended its experimental policies to revive growth cutting rates deeper into negative territory and restarting its qe programme after an ill conceived attempt to end it a year ago while many economists fret central banks will now not have the firepower to fight a recession if one does strike the latest burst of stimulus has catapulted stock markets to new record highs global stocks have followed their worst year since the financial crisis in 2018 with their best gaining 25 per cent last year but with growth still languishing at post crisis lows are investors sleepwalking into the next recession most wall street analysts have predicted that the us china breakthrough and the fed s policy u turn will be enough to stave off recession the us became the focus of recession jitters earlier this year given its importance to global growth when america sneezes the rest of the world still catches a cold even as economic powers in the east rise however philip marey rabobank s senior us strategist warns the euphoria on markets over the trade deal has been overdone predicting the us will enter a recession in the second half of this year the deal struck by beijing and the trump administration picks the low hanging fruit of agricultural products and rolling back tariffs but fails to tackle the key sticking points between the two countries such as intellectual property marey also argues that business investment remains low and the slack left in the us economy the resources of an economy not being used is very small capping the room for growth a key risk is that business worries feed through into the jobs market and hit the confidence of consumers whose spending accounts for around 70 per cent of us gdp more rate cuts from the fed would not be able to support growth further he argues it is really ineffective in supporting business investment and that is where the real bottleneck is at the moment he says for businesses interest rates are low anyway so that is not their main concern the us election in november will start to come into focus for investors generating another source of uncertainty for businesses signs of a recession brewing in the us could severely dent donald trump s chances given the strong economy is seen as stopping his approval rating sliding any lower four more years of trump will increase the risk of another trade standoff but some of his democratic challengers are equally problematic for businesses and investors bernie sanders and elizabeth warren who are currently polling in second and third place ahead of the democratic primaries are two leftist populists with plans to radically redistribute wealth and take on wall street citi global chief economist catherine mann says uncertainty from trade and politics matters for the global economy the several risks that have been weighing on the global outlook have not dissipated and there is a non small probability that these intensify in 2020 while most investment banks believe the threat of an immediate downturn has been pushed back she warns that the risk of recession still does loom over the economy the relief from a prolonged and economically damaging period of uncertainty in the uk could also be brief even with the brexit deadlock broken economists expect growth in the uk to be tepid again this year slowing further from around 1 3 to 1 1 per cent with the prime minister insisting on a final trade deal with the eu being agreed before the end of the year more uncertainty could plague businesses and the uk economy no deal brexit worries could return in the second half of the year berenberg uk economist kallum pickering is more optimistic predicting that growth will hit 1 8 per cent this year after being boosted by the fiscal stimulus promised by the conservatives an orderly brexit can lift confidence and spending in the next two years after more than three years of heightened uncertainty and gradually softening momentum he says economists expect much of the business investment lost over the last three years to return but estimates of how much can be lured back vary from around a quarter to a half some of the investment will be lost forever however torsten bell chief executive of think tank the resolution foundation warns that britain s buoyant jobs market could turn in 2020 this could weaken the economic boost provided by record employment levels and shoppers enjoying their biggest pay rises since the last recession our best guess is that 2020 will be very different from the last few years bell says we may well see a welcome return to record pay levels but a less welcome retreat from record employment with worrying signs including falling vacancies and rising youth unemployment meanwhile the eurozone economy is expected to be weighed down again by germany in 2020 with the impotent ecb unable to provide much stimulus and northern european governments refusing to boost spending china which has been hit hardest in the industrial recession triggered by the trade war is also expected to slow further city forecasters are predicting its growth will sink below the symbolic 6 per cent mark despite beijing s huge fiscal and monetary stimulus efforts to pep up the economy while most economists believe a recession will now be avoided in 2020 the ability of policymakers and central bankers to revive growth is severely limited if one does strike the world economy is facing at the very least a prolonged period of stubbornly slow growth that will be difficult to escape telegraph
relying on historic performance low valuation of equities strong fundamentals of listed companies and falling yields in money market stakeholders in the stock market are hopeful of recovery in 2020 writes goddy egene after declining in 2015 and 2016 the nation s bourse recovered with a jump of over 40 per cent in 2017 the same scenario appears to be playing out currently having dipped in 2018 and 2019 market stakeholders are optimistic that the stock market will rebound in 2020 their optimism is boosted by developments in the fixed income and money markets space the stock market closed 2019 with another decline falling even by a magnitude that was beyond stakeholders expectations having posted a negative performance in the first half h1 of 2019 which was partly attributed to political risks there were hopes that the market would recover in the second half h2 of the year for instance analysts at fsdh research where highly optimistic last july and projected a recovery for the market in august according to fsdh research warren buffett a well known american business magnate and stock investor once said that as an investor it is wise to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful this means that investors who have long term funds can take advantage of the imbalance in the share prices of some companies that have strong investment case in the equity market although we may not know exactly when the equity market will take a turn it is clear that the market is close to the bottom therefore fsdh research expects the bulls to take over from the bears very soon they said the analysts said imagine that an investment of n100 000 in the equity market in 1985 recorded a return of 24 590 as at december 2018 this means that the n100 000 increased to n24 690 000 within 33 years without an additional capital this was the performance of the nigerian stock exchange nse all share index asi between 1985 and 2018 not a bad growth at all meanwhile there were some companies that recorded higher returns during this period than the nse asi but be aware that historical performance is no guarantee for future performance in the financial market the point that we are stressing is that investment in the equity market is for the long haul especially at a time when activities are depressed and share prices are low they added fsdh had explained that the equity market might recover from august saying that a number of companies have indicated that they will declare interim dividend for half year results only waiting for regulatory approvals in addition we expect the various monetary policies the central bank of nigeria cbn initiated to boost economic activity and lead to increased liquidity that can flow to the financial market this assumption is based on the availability of complementary fiscal measures that will de risk the economy the absence of which may limit the ability of the monetary policies to achieve the desired objectives fsdh research believes the current bearish trend in the equity market is an opportunity for strategic investors to take positions in the market in addition to the capital gain that investors enjoy in the equity market investors could also benefit from dividends that companies pay and the bonus issue additional shares that investors earn for which they do not pay the analysts said fsdh research added that it expected the low yields on fixed income securities in nigeria to provide an opportunity to source long term debt capital for infrastructure development in nigeria that will improve the nigerian business environment government and corporates can also leverage on the high appetite for debt securities to issue discount bonds meanwhile we see attractive investment opportunities in the following sectors of the equity market consumer goods industrial goods banking and oil and gas fsdh stated however the bulls never took over from the bears throughout the year leading to another decline in 2019 but most stakeholders believe 2020 will see the return of the bulls to the stock market according to a stockbroker and chief executive officer of sofunix investment and communications limited mr sola oni the market operated under a tough economic climate in 2019 as evident in incessant bearish trend until the policy of the central bank of nigeria on open market operations omo crashed yields on fixed income securities expectedly investors took flight for safety and reverted to purchase of equities with multiplier effects on the rise in many performance indicators the nse remains an investment destination he said according to him the outlook for the market in 2020 is attractive adding however that this is contingent on fixing of nigeria s weak economy where the gross domestic product gdp currently grows at 2 3 percent while the country s population grows at 2 6 per cent we expect faithful implementation of 2020 budget which was approved on record time government at all tiers should also take advantage of the market to mobilise fund for development projects however we expect the market to be driven by a mix of factors effects of negative real return on fixed income securities following the new policy on omo will continue to enhance demand for equities and attract more investors into the market we expect consolidation to be the hallmark of insurance sector as the market shall witness a flurry of mergers and acquisitions as well as business combination in a bid by insurance companies to recapitalize in line with the new policy of the national insurance commission naicom he said oni said many stocks are still trading below intrinsic values hence attractive valuation will attract more investors we expect intense competition among securities exchanges with the emergence of fmdq securities exchange as a full fledged exchange and lagos commodities and futures exchange lcfe which is set to commence operations already nasd plc has raised the bar of over the counter otc trading in nigeria but we expect the government to intensify efforts on creating conducive business environment through its policy on ease of doing business and building security he said he explained that the securities and exchange commission sec has just released the rules on trading in derivatives saying that was consistent with the plan by the nse to commence trading in derivatives in 2020 this is expected to enhance price discovery and usher investors on the exchange to modern risk management whereby they can hedge against

the structure of the market as the current owners the dealing member firms shall become shareholders and thus bring a new era of corporate governance on the nse with the crash of yields on fixed income securities pension funds may opt for high yielding stocks in the securities market and this is expected to boost market activities he added according to oni regardless of the nature of the economy in 2020 financial health technology and agriculture sectors have strong potential to provide good returns for investors financial sector is noted for liquidity the sector is fast attracting millennial customers through innovative services that thrive on technology health sector is recording advancement in medical equipment while pharmaceutical sector is evolving on daily basis we therefore expect health sector to provide investment opportunities in 2020 the technology sector itself is ruling the entire business world the relevance of artificial intelligence is already gaining momentum also innovative investments such as blockchains and cryptocurrency are highly dependent on technology trading on the securities market is technology driven the sector holds potential for good returns the federal government is committed towards reactivating agriculture and other forms of small and medium scale enterprises in nigeria through its policy of anchor borrower programme the success of the programme will be measured on its impact on the gdp and its ability to increase export in order to generate foreign exchange for the country and increase external reserve he stressed also speaking on the market outlook for 2020 the md ceo network capital limited mr oluropo dada expressed optimism and is bullish on the market according to him fundamentals of the quoted companies remain strong despite the harsh macroeconomic variables by way of dividend many companies especially banks will return over 10 per cent yield based on historical records again we expect pfa to make occasional intervention as a result of lower yields from the other market however it appears local investors will be the major determinant of the outlook as higher yields from united states markets may keep foreign investors away for some time by and large 2020 appears more promising that the previous years because the valuations of the stock market instruments are becoming more attractive to all the various classes of investors dada said speaking in the same vein the ceo investdata limited ambrose omordion said low interest rate regime increased credit to the real sector and early assent of the 2020 budget would impact positively on the market the market in 2020 looks promising as factors that will shape the economy and stock market are on the increase in spite of the continuous downgrade by rating agencies the early implementation of capital expenditure would have multiplier effect on the economy omordion said according to him regulatory initiatives and policies such as the cbn treasury bills tbs and omo restrictions will encourage local and institutional investors sentiment to the equity market he noted that the exchange new free float rule expected to commence on january 2 2020 would improve market liquidity and transparency thereby impacting positively on the market on sectors to watch out in 2020 omordion said that financial consumer goods building materials telecomms ict would be the most sought by investors the financial sector is more marketable consistent in dividend payout and if the economy finds its feet in 2020 the banks will benefit more omordion said he said low price attraction of consumer goods stocks due to huge losses suffered in 2019 would make the sector attractive according to him the low interest rate on consumption would boost industry earnings while mobile licence would boost telecomms sector s profitability in his opinion managing director apt securities and funds ltd garba kurfi said 2020 would be a better year for the nigerian stock market the crash of interest rate in the money market instrument from 15 per cent to about seven per cent or less makes money market returns negative compared with inflation of about 12 per cent he said

swastikas spray painted on dozens of gravestones in germany where a recent survey found that 1 in 4 hold anti semitic beliefs a gunman attacked a synagogue during yom kippur killing two people this rise in anti semitism must be met with a greater force one that we must all contribute to spreading houston is a diverse city with a thriving jewish community that deserves and welcomes support it takes all of us to stand up together and unite against this hate and perpetual violence saratovsky said we can t remain silent here we have to call for action and that s on all of us advertisement anti semitism is virulent and pervasive its tropes are used not only by racists but sometimes unwittingly reside along with calls for tolerance in many americans twitter feeds and thoughts while rep ilhan omar d minn rightly asked after the string of recent attacks that no one be targeted because of their faith race or ethnicity her previous tweets tied jews to money and loyalty to israel president donald trump who did the right thing monday by condemning the attack in a tweet that called on americans to eradicate the evil scourge of anti semitism has at other times relied on harmful tropes too he called jews brutal killers when it comes to business deals at an israeli american council conference this reminds us all that side by side with our compassion and our condemnations of anti semitism we should strive for understanding groups such as the jewish federation of greater houston engage in regular education efforts and interfaith community outreach but if we are all in this together the effort should go both ways this can begin as easily as visiting the newly reopened holocaust museum which teaches the dangers of prejudice and apathy or spending time at the jewish community center which offers the chance to experience activities and meet new people the only way to fight hate is through love meeting one another and understanding one another is a great way to start online ___ dec 31 the khaleej times on former renault nissan chief carlos ghosn being found in lebanon after escaping from japan as a fugitive when a former auto boss turned suspect does a houdini act and vanishes from japan and mysteriously reappears in lebanon questions will be raised so how did carlos ghosn the former renault nissan chief pull off such an audacious escape from right under the noses of security agencies in japan a country where he is being investigated for corruption why was security so lax ahead of his trial ghosn is a familiar face and it is surprising how he managed to give officials the slip his lawyer said he is shocked by the development if some reports are to believed ghosn sneaked into musical instrument box aboard a private plane to lebanon where he holds citizenship and remains a respected figure despite his fall from grace on the other side of the world the former automobile titan also has a french passport but he decided against heading to the country as it has an extradition treaty with japan where he is being tried for white collar crimes this getaway appears to be an inside job and ghosn s connections in higher echelons seemed to have helped him flee the country but japanese prosecutors are not commenting and the country s courts are closed for the new year break the flight happened at an opportune moment for ghosn when the system was caught napping during the holiday season the former corporate hero was jailed on two occasions last year and the high profile case in japan has been followed closely by world media ghosn rose to fame after he did the impossible by bringing nissan and renault together for a successful partnership mitsubishi became the third partner to make it a behemoth but the fall was swift for ghosn the revered corporate saviour who has since maintained his innocence which raises another question why did he flee justice if his hands were clean the system in japan was rigged he said he had escaped injustice and political persecution he claimed lebanon where he is now based faces a harsh winter of discontent the economy is on its knees and there is political chaos a fugitive in its midst makes matters worse talk about flying from the frying pan to the fire to locate and extricate ghosn will therefore be a gargantuan task but the accused has promised to become more active on social media in the coming weeks meanwhile the quest for justice continues the system clearly failed to stop carlos ghosn from fleeing because it was rigged online ___ dec 30 the dallas morning news on the church shooting near fort worth on sunday dec 29 the kind of news no one wants to see slid across the landscape there was a shooting at a church in white settlement outside of fort worth and there were casualties but as we delved into the details we will admit feeling first a sense of relief that the loss of life was not larger two innocent lives were lost along with the assailant and then a sense of gratitude our gratitude which was also felt by gov greg abbott comes from the knowledge that this mass shooter would have likely incurred a lot more mayhem except for the fact that a good man and a volunteer member of the church s security team immediately shot back in response to the era of mass shootings that we are in texas specifically enacted a law to allow law abiding citizens to carry concealed weapons in church and elsewhere unless specifically prohibited at that location that law saved lives this weekend in north texas regardless of whether people like this fact it remains true that there have been at least two church shootings in texas in recent years that ended because law abiding citizens had the means and willingness to fight back the second occurred two years ago in sutherland springs and unfortunately resulted in the loss of many more lives but as in this most recent shooting in that incident the assailant did not survive after good men responded with force the truth is that there isn t one solution that will bring an end to all mass attacks which is one reason we ve supported such things as creating a federal center to evaluate local state and federal laws to find the cracks violent criminals exploit to obtain firearms but it is also true that part of the set of solutions will have to involve enabling innocent people to protect themselves and each other up to and including fighting back if that s tough to consider there is another hard reality cast into sharp relief by this latest shooting as in many other incidents whether it s a knife wielding attacker on a jewish community in new york or a synagogue church mosque or other shooting the attack in north texas was an assault on a community on a group of people freely associating with each other and working toward common purpose these attacks are pernicious and act with particular purpose to destroy communities they seek to kill more than individual lives they seek to kill social bonds that bind us together they seek to divide and isolate to leave survivors feeling alone or unsafe in any common space so it is all the more important for us to stand together in defense against hateful divisive and evil purpose it is civil society itself that s under attack online ___ dec 30 the new york times on raising the minimum wage opponents of minimum wage laws have long argued that companies have only so much money and if required to pay higher wages they will employ fewer workers now there is evidence that such concerns never entirely sincere are greatly overstated over the past five years a wave of increases in state and local minimum wage standards has pushed the average effective minimum wage in the united states to the highest level on record the average worker must be paid at least 11 80 an hour more after inflation than the last peak in the 1960s according to an analysis by the economist ernie tedeschi and even as wages have marched upward job growth remains strong the unemployment rate at the end of 2019 will be lower than the previous year for the 10th straight year the interventions by some state and local governments however do not obviate the need for federal action to the contrary millions of workers are being left behind because 21 states still use the federal standard 7 25 an hour which has not risen since 2009 the longest period without an increase since the introduction of a federal standard in the 1930s across much of america the minimum wage is set to rise again in the next few days in maine and colorado it will reach 12 in washington 13 50 in new york city 15 workers in the rest of the country also deserve a raise the time has come to increase the federal minimum house democrats passed legislation in july that would gradually increase the federal standard to 15 an hour in 2025 likely raising the real value above the peak value in the late 1960s and most of the democrats running for president have endorsed the legislation last year only about 430 000 people or 0 5 percent of hourly workers were paid the federal minimum the share has fallen in recent years as state and local governments and some employers have stepped in but a much larger group of workers stand to benefit because they now earn less than the proposed minimum the congressional budget office estimated a 15 minimum hourly wage would raise the pay of at least 17 million workers among the beneficiaries people who work for tips federal law lets businesses pay 2 13 an hour to waiters bartenders and others who get tips so long as the total of tips and wages meets the federal minimum the legislation would end that rule the same minimum would apply to all hourly employees opponents of the change argue customers will curtail tipping and workers will end up with less money but eight states including minnesota montana and oregon already have a universal minimum including for tipped workers and restaurant workers in those states make more money crucially the legislation also would require automatic adjustments in the minimum wage to keep pace with wage growth in the broader economy the current minimum rises only when congress is in the mood as a result the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has eroded by nearly 40 percent over the last half century a full time worker making the minimum wage cannot afford a one bedroom apartment in almost any american city the simplistic view that minimum wage laws cause unemployment commanded such a broad consensus in the 1980s that this editorial board came out against the federal minimum in 1987 calling it an idea whose time has passed and citing as evidence a virtual consensus among economists the old critique is still put forward regularly by the restaurant industry and other major employers of low wage workers but evidence that any such effects are relatively small has been piling up for several decades a groundbreaking study published in 1993 by the economists david card and alan krueger examined a minimum wage rise in new jersey by comparing fast food restaurants there and in an adjacent part of pennsylvania it found no impact on employment this prompted other economists to test the standard theory this year the british government asked the economist arindrajit dube to review the results accumulated over the last quarter century mr dube reported the sum total of the research showed minimum wage increases raised compensation while producing a very muted effect on employment the patchwork nature of recent minimum wage increases the rate rising in some jurisdictions while staying the same in adjacent areas is offering new opportunities for research consider for instance the situation along the new york pennsylvania border new york state has been raising its minimum wage since 2016 on tuesday the legal minimum will reach 11 80 outside new york city pennsylvania meanwhile is among the 21 states where the 7 25 minimum remains in force in september researchers at the federal reserve bank of new york found that wages have climbed significantly in counties along the new york side of the state line again without a discernible difference in the pace of employment growth for most companies the bill is relatively small and it can be defrayed by giving less money to shareholders or by raising prices opponents often argue minimum wage increases will encourage automation but the point is easily overstated companies constantly invest in technology mcdonald s is installing self order kiosks across the united states not just at places with higher minimum wages and instead of replacing workers with robots companies may choose to invest in technology that enhances the productivity of their work force more than doubling the current federal standard would be a significant change and it is not without risk it is possible that a national 15 standard would produce the kinds of damage critics have long predicted the congressional budget office puts the potential increase in unemployment somewhere between zero and 3 7 million people essentially acknowledging the effects are unpredictable workers may be most vulnerable in areas where prevailing wages are relatively low in california for example the minimum wage for large employers more than 25 workers will rise to 13 an hour on wednesday that is unlikely to cause problems in san francisco but the new minimum is quite close to the median hourly wage of 15 23 in the visalia metropolitan area in the central valley the federal minimum would apply to metropolitan areas like daphne ala and sumter s c where the median worker earned less than 15 an hour in 2018 one simple corrective proposed by senator michael bennet of colorado would be to include exemptions from the 15 standard for low wage metropolitan areas and rural areas but the successful increases in minimum wage standards across a diverse range of states and cities suggest the broader risk is worth taking the american economy is generating plenty of jobs the problem is in the paychecks the solution is a 15 federal minimum wage online ___ dec 30 the wall street journal on the stock market in 2019 regarding the movement of equity prices we associate with the words of alan ace greenberg the head of bear stearns during the 1987 market crash stocks fluctuate next question the good news in 2019 is that mostly they fluctuated up which offers a lesson or two stock prices fell monday dec 30 no doubt in part as investors took profits before the end of the year but what profits they probably are with one day of trading left in 2019 the s p 500 was up 29 for the year the nasdaq composite had risen 35 and even the dowdy dow jones industrial average climbed 22 apple and microsoft which drove much of the increase in the nasdaq each now have market capitalizations of more than 1 2 trillion anyone who sold a year ago missed a major boost in net worth yet at the time the investor mood was negative markets had declined in the fourth quarter of 2018 as the federal reserve tightened money and donald trump s trade war accelerated fears of recession were widespread and even mr trump had stopped touting stock prices on twitter one lesson is that no one knows how stocks will perform in any given year because so much can change in 2019 the fed quickly corrected its december 2018 mistake of raising interest rates inflation stayed under control mr trump decided that he wanted a trade truce with china notwithstanding some harrowing fits and starts along the way the momentum built by tax reform and deregulation helped the economy and especially the job market stay remarkably buoyant despite a trade induced recession in manufacturing see the editorial nearby if you predicted all this raise your hand we didn t think so the same uncertainty applies to stocks in 2020 an election year that adds political volatility to the usual economic and policy variables will mr trump revert to trade populism if his re election looks to be in jeopardy will markets fall at least for a while if bernie sanders or elizabeth warren appear likely to win the democratic presidential nod the truth is no one knows though the fact that some people think they do is what helps make a market you know for every buyer there s a seller some poor folks probably even heeded the infamous oct 21 2016 article in politico that began wall street is set up for a major crash if donald trump shocks the world on election day and wins the white house the s p 500 was then trading at about 2200 it closed monday at 3221 the lesson here is that as warren buffett likes to say don t bet against the united states to succeed america makes mistakes voters sometimes hand power to misguided politicians and the public sometimes succumbs to financial manias that turn into panics and crashes but left to work trade and invest without too much political interference americans unleash their energies in productive fashion stocks fluctuate but over time they go up often in years you least expect it online ___ dec 27 the seattle times on a federal law helping community newspapers the survival of independent regional newspapers shows hope for a revival of american local journalism thanks to a new federal law these bastions of the free press including the seattle times can build toward long term stability despite financial burdens left from an earlier era part of the budget deal signed dec 20 the save the community newspaper act will allow privately held community newspapers to stretch out payments owed to pension plans that have been frozen through years of industry trouble without the urgently needed relief these newspaper companies would face immense obligations coming due in 2021 under federal pension contribution laws this long sought relief reduces the annual bill to a manageable level while preserving pensioners rights to every penny they are due for the times along with sister papers in yakima and walla walla the restructuring reduces the annual bill by more than 10 million by extending payments over time that longer runway means the difference between an imminent

troubles business decisions sank the journalism and communities lost out according to the columbia journalism review s layoff tracker website some 3 160 newsroom jobs disappeared in 2019 mostly at

josé ramón díez guijarro bankia estudios the end of the year has served to dismiss some of the doubts that have distorted the decisions of the economic agents during the last months ballasting the growth rates of the activity visibility has improved in the short term yet uncertainty is here to stay more time and resources will be required to try to understand its influence on consumption and investment decisions in a world in which information flows through very different channels but for now we know two things that clarify the scenario for the first part of 2020 i the two large central banks consider that the activity has entered a stabilization stage after the alarms of last summer and ii the intensity of the commercial conflict decreases both by the certification of the usmca former nafta by the united states house of representatives and by the signing of an armistice in the commercial conflict between the united states and china phase 1 of the agreement that is to say until the us presidential elections the tariff distension could be maintained which will include some reductions of the tariffs applied in the last 18 months limiting the damages in the value chains and encouraging some investment decision that had been postponed before the noise transmitted by tariff uncertainty the two large central banks do not seem to lower interest rates again in the absence of negative economic surprises in the case of the fed because the preventive movement of interest rate cuts is closed once the us economy continues to show solidity in the case of the ecb because in addition to some stabilization in the activity data recognized by lagarde in her first press conference as head of the bank evidence of the negative side effects that would deepen the negative interest rate zone will accumulate in this sense the central bank of sweden finalized the negative interest rate policy nirp by placing the repo rate at 0 not because of an improvement in the economic situation but because of the threats to financial stability that negative rates pose especially when they last for a long time in addition we must consider the difficulties of explaining the benefits of such an anomalous situation penalizing savings for so long awaiting the last sessions of the year and once the last obstacles have been saved the behavior of the financial markets in 2019 has been very positive with practically all asset categories presenting returns above the historical average in some cases doubling it it is evident that part of the good behavior responds to the compensation of 4q2018 losses and therefore the starting point for next year is more challenging for the market since valuations are much more adjusted even so in an environment of wide geopolitical noise and mediocre growth data the results have ended up being similar to those of 2017 when the growth rates of the world economy were much higher and in addition they were distributed in a much more homogeneous among large economic regions for the moment we are talking about expectations of an improvement in the first quarters of next year as we do not forget that in the last quarter of this year the world economy would have grown at the lowest rates of the last four years 2 2 2 3 reflecting the deterioration of world trade the atony of industrial sectors and the effect of uncertainty on consumption and investment decisions that is activity still does not reflect the generalized drop in interest rates since the summer the change in tone in expectations and the wealth effect encouraged by market increases but the risk on movement and therefore the improvement of investors perspectives is perceived in which high risk segments such as the american corporate bonds with ccc rating have had a revaluation in december 4 5 in the last weeks of the year the confidence that the global expansion is prolonged has increased while the probabilities assigned to a recession have been decreasing world growth in 2020 may be similar to this year but with a more balanced distribution less contribution from the united states and improvements in emerging economies especially latin america and emerging europe stabilization is the new buzzword to refer to the behavior of the main short term economies but being aware that the balance of risks remains biased downwards in this sense robert lightizer the highest commercial representative of the united states warned that trump s next focus on the trade conflict is going to be europe

much more familiar place for australians a frenzy of bidding driving house prices up at a record rate house prices are booming again picture supplied we all learned something in 2019 some aussies were shocked to discover house prices can actually fall we also learned house prices will bounce back if the rba cuts interest rates this is good news for homeowners in the short run because it looks likely the rba will cut rates again soon the official cash rate could hit a new record low as early as february 2020 and the bank won t mind if house prices rise it has said it was surprised by the effects of the recent house price fall and implied it won t be making that mistake again soon it likes the way people spend more when their house prices are rising because that spending drives the economy but in the longer run the link from housing prices to interest rates raises big questions with interest rates at record lows surely they must eventually rise again after all the last two decades of rising house prices happened as rates fell from 5 per cent in 2000 to 4 per cent in 2010 then to 0 75 per cent in 2020 if falling rates cause a long positive house price cycle what happens

via zealllc the us stock markets soared in 2019 blasting to dozens of new all time record highs euphoric traders attributed these massive gains to strong corporate fundamentals and us china trade war progress but the real driver of stocks astounding ascent was the federal reserve s epic extreme easing a panicking fed pulled out all the stops to goose and levitate stocks leaving fake artificially inflated markets in its wake this year s huge stock market rally delighted nearly everyone generating widespread euphoria that made americans feel wealthier leading them to spend more freely that pushed corporate sales and profits higher than they otherwise would ve been speculators and investors loved the easy largely one sided gains and stocks biggest fan trump reveled in what lofty record stock markets implied about his policies with the flagship us s p 500 stock index spx rocketing up an amazing 28 6 year to date at best by late december everything looked awesome record high stock markets must mean the us economy is booming the best of times but under that happy headline facade the real stock market picture is deeply troubling the spx s monster gains have been directly driven by an american central bank terrified of a recession some background context is necessary to understand 2019 s stunning stock market action back in late 2008 the us stock markets were slammed by the first true panic in 101 years the spx plummeted 30 0 in a single month which proved part of a larger 56 8 bear that threatened a severe recession if not an outright depression due to stock markets powerful wealth effect the fed rushed to mitigate those risks its primary monetary policy tool the overnight federal funds rate it controls was already down at 2 00 heading into october 2008 s brutal stock panic the fed still slashed the ffr by 50 basis points twice within that month cutting it to 1 00 with spending and economic activity collapsing in response to that stock market plummeting soon after in mid december the fed enacted its first ever zero interest rate policy once a central bank runs out of rate cuts its options for further easing are limited it can then either force rates negative or start printing money since nirp has even worse collateral damage than zirp the fed chose the latter option because conjuring new fiat money out of thin air to monetize debt has a disastrous historical track record the fed obscured its huge inflating in the benign euphemism quantitative easing the fed was spinning up qe during that stock panic even before it went zirp when the fed wishes new money into existence to use to buy bonds they show up on its balance sheet in late august 2008 just before that stock panic the fed s total assets ran 898 6b over the next 17 weeks into slashing the ffr to zero they skyrocketed a mind boggling 150 9 higher to 2255 0b that money printing was crazy while the spx finally bottomed in march 2009 kicking off what would grow into the longest bull market in us history the fed kept the pedal to the metal it kept zirp in place continuously for 7 0 years before finally mustering the courage to make a tentative rate hike in mid december 2015 its first in 9 5 years it was ridiculous for the fed to wait so long to start normalizing rates as the spx soared 135 3 during zirp that mighty stock market bull closely mirrored the fed s epic balance sheet expansion as it continued to evoke new money to buy more bonds through several qe campaigns qe1 qe2 and qe3 were each followed by their own expansions the fed s assets finally peaked at 4516 1b in mid january 2015 up a ludicrous 402 6 since just before late 2008 s stock panic all together total qe clocked in at 3617 5b keeping rates artificially low and bonds monetized artificially high was risky and foolish at some point another recession was inevitable and the fed had virtually no ammunition left to fight it it had to start hiking rates to make room for future cuts and whittling down its horrendously bloated balance sheet to reload for future qe campaigns the fed s timing on that long overdue normalization sure looked political after that initial december 2015 hike the fed sat on its hands heading into the november 2016 elections rate hikes weigh on stock markets and the better stock markets perform in the final few months before a presidential election the greater the odds the incumbent party will win the hyper easy fed chair then was janet yellen a lifelong democrat and republican lawmakers were heavily attacking her zirp and qe after trump s surprise election victory the fed radically accelerated its rate hikes it boosted its ffr target range a second time in mid december 2016 and then late each quarter between early 2017 to late 2018 it raised rates again ultimately taking the total hikes to 9 obama only saw 1 rate hike while trump had to deal with 8 the only quarter the fed didn t hike was q3 17 when it introduced quantitative tightening qt was necessary to start unwinding that gargantuan 3617 5b of qe that accrued over 6 4 years starting during that stock panic between the fed s peak assets in january 2015 to it finally birthing qt in late september 2017 the fed s balance sheet never contracted by more than 1 5 total despite the spx s enormous zirp and qe goosed bull to date gains of 270 8 by then doing qt still scared the fed so it decided to gradually phase in qt mechanically starting with a trivial 10b per month pace in q4 17 as bonds within that limit matured the fed wouldn t buy new ones effectively destroying that bit of qe conjured money each quarter qt would ratchet up 10b per month until it hit its terminal pace of 50b per month starting in q4 18 the spx surged to record highs before that despite the ramping qt and 8 rate hikes the fed s monster spx bull extended to 333 2 gains heading into q4 18 leading to rampant euphoria and complacency i took the contrarian view then in one of my most read essays ever titled fed qt is bull s death knell i argued an anomalous qe fueled stock bull couldn t survive qt intact qt going full bore at 50b per month for 30 months even to unwind merely half of all that qe would slaughter stocks the complacent fed didn t look worried as the spx had levitated on republicans corporate tax cuts and us china trade deal hopes for most of the year qt was ramping up but all hell was about to break loose as qt hit terminal velocity this chart superimposes the spx over the fed s total assets in recent years all the ffr hikes rate cuts qt and qe changes are noted this fully explains 2019 s huge spx rally trump s new fed chair jerome powell had taken the helm in february 2018 by october 3rd he was getting cocky as the spx had mostly gone straight up despite that qt ramp and rate hikes under his watch in a speech he flipped on the hawkish afterburners saying rates were a long way from neutral at this point and we may go past neutral that s when the spx started selling off rolling over hard out of euphoria with qt killing 50b per month of qe the spx dropped 12 7 between just before the fed s 8th rate hike in late september to just before its 9th one in mid december that was in correction territory over 10 but didn t look particularly threatening so the fed made the 9th rate hike of its tightening cycle as traders expected on december 19th 2018 the spx wilted on that plunging another 7 7 over 4 trading days that forecast hike wasn t the problem it was top fed officials collective outlook on future rate hikes that is quantified quarterly at every other federal open market committee meeting in a part of its summary of economic projections known as the dot plot that day the fed policymakers were forecasting 3 more rate hikes only striking a single one traders had expected a more dovish outlook after that sizable spx selloff the reaction was swift and violent the spx plunged 1 8 from intraday highs within 15 minutes of that release the aftermath took the spx s total correction to a serious 19 8 in just 3 1 months right on the verge of a new bear market at 20 the fed was rightfully blamed for that although traders overlooked the fact the stock bull never would ve run anywhere near as long or large without all those years of zirp and qe powell gives press conferences after fomc decisions and he said something after that mid december one that further spooked traders he declared the fed was sticking with its original plan to keep qt on automatic pilot at 50b per month the fed would only change the ffr to make monetary policy not alter the balance sheet runoff with the spx sharply lower the formerly ignored qt was becoming big news that was 2019 s setup a wounded stock bull teetering on the edge of a new bear after a hawkish fed shot it with trump attacking the fed every chance he got for not cutting rates it couldn t risk the political fallout for being blamed for killing a bull and spawning a bear the resulting negative wealth effect would trigger a severe recession if not depression so 2019 s whole story is the fed doing a massive turn one eight as usual after a sharp plunge the spx was due to bounce proportionally into january 2019 after that christmas eve near bear low a few trading days after that fomc decision powell was eager to tell stock traders exactly what they wanted to hear right out of the gates on january 4th he started goosing the spx with a speech in atlanta he totally backtracked on his qt autopilot statement saying the polar opposite the spx rocketed 3 4 higher that day alone after powell said there is no preset path for policy and the fed is prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly he explicitly said qt could be changed if needed and assured the fed was listening carefully to markets that began a long year of high fed officials doing and saying everything they could to lift stock markets they radically shifted from hawkish to uber dovish by mid january the spx had surged 13 6 out of its recent near bear lows but was stalling out after that violent v bounce so the fed rushed to the rescue at its january 30th fomc meeting the first since that mid december one tanked markets the fomc statement reference of some further gradual increases in rates was deleted outright and the fed extraordinarily issued an entirely separate statement on qt alone it assured the fomc was prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments so the spx surged 1 6 that day alone and 3 7 over 5 trading days that extended its total post severe correction rebound to 16 4 whenever the spx s momentum started to fade it seemed top fed officials would jump in bringing tidings of dovishness for example on february 27th powell testified before the us congress that the fomc was planning on ending qt entirely sometime later this year so much for normalizing the fed s balance sheet as the fed officials caved after a single big spx correction still the blistering spx surge which was acting like a bear market rally despite stock markets just missing bear dom was running out of steam again in early march so the fed completely surrendered to traders at its march 20th fomc meeting top fed officials dot pot rate outlook the first since mid december s crushed stock markets slashed 2019 s hikes from 2 to 0 and the fomc declared it would cease qt years early by the end of september that qt tapering plan would leave total qt at just 825 0b or only 22 8 of that enormous 3617 5b of qe piled on over 6 4 years the original expectation when qt launched in q4 17 was for a half unwind but the cowardly fed could not even do a quarter after the spx plunged that radical shift from qt on autopilot for years to qt is dead goosed the stock markets again ultimately pushing the spx to new record highs starting in late april that entire deep near bear correction had been erased thanks to exceedingly dovish fed jawboning but the spx s colossal 25 3 rocketing over just 4 2 months into late april was absurd driven solely by fed talkand not fundamentals experienced traders realized that so the spx started rolling over hard in may as june dawned it had fallen 6 8 in just over a month even that pullback was unacceptable to a fed hellbent on levitating stocks so jerome powell short circuited that selloff with a june 4th chicago speech he declared recent developments involving trade negotiations between the us and china could affect the us economy thus the fed was closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the u s economic outlook and as always we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion stock traders interpreted that as powell intended if the us china trade war hit stocks the fed would start cutting rates again powell also laid the groundwork that day for zirp and qe to become permanent normal monetary policy tools not just the temporary crisis measures they were long promised as that day alone the spx surged 2 1 higher igniting a major 5 2 5 trading day rally powell s insane dovishness had stopped an spx pullback threatening to snowball into a correction dead in its tracks the fed is the only reason stocks soared the fomc s stunning reversal from hiking to cutting continued at its june 19th meeting that day s dot plot kept 2019 neutral but changed 2020 s lone future hike to a cut that effectively staked its 9 hike old tightening cycle that had been put on hold in mid december after the spx plunged incidentally that big shift from fed hiking to cutting is what ignited gold propelling it to its first bull market breakout in several years the spx rallied another 1 2 over a couple trading days to hit another record high on that if the fed hadn t totally capitulated on qt and rate hikes there s no way the stock markets would ve fully reversed their q4 18 near bear losses that stunning rebound rally was mostly fake manufactured by extreme fed dovishness you d think killing qt way early and more than restoring the spx would be mission accomplished but it wasn t again by mid december 2018 the fomc had hiked the ffr 9 times taking it to a target range between 2 25 to 2 50 that was still super low historically far from being normalized from late june 2006 to mid september 2007 for example the ffr was set at 5 25 continuously having just 9 cuts left before going zirp again wasn t much precious rate cutting ammunition to fight the next recession the spx achieved another 8 new record closing highs in july adding to the 5 before that with stock markets euphoric and everyone happy logically the fed would preserve its mere 9 available cuts and with trump relentlessly attacking the fed as an institution and powell personally via twitter cutting rates would make it look like the fomc caved to trump the idea of cutting rates at record spx levels was crazy yet inexplicably at the fomc s next meeting on july 31st it cut the ffr by 25 basis points that officially staked the previous hiking cycle and spoiled stock traders expecting it to be the start of a cutting cycle the fed had cowardly kowtowed to them and trump with a not economically warranted cut powell tried to say that was one off calling it a midcycle adjustment and not the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle how dare he even after 7 months straight of epic fed dovishness stock traders threw a temper tantrum and hammered the spx 2 0 lower intraday on that it fell 1 1 on close its worst down day in 8 weeks on powell s meek stand that selling cascaded after trump hit china with another round of tariffs driving the spx into a 6 1 pullback while fed officials were quiet fomc meeting minutes helped turn that around 3 weeks after each fomc meeting the fed publishes their minutes that july 31st one with the fomc s first rate cut in 10 6 years also had a discussion hinting qe might soon return the last expanded qe3 had been finally wound down way back in october 2014 yet even with the spx near record highs the top fed officials were pondering launching qe4 mentioning asset purchases a half dozen times in those minutes despite the spx hovering over 3000 2 6 above september 2018 s pre full speed qt peak the fomc cut a second time at its mid september meeting it had squandered 2 of its 9 rate cuts it should save for the next recession the fed was also trying to counter rates blowing out in the overnight repurchase agreements market which impaired its ability to set the federal funds rate so it launched emergency repo ops these were huge starting at 75b per day at his press conference powell declared the fed would be assessing the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organic growth of our balance sheet and i m sure we ll be revisiting that question during this intervening period and certainly at our next meeting that was fedspeak for the fed was considering birthing qe4 as soon as late october s fomc meeting fed officials believed the repo market chaos resulted from its balance sheet sinking too low qt was fully tapered off at the end of august pushing the fed s total assets down to a 5 9 year low of 3759 9b yet that was still 4 2x higher than pre stock panic levels that pegged total qt as just 756 1b or merely 20 9 of the total qe the fed was starting to panic again after unwinding just 1 5th of its qe bond buying why on earth was qe4 being discussed with record stock markets repo market rates were forcing the ffr above its target range so the fed was losing control but resuming qe bond monetizations was just as foolish as rate cuts squandering more recession fighting ammo the spx actually slumped 4 0 in the couple weeks after that mid september fomc meeting as traders wondered why the fed was so scared while the fed s huge daily emergency repo ops continued and grew they were supposedly temporary yet the fed s balance sheet started surging higher again the fed reports that data each wednesday and by october 9th 6 weeks after that qt ending secular low the fed s total assets had soared 5 1 or 190 0b higher qe4 looked to be already underway in stealth mode to keep from embarrassing the fed as the fed s newly exploding balance sheet became more widely known powell was forced to explain it between fomc meetings he gave a speech in early october pre announcing qe4 but wouldn t call it qe i want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis oddly on october 11th several weeks before its next formal meeting the fomc released a statement birthing qe4 it was massive definitely large scale despite powell s protests the fed was going to purchase treasury bills at an initial pace of approximately 60 billion per month starting with the period from mid october to mid november and purchase treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year if that runs to mid q2 20 and that 60b per month pace is maintained qe4 was initially tracking at 420b of treasury monetizations that 60b tempo was 50 larger than qe3 at launch although that was soon expanded to 85b monthly but only 45b per month of qe3 was in treasuries compared to all 60b for qe4 qe3 s overall final size weighed in at 1590b so if not expanded qe4 will clock in at over a quarter of that the spx started surging again as the fed s balance sheet exploded vertically qe inflation is rocket fuel for stock markets wildly bullish the peak qe3 year and peak qe in general year was 2013 the fed conjured 1125 3b out of thin air to buy bonds that year catapulting its balance sheet 38 7 higher the spx s reaction was incredible rocketing 29 6 higher closely mirroring the fed s balance sheet expansion these new qe4 treasury monetizations would happen twice a week at 7 5b each not surprisingly with the fed injecting 60b per month of brand new fiat money into the markets again the spx took off like a bat out of hell in the 7 weeks after qe4 was announced the spx blasted 7 3 higher to achieve 13 new all time record highs overall between late august to mid december the fed s assets soared 10 0 or 377 1b that balance sheet growth rate was astounding the fastest by far since january 2014 when qe3 was still running full steam the fed s claims that this was all normal reserve management were total crap it reminds me of that famous jean claude juncker quote when heading the european union he once said when it becomes serious you have to lie the fed has inarguably been panicking in recent months the fomc s late october meeting in the midst of that qe4 balance sheet explosion drove that point home with a firehose of qe capital injections deluging into the markets the spx right at all time record highs and trump attacking the fed and powell mercilessly the fed still inexplicably cut the ffr for the third time in just 3 0 months why did it waste fully 1 3rd of its recession fighting ammo if everything was awesome the last fomc meeting of the year came in mid december while the fed didn t cut again top fed officials continued capitulating on their rate outlook their median ffr forecasts for 2020 2021 and 2022 all fell by a quarter point because the heavy handed fed so moves markets i ve carefully studied its actions and their market results for decades believe me 2019 was an extraordinarily dovish year for it the us stock markets monster rally this past year had nothing to do with fundamentals us corporate earnings actually slumped in 2019 with q1 q2 and q3 dropping 0 3 0 4 and 2 3 year over year by late november q4 earnings estimates were running down 1 5 the spx would ve drifted lower in 2019 had it been following underlying fundamentals valuations verify this climbing through the entire year at the end of 2018 right near those full bore qt driven near bear correction lows in the spx its 500 elite companies averaged trailing twelve month price to earnings ratios of 26 1x by the end of november the latest month end data before this essay was published that key metric had expanded to 28 0x which is back in formal bubble territory that big 7 3 multiple expansion proves earnings didn t justify 2019 s rally us china trade war progress wasn t the driver either as there was virtually none until mid december at best throughout 2019 trump raised tariffs on china and china refused to make any of the big changes the us was demanding the phase one deal announced in recent weeks is a joke china allegedly agreeing to restore its us farm goods purchases in return for trump cutting tariffs and it hasn t even been signed the sole reason the spx rocketed 28 6 higher at best this year hitting 33 new all time record closing highs was an unbelievably dovish panicking fed if you carefully break down the spx gains the lion s share of them happened soon after the fed s major policy changes outlined in this essay if the fed had stayed its prudent and wise normalization course it was on in late 2018 2019 would ve looked radically different and 2020 isn t going to enjoy those same epic fed tailwinds the fomc can t prematurely kill qt again and can t shift from hiking to cutting again it only has 6 quarter point rate cuts left between here and zirp not much ammo left to dissipate it can keep monetizing treasuries with qe4 even upping those huge inflationary injections but the longer and bigger qe4 runs the more its implied necessity will scare traders if these bubble valued stock markets required epic fed easing to soar in 2019 what happens to them in 2020 as that vanishes at best spx gains will be far more subdued at worst the stock markets will sell off sharply and roll over into their fed delayed bear but make no mistake today s lofty stock market levels are totally fake they are wildly distorted directly conjured by the

market rally was fake conjured by an absurdly dovish federal reserve panicking after late 2018 s deep near bear correction it spawned the fed killed qt years early shifted its rate outlook from hiking to cutting slashed rates 3 times in 3 months and launched qe4 with large scale treasury monetizations that made 2019 one of the biggest fed easing years imaginable the massive stock market gains mostly came soon after these key fed decisions in a year where us corporate earnings shrank and the us china trade war really intensified it was epic extreme fed easing that levitated the stock markets 2020 will look way different since the fed is running out of room to keep cutting ultimately the fed spawned bubble valuations will overpower the fed s egregious market distortions we are

as we head in to 2020 many of us are focusing on one thing how to boost our net worth faced with challenging economic times the much warned about threat of recession basement level interest rates and stagnant wages many aussies are looking for ways to find a few extra dollars luckily there s a few refreshingly simple ways you can add millions and potentially even billions of dollars to your bank account dressing like departed apple deity steve jobs convincing people you re a technology company even when you re clearly not and good old fashioned breaking the law are just some of the easy ways you can turn your plucky young start up into a money printing machine without all the pesky added pressure of actually turning a profit but don t just take our advice smart people learn from their mistakes wise ones learn from those of others so here s a few places to get you started on the path to turning your simple idea into a slightly more complicated idea that venture capitalists will love so you want to be a tech billionaire the first thing you ll want to do if you re an aspiring tech billionaire is drop out of whatever university you re currently studying at preferably harvard bill gates microsoft and mark zuckerberg facebook both famously turned their back on the hallowed campus although zuck was almost kicked out before he could drop out his very normal and classy facemash website allowed horny harvard boys to rate the attractiveness of the women in their classes and he was threatened with expulsion presumably for violating copyright in using images of the women since there s clearly nothing wrong with the website he made at face value or with any more forensic a reading microsoft s bill gates took leave from harvard to found his company before eventually dropping out altogether aap image lukas coch facebook founder mark zuckerberg seen here being grilled by the us congress left harvard to grow his company after previously being threatened with expulsion ap photo alex brandon zuckerberg moved on from his little perv website to create facebook which was already going off when he decided to turn his back on harvard meanwhile having already taken an interest in computers in high school his alma mater lakeside prep one of the top 15 private schools in the united states was one of the first to get students access to computers gates took official leave to focus on starting his company before actually dropping out of harvard meaning he could return to one of the world s most prestigious colleges if he failed zuckerberg however would be forced to rely on his parents a psychiatrist and a dentist if he fell on hard times though thankfully that never happened of course if you don t go to one of the most renowned universities in the world and have parents from wealthy professional backgrounds you may want to factor this into your swot analysis but really you should have thought of that before you decided to be born into those circumstances and they should have no bearing on your access to the networks and resources you ll need to attract funding for your tech company but wait i don t run a tech company a wework office in new york hard

any code for apple at least according to his co founder steve wozniak he wasn t an engineer and he didn t do any original design but he was technical enough to alter and change and add to other designs mr wozniak said answering a 2013 email from the public merely having an opinion and being able to direct another person to realise your vision can be enough but what if your company objectively has nothing to do with technology simple just pretend that it does entrepreneurs in the real estate fitness and even hospitality industries are beginning to realise the secret power of

does your tech start up s home office which preferably will be in your garage rather than your actual home have an nbn connection congratulations your company is now backed by technology and well on the way to billions in funding this also provides another opportunity for you to increase your own personal net worth by turning your company into your customer much like wework founder adam neumann did neumann bought several commercial properties he then leased back to wework to turn into office spaces he has since been removed from the company so there are risks to this strategy but he was given more than a billion dollars before walking out the door so there are also rewards fake it until you make it this might seem like a lot to take on initially so it can be useful to look at a case

with the sec the alleged she lied to shareholders about the blood testing technology being used by the us department of defence theranos was also accused of overstating its revenue claiming it made

comment 2019 felt like a rollercoaster ride 2020 is almost certain to be even wilder australia has never started a year with interest rates so low and with so much uncertainty around doubt is enveloping house prices wages and global markets it s hard to see how the rba could possibly get relaxed enough about the future to raise interest rates so what will happen in the new year here are the four big issues you should be thinking about house prices 2019 was a surprising year for house prices the housing market started the year amid unusual gloom then did a big u turn it ended up in a much more familiar place for australians a frenzy of bidding driving house prices up at a record rate house prices are booming again picture supplied we all learned something in 2019 some aussies were shocked to discover house prices can actually fall we also learned house prices will bounce back if the rba cuts interest rates this is good news for homeowners in the short run because it looks likely the rba will cut rates again soon the official cash rate could hit a new record low as early as february 2020 and the bank won t mind if house prices rise it has said it was surprised by the effects of the recent house price fall and implied it won t be making that mistake again soon it likes the way people spend more when their house prices are rising because that spending drives the economy but in the longer run the link from housing prices to interest rates raises big questions with interest rates at record lows surely they must eventually rise again after all the last two decades of rising house prices happened as rates fell from 5 per cent in 2000 to 4 per cent in 2010 then to 0 75 per cent in 2020 if falling rates cause a long positive house price cycle what happens to house prices if the rba one day enters a multi year cycle of rate hikes a recession in 2019 many global recession warning signs started flashing red yield curves briefly inverted in the us which has been a mostly reliable precursor to recession in the last 40 years as the next graph shows are we headed for a recession it certainly seems like it picture supplied when the blue line dips below zero a recession usually follows but was the recent dip big enough google trends data also shows something interesting a big surge in people searching for information about recessions this indicator may be less technical than the yield curve and it has less history to draw on but it certainly peaked before the gfc so its accuracy should not be sneezed at more and more people are searching for the term recession picture supplied at home the biggest indicator of a possible recession may be the reserve bank talking about quantitative easing their forecasts remain mostly positive but quantitative easing is a tool for desperate times and if it s on the table for use in 2020 we have to ask why interest rates are already at record lows and seemingly having little effect if a recession does come in 2020 it s frightening to contemplate how little the rba might be able to do to reverse it jobs and earnings 2019 was not a terrible year for jobs but as the next graph shows it was not impressive underemployment and unemployment both rose taking us nearly back to where we were at the start of 2018 the unemployment and underemployment rates are on the rise again picture supplied rising underemployment is usually a bad sign for wages the backbone of the economy is our paycheques australians mostly spend what they earn and our earnings have not been growing well wages growth is down to around 2 per cent barely above inflation it is fair to ask what will happen in 2020 one useful sign for the future is the anz job ads series it counts up job ads to try to predict the future of the labour market but it has bad news about next year job ads have been falling as the next graph shows the forecast for jobs is not looking bright for 2020 picture supplied this suggests fewer people will be starting new jobs soon this is bad news because to get a raise we need a tighter labour market i e lots of people getting hired and not so many getting fired instead the reverse seems to be happening accordingly the government has downgraded its wages forecasts for 2020 in its mid year economic and fiscal outlook global markets more and more australia s economy depends on global markets we can be lifted up by policies made in beijing but we can also be brought down by mistakes made on wall street and silicon valley and there have been plenty of the latter in history 2019 was the year of the wework saga a hot american real estate start up funded with way too much venture capital money it was going to float on the stock market for billions of dollars instead it suddenly stumbled and fell the float was cancelled the ceo was sacked a whole lot of dodgy dealing was exposed the company is now slashing staff and trying to avoid bankruptcy wework points to a sickness in the american start up bubble in 2019 wework s problems looked isolated but are they in 2007 the pension funds that were having problems with subprime loans looked isolated too it was only by 2008 we realised they were a symptom of a big problem that led the whole word into the global financial crisis a lot of money has chased the start up bubble and if start up firms turn out to have been a bad investment a lot of money is going to be lost how many weworks are out there how many companies pretend to be winners but are actually hollow inside is uber one slack spotify could they be revealed in 2020 and harm the global economy in the process and all this is without mentioning donald trump brexit impeachment the trade war and the us election 2020 is going to be insanely busy finding out what happens

as we head in to 2020 many of us are focusing on one thing how to boost our net worth faced with challenging economic times the much warned about threat of recession basement level interest rates and

account dressing like departed apple deity steve jobs convincing people you re a technology company even when you re clearly not and good old fashioned breaking the law are just some of the easy ways you can turn your plucky young start up into a money printing machine without all the pesky added pressure of actually turning a profit but don t just take our advice smart people learn from their mistakes wise ones learn from those of others so here s a few places to get you started on the path to turning your simple idea into a slightly more complicated idea that venture capitalists will love so you want to be a tech billionaire the first thing you ll want to do if you re an aspiring tech billionaire is drop out of whatever university you re currently studying at preferably harvard bill

leave to focus on starting his company before actually dropping out of harvard meaning he could return to one of the world s most prestigious colleges if he failed zuckerberg however would be forced to rely on his parents a psychiatrist and a dentist if he fell on hard times though thankfully that never happened of course if you don t go to one of the most renowned universities in the world and have parents from wealthy professional backgrounds you may want to factor this into your swot analysis but really you should have thought of that before you decided to be born into those circumstances
