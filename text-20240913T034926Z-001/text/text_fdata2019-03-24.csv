in the early days of this millennium nr narayana murthy architect of the inspiring infosys success story was asked about the secret behind his company s remarkable wealth creation and resulting adulation among investors he remarked in his trademark pithy style under promise and over deliver this anecdote is striking in how the exact opposite is true of the narendra modi government over promise and under deliver that is a pithy summary of the economic outcome of the last five years as we approach the general election the year 2014 was a heady time for dreamers after a long time a politician was making economic development the core plank of his election campaign not caste or religion but a simple and powerful promise of making everyone s lot a bit better and weeding out corruption five years later what is the economic scorecard of the modi government we look at certain key indicators about the economic health of the country based on publicly available statistics from government or international sources gdp growth one of modi s main promises was to revive the economy and reverse the economic slowdown in the last years of the united progressive alliance government led by the congress what has been the outcome we have had different estimates of gross domestic product growth by different organisations such as the reserve bank of india world bank and central statistics office one notes in particular how in december 2018 the niti aayog in a highly unusual move released revised gdp figures attributed to the central statistics office which showed that the average growth rate over the same period was slightly higher 7 3 than previous official estimates then with only months left before the general election the central statistics office put out yet another set of revised estimates on january 31 that bumped up the average annual growth rate to 7 7 however if one looks at the world development indicators dataset of the world bank the reality is that in the last 15 years india s gdp growth rate has been above 7 in all but five years according to the world bank dataset which is considered one of the most authoritative internationally india s growth rate dipped below 7 right after the global financial crisis the last three years of the previous government the so called policy paralysis phase and in the year after demonetisation for a man who promised to unleash india s economic might on the world stage using the magic of modinomics to now boast of an average growth rate slightly above 7 according to the world bank data slightly below 7 according to the earlier central statistics office estimates presented in the latest rbi handbook and 7 7 according to the latest revised central statistics office estimates as a badge of achievement will not persuade anyone except the most diehard believers if we use a different benchmark and compare india s growth rate with the average growth rate across the world the last four years do not stand out yes india is one of the fastest growing economies in the world but that was true in the previous decade too the gap between india s growth rate and the global average growth rate or the south asian average growth rate has according to the world bank database shrunk not widened between 2014 and 2017 compared to what it was in the decade before 2014 in contrast bangladesh and vietnam have improved their relative growth performances with respect to the world average over the last four years compared to the decade before employment the debate about gdp growth rates however is really a distraction from the various indicators of the enormous distress affecting the majority of the population today that really is modi s biggest failure the number of people who are worse off after his tenure which no statistical chicanery about abstract indices like the gdp can hide therefore his economic scorecard is best assessed through the prism of what it has meant for indian citizens rather than through a statistical debate on current and past gdp numbers livelihood is the core issue for the majority of the population the promises about livelihood were ambitious 250 million jobs over 10 years or 25 million jobs a year if we look at a centre for monitoring indian economy series based on household surveys that is available since 2016 but does not go back before that the number of employed people declined from 406 7 million in 2017 to 406 2 million in 2018 and dropped further to 400 million in february 2019 in 2017 at least 1 8 million jobs were added but that is only 12 of the net addition to the pool of job seekers and a mere 7 of the annual job creation figure of 25 million promised by modi for 2016 the corresponding figure was 1 4 million a smaller sample of jobs data reported by companies the cmie s prowess dataset shows an average pace of job growth of 1 9 between 2014 and 2018 which is lower than the average for the decade before 2014 unemployment rate usual status year rate 1977 78 2 5 1983 84 1 9 1987 88 2 6 1993 94 1 9 1999 00 2 2 2004 05 2 3 2009 10 2 0 2011 12 2 2 2017 18 6 1 note this is for the age group of 15 and above the usual status is principal status plus subsidiary status source media reports of the national sample survey office s periodic labour force survey 2017 18 we are grateful to somesh jha of business standard for sharing the data with us in the absence of the full report being accessible we cannot judge the comparability of the data from the current round with those of past rounds in terms of any changes in sampling methodology if we look at data from government sources then according to the labour bureau the unemployment rate was at 3 7 in 2015 16 according to press reports on the latest national sample survey office survey the unemployment rate was at a four decade high of 6 1 in 2017 18 no wonder this report too is being withheld by the government despite having been approved by the national statistical commission two members of the commission have resigned in protest against the government s refusal to release the report more alarmingly nearly one in five rural or urban youth are unemployed according to this data the data coming as it does from official sources conclusively proves the modi government s track record on employment generation is nothing but an abysmal failure in urban and semi rural india where approximately 15 million young people are entering the job market every year this has created an environment of frustration and disillusionment the government s reaction has been to suppress this data at least until the election is out of the way but now the truth is out in the open this has also shaken the international community s faith in india s statistical apparatus which may have far reaching implications recently 108 noted economists from across the world wrote an open letter complaining that indian statistics were being manipulated for political considerations agriculture the problem is far worse of course in the agricultural sector that accounts for over half of india s workforce modi s assurance to indian farmers had been clear 50 profit over their cost of production and doubling of farm incomes by 2022 not only has this not been delivered the indian farm sector is crippled by a widespread crisis at an average of 2 51 for 2014 17 agricultural growth has been much lower under the modi government compared to the previous decade 2004 14 when growth averaged 3 7 or the decade before 1994 04 when the average was 2 88 it follows from simple mathematics that to double something in eight years a sustained growth rate of at least 9 is needed short of an agricultural revolution this was an absurd promise to start with and the performance is below par even by the performance of previous regimes rural wage growth rates are at a 10 year low and in 2018 growth was less than the rate of inflation that is it was negative in real terms prices of agricultural produce have increased at a much lower rate than that of non agricultural goods over this period and in the post demonetisation period crop prices have tended to be deflationary this has squeezed rural incomes and purchasing power relative to the non agricultural sector demonetisation cut off rural menfolk s migration options exacerbating what is surely one of the most severe agrarian crises of recent years industry the other major economic fault line of the last five years is the abysmally low growth of the corporate sector and its unwillingness or inability to invest in new capacity and jobs curiously even as the gdp numbers supposedly continue to grow at a reasonably healthy rate at least as per declared data corporate profits have languished over the last four years and most companies have massive unutilised capacity which is why they are loath to invest in more the gross capital formation which is the investment in plant and machinery has dropped sharply from 34 3 of the gdp in 2014 to 30 7 in 2017 the average of gross capital formation as a percentage of the gdp during the modi era is 31 8 this is considerably lower than the average during the decade of united progressive alliance rule of 39 non food bank credit charted an abysmally low trajectory through the last four years stifling economic growth if we look at the growth rate of credit to only industry the overall pattern looks similar to non food bank credit but the numbers look even worse when companies do not build new capacities and credit dries up jobs vanish which is precisely what is happening today if we look at other sources of demand that could potentially provide a boost to the economy such as exports there too we see a dip in performance under the modi regime since 2014 indian exports have grown at a dismal average pace of 1 6 while in the two decades preceding that it was 13 to 14 this in turn has led increased india s current account deficit to 2 9 of the gdp the key reason behind the rupee s collapse to 70 versus the american dollar yet comparing across the same periods countries such as bangladesh and vietnam were able to improve their performances in this dimension scaling up labour intensive manufacturing exports has helped them address their unemployment problem an area where we have failed make in india sounds good as a slogan but in reality the economic outlook under modi seems to be more like mess in india outside the organised sector the problem is graver medium and small enterprises and unorganised units were dealt a deathly blow by the prime minister s demonetisation scheme and have not yet recovered the cmie estimates that 3 5 million jobs were lost in the unorganised sector in the aftermath of demonetisation a ham handed implementation of the goods and services tax has only exacerbated this trend add to this the government s pathetic attempts at revamping the country s education system to ensure new graduates are employable government expenditure on education as a percentage of the gdp has dipped in the four years of the modi government and almost all news about education is about government interference with the running of institutions of higher education saffronisation and a backward looking it was all discovered in ancient india approach to science and technology poverty and inequality yet this is not the full picture to start with it is shocking that we do not have any government estimates of poverty since 2011 12 that aside what must be even more rankling for millions of indians struggling to eke out a modest livelihood is how fast the wealth of the rich keeps growing according to the world inequality database developed by thomas piketty and his colleagues in india the share of the bottom half of the population in total wealth is 6 4 according to the latest available data in contrast the share of the top 1 in total wealth is 30 not surprisingly the share of these groups in national income shows a similar gap the bottom 50 earn only 14 6 while the top 1 earn 21 what is even more alarming is that the share of the top 1 has been steadily rising at a rate that is much higher than how average wealth or income has been growing commensurately the share of the bottom 50 in both income and wealth has been steadily decreasing given this reality making promises like sabka saath sabka vikas without any concrete follow up actions adds to the pervasive sense of popular discontent with modi s economic record macro and fiscal management much is made of the government s fiscal rectitude how it has managed to rein in the fiscal deficit to 3 3 yes the modi government has marginally reduced the deficit to gdp ratio relative to the united progressive alliance but reports from the comptroller and auditor general of india suggest that this is largely due to creative accounting methods to roll over subsidy data and the windfall of falling oil prices that allowed it to raise fuel taxes without much protest if we look at tax revenue collection despite the government s claim about the rise in the number of indirect tax payers due to the gst the actual collections have not been impressive the growth in indirect tax collections accruing to the centre in the post gst era actually shows a decline an examination of the central board of direct taxation data suggests no significant increase in the number of income tax payers since 2013 14 despite the often heard claim that demonetisation led to a large increase in the number of income tax payers another oft repeated claim is that inflation was consistently higher under the previous government indeed if we take the annual inflation rate in consumer or retail prices as measured by the consumer price index the average for the united progressive alliance period was 8 1 while that for this government is 5 however if we take the difference between india s consumer price index inflation rate and the world average the corresponding figures are 3 7 and 3 1 for the two regimes therefore while some credit is indeed due to the modi government for fighting inflation this seemingly dramatic improvement can also be partly attributed to external factors affecting the global economy one remembers that the modi government has been very fortunate since it has experienced a decline in oil prices during most of its tenure it could have done so much with this lucky break but squandered the opportunity conclusion those reformwallahs who held their noses in 2014 to the toxic nature of hindutva politics in the hope that it was a price worth paying for economic reforms ignored this basic point about the economy sustained economic growth is impossible without social cohesion and a spirit of citizenship and solidarity five years down the line this is what we have job growth at a multi year low a farm crisis a crippled unorganised sector currency value at a near all time low a soaring current account deficit high interest rates a half frozen banking system a sputtering tax regime a struggling corporate sector sinking exports and a gdp growth rate that for all the constant revisions and data controversies associated with it does not stand out compared to the previous decade like the stock market one can create a bubble by stoking expectations however at some point the numbers need to add up that is why it is wise to under promise and over deliver as murthy believed when the fundamentals are not in sync with the expectations bubbles are bound to burst leaving behind a wreckage of broken promises and bitter disappointments it would not only be ironic if despite such a pitiful track record on the economy modi is voted back to power on the back of an exaggerated account of an air strike on pakistan but also make us deeply concerned about the underlying nature of our democracy and the policy choices for future governments of our country maitreesh ghatak is

dossiers gilets jaunes low visibility by james mcauley new york review of books __ twilight of the elites prosperity the periphery and the future of france by christophe guilluy translated from the french by malcolm debevoise yale university press 177 pp 25 00 _ march 21 2019 driving was already expensive in france when in january 2018 the government of president emmanuel macron imposed a tax that raised the price of diesel fuel by 7 6 centimes per liter and of gasoline by 3 8 centimes about 9 and 4 cents respectively further increases were planned for january 2019 the taxes were an attempt to cut carbon emissions and honor the president s lofty promise to make our planet great again priscillia ludosky then a thirty two year old bank employee from the seine et marne department outside paris had no choice but to drive into the city for work every day and the cost of her commute was mounting when you pay regularly for something it really adds up fast and the increase was enormous she told me recently there are lots of things i don t like but on that i pushed in late may 2018 she created a petition on change org entitled pour une baisse des prix du carburant à la pompe for a reduction of fuel prices at the pump over the summer ludosky s petition which acknowledged the entirely honorable aim of reducing pollution while offering six alternative policy suggestions including subsidizing electric cars and encouraging employers to allow remote work got little attention in the fall she tried again convincing a radio host in seine et marne to interview her if the petition garnered 1 500 signatures she posted that challenge on her facebook page and the signatures arrived in less than twenty four hours a local news site then shared the petition on its own facebook page and it went viral eventually being signed by over 1 2 million people éric drouet a thirty three year old truck driver and anti macron militant also from seine et marne created a facebook event for a nationwide blockade of roads on november 17 to protest the high fuel prices around the same time a fifty one year old self employed hypnotherapist named jacline mouraud recorded herself addressing macron for four minutes and thirty eight seconds and posted the video on facebook you have persecuted drivers since the day you took office she said this will continue for how long mouraud s invective was viewed over six million times and the gilets jaunes the yellow vests named for the high visibility vests that french drivers are required to keep in their cars and to wear in case of emergency were born even in a country where protest is a cherished ritual of public life the violence and vitriol of the gilets jaunes movement have stunned the government almost immediately it outgrew the issue of the carbon taxes and the financial burden on car reliant french people outside major cities in a series of saturday demonstrations that began in mid november and have continued for three months a previously dormant anger has erupted demonstrators have beaten police officers thrown acid in the faces of journalists and threatened the lives of government officials there has been violence on both sides and the european parliament has condemned french authorities for using flash ball guns against protesters maiming and even blinding more than a few in the crowds but the gilets jaunes have a flair for cinematic destruction in late november they damaged parts of the arc de triomphe in paris in early january they commandeered a forklift and rammed through the heavy doors of the ministry of state the only time in the history of the fifth republic that a sitting minister had to be evacuated from a government building the gilets jaunes are more than a protest this is a modern day jacquerie an emotional wildfire stoked in the provinces and directed against paris and most of all the elite french history since 1789 can be seen as a sequence of anti elite movements yet thegilets jaunes have no real precedent unlike the paris commune of 1871 this is a proletarian struggle devoid of utopian aspirations unlike the poujadist movement of the mid 1950s a confederation of shopkeepers likewise opposed to the americanization of a thieving and inhuman state and similarly attracted to anti semitic conspiracy theories the gilets jaunes include shopkeepers seemingly content to destroy shop windows there is an aspect of carnival here a delight in the subversion of norms a deliberate embrace of the grotesque many have said that the gilets jaunes are merely another populist movement although the term is now so broad that it is nearly meaningless comparisons have been made to the britain of brexit the united states of donald trump and especially the italy of cinque stelle but the crucial difference is that the gilets jaunes are apolitical and militantly so they have no official platform no leadership hierarchy and no reliable communications everyone can speak for the movement and yet no one can when a small faction within it fielded a list of candidates for the upcoming european parliamentary elections in may their sharpest opposition came from within to manygilets jaunes the ten who had put their names forward among them a nurse a truck driver and an accountant were traitors to the cause having dared to replicate the elite that the rest of the movement disdains concessions from the government have had little effect under mounting pressure macron was forced to abandon the carbon tax planned for 2019 in a solemn televised address in mid december he also launched the so called grand débat a three month tour of rural france designed to give him a better grasp of the concerns of ordinary people in some of these sessions macron has endured more than six hours of bitter criticisms from angry provincial mayors but these gestures have quelled neither the protests nor the anger of those who remain in the movement performance is the point during the early acts as the weekly demonstrations are known members refused to meet with french prime minister édouard philippe on the grounds that he would not allow the encounter to be televised and that sentiment has persisted perhaps the most telling thing about the gilets jaunes is the vest they wear a symbol of car ownership but more fundamentally a material demand to be seen inequality in france is less extreme than in the united states and britain but it is increasing among wealthy western countries the postwar french state l état providence is something of a marvel france s health and education systems remain almost entirely free while ranking among the best in the world in 2017 the country s ratio of tax revenue to gross domestic product was 46 2 percent according to statistics from the organization for economic co operation and development oecd the highest redistribution level of any oecd country and a ratio that allows the state to fight poverty through a generous social protection system of that 46 2 percent the french government allocated approximately 28 percent for social services the french social model is so integrated that it almost seems a natural preexisting condition alexis spire a sociologist of inequality at the école des hautes études en sciences sociales told me recently a number of the gilets jaunes i met said that despite the taxes they pay they do not feel they benefit from any social services since they live far from urban centers but anyone who has ever received housing assistance a free prescription or sixteen weeks of paid maternity leave has benefited from the social protection system the effect of redistribution is often invisible and yet the rich in france have gotten much richer between 1983 and 2015 the vast majority of incomes in france rose by less than one percent per year while the richest one percent of the population saw their incomes rise by 100 percent after taxes according to world bank statistics the richest 20 percent now earns nearly five times as much as the bottom 20 percent this represents a stark shift from the trente glorieuses france s thirty year economic boom after world war ii as the economist thomas piketty has pointed out between 1950 and 1983 most french incomes rose steadily by approximately 4 percent per year the nation s top incomes rose by only one percent what has become painfully visible however is the extent of the country s geographical fractures paris has always been the undisputed center of politics culture and commerce but france was once also a country that cherished and protected its vibrant provincial life this was la france profonde a clichéd but genuinely existing france of tranquil stone villages and local boulangeries with lines around the block on sundays douce france cher pays de mon enfance goes the beloved song by the crooner charles trenet mon village au clocher aux maisons sages these days the maisons sages are vacant and the country boulangeries are closed the story is familiar the arrival of large multinational megastores on the outskirts of provincial french towns and cities has threatened and in many cases asphyxiated local businesses 1 in the once bustling centers of towns like avignon agen calais and périgueux there is now an eerie quiet windows are often boarded up and fewer and fewer people are to be found this is the world evoked with a melancholy beauty in nicolas mathieu s novel leurs enfants après eux which won the prix goncourt france s most prestigious literary prize in 2018 the expansion since the 1980s of france s high speed rail network has meant that the country s major cities are all well connected to paris but there are many small towns where the future never arrived where abandoned nineteenth century train stations are now merely places for teenagers to make out monuments of the way things used to be in these towns cars are the only way people can get to work i met a fifty five year old truck and taxi driver named marco pavan in the franche comté in late november what he told me then about how carbon taxes can seem like sneers from the parisian elite has stayed with me ask a parisian for him none of this is an issue because he doesn t need a car pavan said there s no bus or train to take us anywhere we have to have a car i cited that remark in a washington post story i filed from besançon in the online comments section many attacked the movement for what they saw as a backward anti environmentalism missing his point few have written as extensively as the french geographer christophe guilluy on la france périphérique a term he popularized that refers both to the people and the regions left behind by an increasingly globalized economy since 2010 when he published fractures françaises guilluy has been investigating the myths and realities of what he calls the trompe l oeil of a peaceful moderate and consensual society he is one of a number of left wing french intellectuals among them the novelist michel houellebecq the historian georges bensoussan and the essayist michel onfray who in recent years have argued that their beloved patrie has drifted into inexorable decline a classic critique of the french right since 1789 but guilluy s decline narrative is different he is not as concerned as the others with islamist extremism or decadence broadly conceived for him france s decline is structural the result of having become a place where the social question disappears guilluy born in montreuil in 1964 is something of a rarity among well known french intellectuals he is a product of the paris suburbs not of france s storied grandes écoles and it is clear that much of his critique is personal as a child guilluy whose family then lived in the working class paris neighborhood of belleville was forcibly relocated for a brief period to the heavily immigrant suburb of la courneuve when their building was slated to be demolished in the midst of paris s urban transformation i saw gentrification firsthand he told le figaro in 2017 for the natives the natives being just as much the white worker as the young immigrant what provoked the most problems was not the arrival of magrebis but that of the bobos this has long been guilluy s battle cry and he has focused his intellectual energy on attacking what he sees as the hypocrisy of the bobos or bourgeois bohemians his public debut was a short 2001 column in libération applying that term coined by the columnist david brooks to french social life what was happening in major urban centers across the country he wrote then was a ghettoization by the top of society that excluded people like his own family guilluy crystallized that argument in a 2014 book that won him the ear of the élysée palace and regular appearances on french radio this was la france périphérique comment on a sacrifié les classes populaires in which he contended that since the mid 1980s france s working classes have been pushed out of the major cities to rural communities a situation that was a ticking time bomb partly as a result of rising prices he advanced that view further in 2016 with la crépuscule de la france d en haut now translated into english as twilight of the elites prosperity the periphery and the future of france a pithy screed against france s bobo elite and what he sees as its shameless embrace of a neoliberal americanized society and a hollow feel good creed of multicultural tolerance in 2018 one month before the rise of the gilets jaunes he published no society whose title comes from margaret thatcher s 1987 comment that there is no such thing as society in guilluy s view an immigrant working class has taken the place of the native working class in the banlieues on the outskirts of major cities this native class he argues has been scattered throughout the country and become an unnoticed presence that france s elite has made to disappear from public consciousness in order to consolidate its grip on power cities are now the exclusive preserve of the elites and their servants and what guilluy means by no society is that the visible signs of class conflict in urban daily life have vanished this is his trompe l oeil rich insulated parisians have convinced themselves that everything is fine while those who might say otherwise are nowhere near the simmering discontent of rural france has never really been taken seriously he writes in twilight of the elites since november much of the french press has declared that guilluy essentially predicted the rise of the gilets jaunes they seem after all a fulfillment of his prophecy about the betrayal of the people by the elites even if he is always elusive about who exactly the people are while critiques from the movement have remained a confused cloud of social media invective guilluy has served as its de facto interpreter no society puts into words what many in the gilets jaunes have either struggled or refused to articulate this is the hazy middle ground between warning and threat the populist wave coursing through the western world is only the visible part of a soft poweremanating from the working classes that will force the elites to rejoin the real movement of society or else to disappear for now however there is just one member of the elite whom the gilets jaunes wish would disappear and calls for his violent overthrow continue even as the movement s momentum subsides an intense and deeply personal hatred of macron is the only unifying cry among thegilets jaunes eighteen months before the uprising began this was the man who captured the world s imagination and who after populist victories in britain and the united states had promised a french third way yet the macronian romance is already over both at home and abroad to some extent the french always turn against their presidents but the anger macron elicits is unique this is less because of any particular policy than because of his demeanor and most of all his language mr macron always refused to respond to us muriel gautherin fifty three a podiatrist who lives in the paris suburbs told me at a december march on the champs élysées it s he who insults us and he who should respond when i asked her what she found most distasteful about the french president her answer was simple his words she has a point among macron s earliest actions as president was to shave five euros off the monthly stipends of france s aide personalisée au logement apl the country s housing assistance program around the same time he slashed france s wealth tax on those with a net worth of at least 1 3 million a holdover from the mitterand era macron came to office with a record of unrelentingly insulting the poor in 2014 when he was france s economic minister he responded to the firing of nine hundred employees most of them women from a breton slaughterhouse by noting that some were mostly illiterate in 2016 he was caught on camera in a heated dispute with a labor activist in the hérault when the activist gestured to macron s 1 600 suit as a symbol of his privilege the minister said the best way to afford a suit is to work in 2018 he told a young unemployed gardener that he could find a new job if he merely crossed the street yet nothing quite compares to the statement macron made in inaugurating station f a startup incubator in the thirteenth arrondissement of paris housed in a converted rail depot it is a cavernous consulate for silicon valley a soaring glass campus open to all those with big ideas who can also pay 195 a month for a desk and can fill out an application in fluent english we won t consider any other language the organization s website says google amazon and microsoft all have offices in it and in a city of terrible coffee the espresso is predictably fabulous in june 2017 macron delivered a speech there a train station he said referring to the structure s origins it s a place where we encounter those who are succeeding and those who are nothing this was the moment when a large percentage of the french public learned that in the eyes of their president they had no value ceux qui ne sont rien is a phrase that has lingered and festered to don the yellow vest is thus to declare not only that one has value but also that one exists on the whole the gilets jaunes are not the poorest members of french society which is not surprising as tocqueville remarked revolutions are fueled not by those who suffer the most but by those whose economic status has been improving and who then experience a sudden and unexpected fall so it seems with the gilets jaunes most live above the poverty line but come from the precarious ranks of the lower middle class a group that aspires to middle class stability and seeks to secure it through palliative consumption certain clothing brands the latest iphone the newest television in mid december le monde profiled a young couple in the movement from sens in north central france identified only as arnaud and jessica both twenty six they and their four children live in a housing project on the 2 700 per month that arnaud earns as a truck driver including more than 1 000 in government assistance according to statistics from france s institut national de la statistique et des études économiques insée this income places them right at the poverty line for a family of this size and possibly even slightly below it but the expenses arnaud and jessica told le mondethey struggled to pay included karate lessons for their oldest son and pet supplies for their dog jessica who does not work told le monde children are so mean to each other if they wear lesser brands i don t want their friends to make fun of them she said she had traveled to paris for gilet jaune protests on three separate weekends journeys that presumably cost her money readers of le monde many of them educated affluent and pro macron were quick to attack arnaud and jessica but the sniping missed their point which was that they felt a seemingly inescapable sense of humiliation fearing ridicule everywhere from the élysée palace to their children s school they were explaining something profound about thegilets jaunes the degree to which the movement is fueled by unfulfilled expectations for many demonstrators life is simply not as they believed it would be or as they feel they deserve there is an aspect of entitlement to the gilets jaunes who are also protesting what the french call déclassement the increasing elusiveness of the middle class dream in a society in which economic growth has not kept pace with population increase this entitlement appears to have alienated the gilets jaunes from immigrants and people of color who are largely absent from their ranks and whose condition is often materially worse 2 it s not people who don t have hope anymore who don t have a place to live or who don t have a job rokhaya diallo a french activist for racial equality told me recently describing the movement it s just that status they re trying to preserve the gilets jaunes have no substantive ideas resentment does not an ideology make they remain a combustible vacuum and extremist agitators on the far right and the far left have sought to capitalize on their anger both marine le pen of the recently renamed rassemblement national and jean luc mélenchon of the left wing la france insoumise have tried hard to channel the movement s grassroots energy into their own political parties but the gilets jaunes have so far resisted these entreaties the gilets jaunes also found themselves at the center of a diplomatic spat in early february italy s deputy prime minister luigi di maio met with two of their members on the outskirts of paris in a jab at macron two days later france withdrew its ambassador to rome for the first time since 1940 but the gilets jaunes have not attempted to exploit this attention for their own political gain instead there was infighting a twitter war over who had the right to represent the cause abroad and who did not the intellectual void at the heart of an amorphous movement can easily fill with the hatred of an other that may already be happening to the gilets jaunes although a careful analysis by le monde concluded that race and immigration were not major concerns in the two hundred most frequently shared messages on gilet jaune facebook pages between the beginning of the movement and january 22 a number of gilets jauneshave been recorded on camera making anti semitic gestures insulting a holocaust survivor on the paris metro and saying that journalists work for the jews importantly the gilets jaunes have never collectively denounced any of these anti semitic incidents a silence perhaps inevitable for a movement that eschews organization of any kind likewise a thorough study conducted by the paris based fondation jean jaurès has shown the extent to which conspiracy theories are popular in the movement 59 percent of those surveyed who had participated in a gilet jaune demonstration said they believed that france s political elites were encouraging immigration in order to replace them and 50 percent said they believed in a global zionist conspiracy members of the movement are often quick to point out that the gilets jaunes are not motivated by identity politics and yet anyone who has visited one of their demonstrations is confronted with an undeniable reality far too much attention has been paid to the symbolism of the yellow vests and far too little to the fact that the vast majority of those who wear them are lower middle class whites in what is perhaps the most ethnically diverse society in western europe can the gilets jaunes truly be said to represent the people as the members of the movement often claim priscillia ludosky arguably the first gilet jaune is a black woman it s complicated that question she told me i have no response the gilets jaunes are also distinctly a minority of the french population in a country of 67 million as many as 282 000 have demonstrated on a single day and that figure has consistently fallen with each passing week down to 41 500 during act 14 of the protest on february 16 on two different weekends in november and december other marches in paris one for women s rights the other against climate change drew far bigger crowds than the gilets jaunes did but the concerns of this minority are treated as universal by politicians the press and even the movement s sharpest critics especially after trump and brexit lower middle class and working class whites command public attention even when they have no clear message french citizens of color have been protesting social inequality for years without receiving any such respect in 2005 the killing of two minority youths by french police in the paris suburb of clichy sous bois ignited a string of violent uprisings against police brutality but the government declared an official state of emergency instead of launching a grand débat in 2009 the overseas departments of guadeloupe and martinique saw a huge strike against the high cost of living a forty four day uprising that also targeted fuel prices and demanded an increase to the minimum wage in 2017 an almost identical protest occurred in french guiana another french overseas department where residents demonstrated against household goods that were as much as 12 percent more expensive than they were in mainland france despite a lower minimum wage the french government was slow to respond in both of these instances while the concerns of the gilets jaunes have resulted in a personal apology from the president and a slew of concessions guilluy whose analysis of la france périphérique ultimately fails to grapple significantly with france s decidedly peripheral overseas territories does not shy away from the question of identity he sees a racial element to the frustrations of la france périphérique but he does not see this as a problem some of the most frustrating moments in his work come when he acknowledges but refuses to interrogate white working class behavior that seems to be racially motivated public housing in outlying communities is now a last resort for workers hoping to be able to go on living near the major cities he writes in twilight of the elites describing the recent astronomic rise in france s urban real estate prices these projects mostly occupied by immigrant renters are avoided by white french born workers barring some utterly unforeseeable turn of events their expulsion from the largest urban centers will be irreversible it would not diminish guilluy s broader point about la france périphérique if he acknowledged that victims of structural changes can also be intolerant guilluy also regularly recycles anxieties over immigration often from controversial theorists such as michèle tribalat who is associated with the idea of le grand remplacement the alleged great replacement of france s white population by immigrants from north and sub saharan africa in making his case about the demographic revolution in process guilluy has been accused of inflating his statistics france he wrote in fractures françaises welcomes a little less than 200 000 legal foreigners every year but these claims were attacked by patrick weil a leading french historian of immigration who noted in his book le sens de la république 2015 that guilluy failed to consider that a large number of those 200 000 are temporary workers students who come and go and others of irregular status guilluy has not responded to these criticisms and in any case his rhetoric has since grown more radical in no society he writes multiculturalism is intrinsically a feeble ideology that divides and weakens whether the gilets jaunes will eventually come to agree with him is a crucial question like guilluy they are responding to real social conditions but if following guilluy s lead they ultimately resort to the language of race and ethnicity to explain their suffering they will have chosen to become a different movement altogether one in which addressing inequality was never quite the point in some ways they have already crossed that line on the afternoon of saturday february 16 the prominent french intellectual alain finkielkraut got out of a taxi on the boulevard montparnasse a crowd of gilets jaunesnoticed him and began hurling anti semitic insults the scene recorded on video was chilling in the center of paris under a cloudless sky a mob of visibly angry men surrounded a man they knew to be jewish called him a dirty zionist and told him go back to tel aviv finkielkraut s parents were polish refugees from the holocaust he was born in paris in 1949 and has become a fixture in french cultural life a prolific author a host of a popular weekly broadcast on france culture and a member of the académie française the country s most elite literary institution in the words of macron who immediately responded to the attack he is not only an eminent man of letters but the symbol of what the republic affords us all the irony is that finkielkraut another former leftist who believes that france has plunged into inexorable decline and ignored the dangers of multiculturalism was one of the only parisian intellectuals who had supported the gilets jaunes from the beginning i spoke to finkielkraut after the attack and he explained that the gilets jaunes had seemed to him the evidence of something authentic i saw an invisible france neglected and forgotten he said wearing fluorescent yellow vests in order to be visible of being a somewhere as opposed to an anywhere as goodhart has said seemed to me an absolutely legitimate critique the british journalist david goodhart popular these days in french right wing circles is the author of the road to somewhere 2017 which sees populist anger as the inevitable response to the widening gulf between those rooted in a particular place and cosmopolitans at home anywhere france is not a start up nation finkielkraut told me it can t be reduced to that finkielkraut said that the attack was a sign that the reasonable critiques orginally made by the gilets jaunes had vanished and that they had no real future i think the movement is in the process of degradation it s no longer a social movement but a sect that has closed in on itself whose discourse is no longer rational although the paris prosecutor has opened an investigation into his attackers finkielkraut has not pressed charges he told me that the episode as violent as it was did not necessarily suggest that all those who had worn yellow vests in recent months were anti semites or extremists those who insulted me were not the nurses the shopkeepers or the small business owners he said noting that he doubted he would have experienced the same prejudice at the roundabouts the traffic circles across the country where gilets jaunes protesters gathered every saturday in a sense these were the essence of the movement which was an inchoate mobilization against many things but perhaps none so much as loneliness the roundabouts quickly became impromptu piazzas and a means however small of reclaiming a spirit of community that disappeared long ago in so many french towns and villages in paris where the remaining gilets jaunes have now focused most of their energy the weekly protests have become little more than a despicable theater filled with scenes like the attack on finkielkraut there is no convincing evidence that those still wearing yellow vests are troubled by the presence of bigotry in their ranks what is more many gilets jaunes now seem to believe that pointing out such prejudice is somehow to become part of a government backed conspiracy to turn public opinion against them consider for instance a february 19 communiqué released in response to the attack on finkielkraut from la france en colère one of the movement s main online bulletins for many days the government and its friends in the national media seem to have found a new technique for destabilizing public opinion and discrediting the gilets jaunes movement it begins we denounce the accusations and the manipulations put in place by this government adept at fake news but this is all the communiqué denounces it does not address the anti semitic violence to which finkielkraut was subjected nor does it apologize to a national figure who had defended the movement when few others of his prominence dared to do the same a month after our last conversation i called priscillia ludosky back to see if she had any reaction to the recent turn of events in the movement her petition had launched she was only interested in discussing what she called the french government s systematic abuse to manipulate public opinion she also believes that a government media conspiracy will stop at nothing to smear the cause if there was one person who ever said something homophobic it was on the front page of every newspaper she told me in the days after the attack finkielkraut lamented not so much the grim details of what had happened but the squandered potential of a moment that has increasingly descended into paranoid feverishness as he told me this was a beautiful opportunity to reflect on who we are that s been completely ruined february 21 2019 __ 1 this phenomenon has been widely discussed in france since the publication of the journalist olivier razemon s comment la france a tué ses villes rue de l échiquier 2016 no one has written more extensively on this question in english than my fellow correspondent adam nossiter see

that tactical shift towards at least some of the demands of the miners won for the republican roosevelt major blue collar support from ordinary working americans whose vote was becoming increasingly significant by f william engdahl the rights and interests of the laboring man will be protected and cared for not by the labor agitators but by the christian men to whom god in his infinite wisdom has given control of the property interests of the country george divine right baer jp morgan railroad executive in 1902 as the vast british empire went into a prolonged and seemingly irreversible decline following a major economic depression beginning in 1873 a challenge began to emerge from across the atlantic powerful american industrial and banking families grouped around j p morgan and john d rockefeller concentrated the wealth and control of american industry into their own hands in their rise to unprecedented heights of power the morgan and rockefeller interests deployed fraud deceit violence and bribery and they deliberately manipulated financial panics each financial panic brought about through their calculated control of financial markets and banking credit allowed them and their closest allies to consolidate ever more power into fewer and fewer hands it was this concentration of financial power within an elite few wealthy families that created an american plutocracy or more accurately an american oligarchy aristotle used the term oligarchy to describe rule by the wealthiest families where voting power in the state was related to the size of a family s fortune whether it was called an oligarchy or a plutocracy government by a wealthy class the real power in the spectacular rise of the american century at the end of the 1890s did not rest democratically in the hands of the majority of citizens it did not even lie in the hands of a broad educated and growing middle class power together with control over the nation s economy was being ruthlessly centralized in the hands of the wealthy few every bit as much as it had been in the days of imperial rome the more centralized that power became in the hands of an aristocracy of wealth the more it wrapped itself in the rhetorical garb of american democracy in one respect and one respect only the new american oligarchy was democratic it did not restrict entry to those of noble birth and bloodline as had been the case with the decadent nobility of ancient rome or pre revolutionary france the american constitution prohibited inherited titles of nobility and aristocracy it did not however prohibit an aristocracy of wealth either inherited or created like britain around the time of the founding of the private bank of england in 1694 this open admissions aristocracy would turn out to be a key factor in the dynamism of the emerging american empire the american century as henry luce was later to name it in the closing decades of the 19th century anyone clever determined and ruthless enough to win the darwinian survival of the fittest award by amassing a huge fortune and holding onto it was eligible for membership almost regardless of class religion or national origin race however remained a barrier to entry to the higher circles of power in america for at least another century this oligarchy used its immense economic power often secretly and in coordinated fashion to orchestrate events that generated waves of bankruptcies and severe economic depressions even panics the emerging american oligarchy cynically corrupted and co opted state legislatures governors us congressmen judges newspaper editors and even presidents to serve their private interests those interests were served by wars their captive press helped trigger wars from which that oligarchy profited while thousands of young americans perished for causes they knew nothing about the prevalent myth claimed that a rugged american frontier inspired the democratic and entrepreneurial spirit of the united states in the remarkable industrial expansion after the civil war in reality by the late 1870s after the enactment of the specie resumption act of 1875 which fully took effect in the year 1879 and which in effect put the united states on the london gold standard few countries had financial and economic power so concentrated in so few hands as did the united states by the 1880s two colossal groups had emerged within the united states wealthiest families initially they were bitter hated rivals in the end they became allies not out of love but out of practicality in one of the greatest concentrations of financial and industrial power ever seen the two families rockefeller and morgan created a combination of wealth and control so powerful in its influence over the economic and financial life of the united states at the beginning of the 20th century that congressional critics named it the money trust the engineered panic of 1893 the emergence of the morgan group as the decisive money power in the united states required years of covert and usually corrupt machinations the panic of 1893 led to a severe us economic depression that lasted four years it exemplified the lengths to which the emerging money trust around j p morgan was willing to go to amass concentrated power following the american civil war right up to the end of the 19th century the united states treasury recognized silver as well as gold as monetary metal the monetary system was in effect a bi metallic system silver existed in abundance in the western united states farmers and small shop owners advocated using silver to expand cheap credit to allow the economy to grow it made sense if expansion of the monetary base through the federal government were carefully guided however the influential new york bank syndicate headed in the 1890s by the house of morgan took the opposite position they saw gold especially in light of their close ties to leading london banks as their best road to dominant power over the money supply of the united states supplies of monetary gold were controlled by a handful of new york banks and by the financial powers of the city of london above all by the banking group of lord rothschild the new york bankers wanted no competition from silver their banking allies in the city of london the heart of the world gold standard at the time wanted america exclusively on a gold standard where their influence would be vastly greater london s new york banking allies j p morgan along with rothschild s us banking agent august belmont and others in new york finance shrewdly used their london banking associates to control american credit markets to their own exclusive advantage and to the distinct disadvantage of the general american public it was no easy challenge but they were single minded in their determination regarding the gold standard the infamous panic of 1893 was in fact manipulated by morgan interests in collusion with august belmont in order to end the role of silver and to consolidate the gold of the nation into the hands of the private new york banks in the course of manipulating several financial panics the same bankers also gained unprecedented control over the nation s steel and railroads the heart of the economy the point man for morgan and company was john g carlisle secretary of the treasury under democratic president grover cleveland cleveland a mediocre new york city politician before getting the financial backing of morgan and friends to become president was on intimate terms as president with two frequent private white house guests the two were j p morgan and august p belmont jr son of london rothschild s official banking agent in the united states august p belmont sr had been rumored in london society circles to be the illegitimate son of baron karl meyer rothschild who in any case had adopted the young belmont as if he were his son dispatching him to manage the rothschilds american business interests under the less controversial belmont name the one hand washes the other morgan s takeover of america s gold reserves began in 1893 following cleveland s second inauguration as president in early 1893 morgan and belmont secretly instigated a run on the us treasury s gold reserves colluding london banks acting via instructions from morgan and belmont right on cue sold the millions of us treasury securities they held and demanded payment in gold at the time the treasury by law was allowed to pay for redeemed bonds in either gold or silver the powerful silver lobby naturally urged that the treasury pay in silver not gold under the law the decision was left to the treasury secretary s discretion but secretary carlisle was getting his advice secretly from morgan and belmont as a result carlisle refused to redeem the bonds for silver which would have ended the gold hoarding panic instead he redeemed the securities exclusively in gold feeding further panic as us government gold stocks disappeared rapidly the consequence was that the us treasury s gold reserves vanished by april 1893 the reserves of gold fell below 100 million for the first time since resumption of specie payments in 1879 the trap had been masterfully set j p morgan and august belmont jr had convinced cleveland to have his treasury secretary john carlisle issue us treasury bonds exclusively to morgan and belmont in exchange the private bankers paid the treasury with gold that was urgently needed for the government s foreign reserves the prevailing practice was to maintain us treasury minimum gold reserves of 100 million anything below that being grounds for alarm over the stability of the dollar cleveland s treasury department sold the bonds to the private morgan banking syndicate at a steep discount the bankers in turn immediately resold the bonds at much higher prices to the investing public small regional banks insurance companies and others pocketing the huge profit from what amounted to an insider trade to complete the circle of corruption president cleveland s former law partner f l stetson represented j p morgan co for whom he negotiated the terms of the bond issues with the us treasury to call this arrangement a conflict of interest and violation of the public trust would be mild cleveland managed to sell a staggering 162 000 000 of such bonds to the morgan private syndicate at sweetheart prices before the anti corruption world the newspaper of journalist joseph pulitzer exposed the deals forcing an end to the highly profitable operation by may 1893 full scale panic had broken out across the united states some weeks later the government of india then a british colony announced that it would no longer accept silver to mint for coin india largely as a result of the earlier machinations of the british opium wars against china had become the world s largest holder of silver bullion the indian colony s rejection of silver gave an added boost to the london new york bankers plot to destroy once and for all the monetary role of silver in america it led to a catastrophic 50 fall in the international price of silver including in the united states there was more than a little suspicion within us circles hit by the money panic that certain banking houses of the city of london and new york which stood to gain handsomely from the gold panic had encouraged the indian government the crown jewel of her majesty s british empire to reject silver purchases in early 1895 the us treasury had again been emptied of its gold which it had just purchased at usurious rates from j p morgan co s banking syndicate where had the gold gone records of private gold holdings of the new york banks show that in january 1895 twenty six new york banks held in their vaults a hoard of 65 million of gold us treasury reserve minimum for gold at the time was 100 million to fall below that level as noted was considered dangerous for us financial stability president cleveland reportedly cried the banks have got the country by the throat he was careful not to reveal to the ignorant citizenry his help in giving the banks the rope at the critical moment a syndicate appeared with a generous proposal led by j p morgan company august belmont company representing the london rothschilds and james speyer of rockefeller s national city bank the syndicate offered to sell their private gold to the us treasury for a handsome profit of course the worst depression in us history the gold hoarding panic of 1893 resulted in a contraction of bank credit across america that triggered the worst economic depression in us history up to that time by law holders of us paper currency could redeem in gold from the us treasury as a result of the panic most banks feared to lend between may and october 1893 national bank loans contracted by an alarming 318 million rates on bank money hit 70 as banks and private individuals frantically sought gold exports of gold from the united states to the city of london were the heaviest in us history as london banks demanded gold as security for their us loans the gold panic severely cut into us government tax revenues increasing the deficit and forcing the treasury to use its increasingly scarce gold reserves to pay current expenses further impacting gold reserves the credit crisis led to a wave of business failures and bankruptcies across america from east to west as banks called in their loans western farmers and silver miners blamed eastern gold banks whom they believed secretly sought to discredit silver they were right on cue in august 1893 president cleveland advised by morgan and belmont called a special session of congress to repeal the sherman silver act under which the us treasury had bought silver in exchange for us treasury notes that in turn could be exchanged for gold by their bearers the sherman silver act had originally been passed under pressure from farmers and small businesses that faced depression and ruin as a result of the forced shift to an exclusively gold backed dollar cleveland successfully argued that by ending the government s silver purchase the nation would avert financial disaster predictably the opposite proved to be the case as silver which was in abundance was no longer a practical alternative to gold the sherman silver act was immediately repealed despite hefty protests from western and southern farmers and small businesses new york banks above all the morgan belmont syndicate had triumphed presidential candidate william jennings bryan later dramatically characterized this as being crucified on a cross of gold the victory of j p morgan belmont and their wall street cronies was formalized into law a monetary commission was set up in january 1897 the gold standard act introduced into the house of representatives in december 1899 was passed by congress and became law in march 1900 the act confirmed the gold dollar as the standard of value with silver as only a subsidiary coinage president cleveland arranged for morgan to create a private syndicate on wall street to supply the us treasury with 65 million in gold half of it from europe to float a bond issue that restored the treasury surplus of 100 million the treasury bonds were sold at rock bottom sweetheart prices exclusively to the morgan belmont syndicate not to the general public morgan then resold the bonds at hefty premium to smaller regional banks and insurance companies making a handsome profit at both ends of the deal at the expense of the economic health of the nation during the ensuing great depression of 1893 lasting for four full years spending for capital goods collapsed profits plunged and depression hit the cities en masse over the course of this depression 15 000 businesses 600 banks and 74 railroads failed there was severe unemployment and wide scale protesting which in some cases turned violent at the peak of the ensuing unemployment an unprecedented 14 5 of the active labor force was out of work some estimates put the jobless figure as high as 25 the deliberately engineered economic collapse of the philadelphia and reading railroads had been the first step in the oligarchy s consolidation of railroad ownership j p morgan had organized a credit boycott of the railroad triggering a sharp fall in the rail s stock at which point morgan quietly bought controlling shares at dirt cheap prices the rail was linked to vast anthracite coal deposits in pennsylvania meanwhile in the midst of the gold panic by may 15 1893 stock prices in the new york stock exchange reached an all time low this included major railroads many of which such as the union pacific northern pacific and santa fe railroads were forced to declare bankruptcy the chain of major railroad bankruptcies across america provided the golden opportunity for the highly solvent banks of the morgan belmont syndicate to consolidate their iron grip over the expanding us railway network at that time the heart of the american economic expansion america s oligarchy the sixty families america s business tycoons emerged in the economic boom years following the civil war of 1861 65 and the specie resumption act of 1875 accumulating and consolidating vast fortunes largely through fraud bribery of public officials and congress corruption forced bankruptcies and other noble practices railroads were the heart of american economic growth and they fed the expansion of a large and growing steel industry the telegraph also required huge tonnages of copper for the wires across the nation as rail ties expanded from east to west most of the great railroad lines were built not with morgan money but with public taxes and gifts of public lands j p morgan then captured these railways and thereby achieved vital control over the entire united states economy by 1901 the morgan group controlled the southern railway mobile ohio railroad queen crescent georgia central georgia southern florida macon birmingham philadelphia reading the erie the central of new jersey and the atlantic coast line a total of more than 55 000 miles of steel rail track that controlled railroad rights of way access to coal lands terminals competing lines and steamship connections the emerging caste of american oligarchs draped themselves in the rhetoric of american democracy they carefully fostered the myth of rugged individualism and free enterprise to justify their huge gains and cover their fraudulent origins by the end of the 1890 s morgan and rockefeller had become the giants of an increasingly powerful money trust controlling american industry and government policy there was little room for the actual practice of democracy in their world power was the commodity of their trade it was the creation of an american aristocracy of blood and money every bit as elite and exclusive as the titled nobility of britain germany or france despite the constitutional ban on titled nobility in america it was an oligarchy a plutocracy in every sense of the word rule by the wealthiest in their self interest some 60 families names like rockefeller morgan dodge mellon pratt harkness whitney duke harriman carnegie vanderbilt dupont guggenheim astor lehman warburg taft huntington baruch and rosenwald formed a close network of plutocratic wealth that manipulated bribed and bullied its way to control the destiny of the united states at the dawn of the 20th century some sixty ultra rich families through dynastic intermarriage and corporate interconnected shareholdings had gained control of american industry and banking institutions one of the wealthiest of the new american oligarchs was cornelius vanderbilt who created his fortune through bribing state legislators to ignore laws prohibiting preferential freight rates to preferred customers vanderbilt at the time controlled all rail lines that connected to new york city to promote and benefit from the greater profit margins of large enterprises and squeeze out the smaller ones vanderbilt used a variety of tactics among his methods was to impose a 50 tax on small farmers to ship milk on vanderbilt s railroads farmers were not preferred customers emerging large agribusiness groups who got valderbilt s preferred rates were vanderbilt later became an appendage of the j p morgan circle another fortune of the day built on fraud and bribery was that of the phelps and dodge families and their phelps dodge company importers of metals such as tin copper and lead needed to feed the american construction boom of the 1880s and beyond founded in 1834 by anson greene phelps and william e dodge the company went to great lengths to cultivate the image of being run by god fearing christian businessmen who donated their efforts to the young men s christian association and other philanthropy in reality as an 1873 us government trial determined the phelps dodge fortune was built on a mountain of fraud illegalities and bribery a us district court in new york fined the company 1 million a huge sum in those days for defrauding us customs by under valuing the copper that phelps dodge imported from peru and chile the company had bribed us customs officials to facilitate the deal depriving the us government of significant import tax revenue the list of american fortunes built on such fraud corruption and bribery of government officials was long it included the most famous names in america men who donated money to the nation s museums endowed its finest universities like princeton yale harvard with professorships or had buildings and sometimes entire universities named after them in this way they created the image of philanthropy and good works while the reality was quite different this small elite group included railroad magnate edward h harriman father of averell harriman us diplomat spy and confidential adviser to franklin d roosevelt e h harriman used illegal means to gain control of the union pacific trans continental railway along with his southern pacific company by watering down stock shares and using bookkeeping tricks that would make enron s auditors envious harriman built an empire that controlled no fewer than seventeen major us railways a 1907 us government report stated that harriman s aim in acquiring so many rail lines was to eliminate competition between them in transcontinental business the monopolistic restraint of competition violated both federal and state laws anti trust act turned against labor such abuses became the focus of newspaper investigations and public outrage towards the end of the 19th century culminating in the sherman anti trust act passed by congress in 1890 the law appeared to be aimed at reining in the practices associated with the standard oil trust the us steel trust of morgan the sugar trust and the like the trusts had been formed as a way for large corporations to protect their profits by combining with their competitors to set prices and control production the first trust had been rockefeller s standard oil formed in 1882 soon similar combinations or trusts were formed in tobacco beef whiskey steel mining sugar and other industries on the surface the sherman anti trust act seemed to be aimed at corrupt monopolists like morgan or rockefeller or harriman the reality was just the opposite as early as 1895 the supreme court diluted the effect of the sherman act by ruling in united states v e c knight that manufacturing was not considered interstate commerce even though the manufactured goods were shipped all over the united states this decision effectively put key industries beyond the reach of government regulation a wave of mergers at the end of the 19th century engulfed most of us manufacturing resulting in a few hundred huge corporations dominating the landscape the biggest trust was northern securities corporation of new jersey it was the umbrella enclosing 112 corporations worth 22 billion in assets and it was controlled by j p morgan and john d rockefeller in an apparent assault on this particular trust the us supreme court declared in its 1904 decision northern securities co v united states that all combinations in restraint of trade were illegal while it broke up one railroad trust the ruling clearly benefitted others particularly e h harriman the sherman anti trust act never in the least hindered harriman or the other corporate giants the law was a political charade to defuse public anger the influential harriman and his friends remained exempt from anti trust prosecution while numerous small business owners were sent to prison under the act egregiously the sherman anti trust act was also turned into a weapon to block the expansion of trade unions in the us as the supreme court ruled that striking unionists were a combination in restraint of trade the climate fostered by morgan and his oligarchic cronies against any attempt by their workers to organize for better working conditions or wages or even unions was repressive in the extreme the us supreme court was a bastion of oligarchic conservatism in 1905 in lochner v new york the court ruled that states were not allowed to restrict working hours in private businesses and three years later in the 1908 danbury hatters case it ruled unions were forbidden to boycott to obtain better wages and working conditions in 1902 indicative of the prevailing climate george baer the man j p morgan installed as head of his philadelphia and reading railway was named by the pennsylvania coal operators to lead negotiations with striking coal miners anthracite coal was transported to numerous cities via the philadelphia reading in the decades before the dominance of petroleum coal was the essential energy source used for home heating cooking powering factories and generating electric power the mine workers were demanding an eight hour day a ten percent pay increase and recognition of the united mine workers union as their future bargaining agent with management they resorted to the only weapon they had withholding their labor to press for relief baer won the nickname george divine right baer when he sent an open letter to the press at the start of talks with the striking miners declaring the rights and interests of the laboring man will be protected and cared for not by the labor agitators but by the christian men to whom god in his infinite wisdom has given control of the property interests of the country baer like morgan rockefeller carnegie and most of their peers at the time was a convinced social darwinist who believed god had chosen them as they had manifestly proved superior to their workers by virtue of their control of their businesses and their accumulated wealth baer told president teddy roosevelt who had been called in to negotiate a solution that there was nothing to negotiate only when baer s stubbornness threatened a national backlash in favor of the striking miners did morgan intervene together with the politically shrewd roosevelt to force a settlement with labor one that gave concessions on hours and pay but refused union recognition the anthracite strike and the supreme court rulings indicated the extremely one sided nature of labor management relations in turn of the century america it was an oligarchy that ruled by bribery threats and brute force they had yet to learn the subtle skills of co optation and liberal reform to maintain their grip on power with public sentiment overwhelmingly behind the cause of the miners theodore roosevelt proclaimed his square deal between management and labor let the watchwords of all our people be the old familiar watchwords of honesty decency fair dealing and common sense we must treat each man on his worth and merits as a man we must see that each is given a square deal because he is entitled to no more and should receive no less the square deal established the principle of presidential intervention in certain strikes and it made for good press while roosevelt the rough rider continued his backroom deals with j p morgan and company tr as he was popularly known was the self proclaimed hero of the battle of san juan hill in the spanish american war of 1898 a nakedly imperialist venture that had made roosevelt a popular political candidate that tactical shift towards at least some of the demands of the miners won for the republican roosevelt major blue collar support from ordinary working americans whose vote was becoming increasingly significant but teddy roosevelt had in no way changed his allegiance to the powers of great wealth he was merely a shrewd politician who sensed which way the winds of change in the country were blowing and masterfully exploited it to retain republican control of the executive this period would be misleadingly labeled the beginning of the progressive era in american politics in reality the oligarchic families controlling the nation s wealth were beginning to become more sophisticated about how they projected their image none was more shrewd in that endeavor than j p morgan no american business giant of that day could hold a candle to the greatest fraudster and swindler in american financial history at that time junius pierpont morgan
america s apparent retreat from championing globalization along with its lesser enthusiasm to sustain the postwar economic and security architectures that it helped establish and lead has created openings for china as the world s number two to take on greater international responsibilities consequent with its rise against this backdrop leadership transition and political developments in china has become closely watched events by an international community eager to find clues on future policy directions china may take will china become bolder in taking greater regional and global commitments as its pronouncements and actions suggest or will it be more cautious and circumspect given the risks and uncertainties is president xi jinping s third term a move towards stability and continuity or is it another disruption in a world already fraught with considerable unpredictability xi s third term broke the post deng tradition of term limits and as such is considered a disruptive development in domestic politics though there had been different accounts on the motive behind the move the need for steady hands amidst uncertain times is one potent explanation the united states is in decline not so much in terms of capacity but rather largely by choice in the meantime china s economy continues to gather strength but dangers in the transition to a new normal still cast a long shadow in ongoing reforms therefore the need for stability and continuity to take greater advantage of the period of strategic opportunity is imperative the disruptive impact of xi s third term in china s leadership succession is thus dampened by the perceived benefits of its intended purpose meanwhile in the international realm xi s third term suggest strong policy continuity eroding traditional norms and order china s growing economic power and political influence have tremendous disruptive effect but this disruption can be good or bad depending on where one sits the inflexibility of western led global governance to accommodate emerging powers has encouraged the latter to establish parallel regional and global economic and security platforms that gives due regard to their voices and interests xi s new asian security concept and community of shared destiny for mankind while remaining nebulous and still largely aspirational is tapping into a strong undercurrent of exclusion domestic interference and inequality in the current security framework his asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and belt and road initiative bri are responding to tremendous demand for infrastructure finance long deserted by the bretton woods multilateral development institutions thus while there is no question that china s rise contributes to the erosion of the traditional western led global order and the values they underpin the dormant seeds for that attrition have long been there it is arguable whether china desires to supplant the existing order with its own or if it simply wants meaningful reforms to take place to reflect the changing times china is the world s largest crude oil importer and it makes sense for china to encourage purchases be done in yuan but even this will not catapult the renminbi to the top from its present position in the lower rung of the world s most traded currencies hence its immediate disruptive impact tends to be overhyped although long term potential is present especially if this strategy will be replicated in other key commodities that china is a major consumer and importer of furthermore whether chinese backed initiatives constitute a better alternative to the prevailing order or if they are even ready to substitute for the latter remain to be established those who view chinese intentions with suspicion who think china wittingly or unwittingly may embolden challenges to long standing rights market and governance norms may thus see china s international activities as bad disruption challenging the order to reform however a case for a positive disruption can also be made six of the world s top ten fastest growing economies have china as their main trade partner fast growing asian and sub saharan african economies are strategically located rich in natural resources and possessing a youthful demography but lacking in terms of capital goods are getting a big lift from china s connectivity projects chinese built railways provided landlocked ethiopia and zambia outlets to the sea for their trade while helping china diversify its energy and trade routes and mitigate its malacca dilemma the china pakistan economic corridor is helping pakistan develop its transport and energy backbone the success of china s late entry into development finance is encouraging a rethinking on the part of traditional donors but while it may be too late for japan the united states and europe to compete with china in terms of scale they surely can contribute in enhancing governance and the absorptive capacity of host states as well as holding conversations on quality environment and labor standards in this way western criticism over such projects will be seen as more constructive instead of obstructionist the aiib s joint financing with the asian development bank and other multilateral lending institutions are encouraging signs illustrating that china s disruption is not necessarily anti establishment besides the pie is still too big there is plenty of room for the west to pool their funds to take part in the emerging infrastructure boom this would be welcomed by the global south more funders mean more choices while american firms may not be able to deliver turnkey projects they surely can participate as consortium partners with chinese japanese or korean general contractors for infrastructure projects financed or co financed by china on the security front the shanghai cooperation organization provides china russia and central asian nations a venue to jointly address threats posed by terrorism separatism and extremism which have strong resonance in the west as well and this cooperation platform has now expanded to include south asia furthermore more than the financial largesse china s industrial technological and labor capacity make it a combo development partner its manufacturing might enable it to mass produce renewable energy technologies although intellectual property rights remain an issue to make sustainable and clean energy more accessible to developing countries rising wages and increasing focus on services and high technology help facilitate the export of china s excess industrial capacity especially labor intensive sectors like textiles clothing and shoes to developing countries creating jobs and sowing the seeds for nascent industries while such outsourcing may hollow out china s enormous manufacturing capacity anytime soon unlikely as that may seem spreading out its production overseas may help lessen the country s ability to dump cheaply produced china made surplus goods something which is attributed to a driving out of competition and accumulation of trade deficit by key trade partners knowledge and technology transfers in the operation and management of chinese built utilities allow a diffusion of learning and enable host states to have greater ownership of their assets long term leases may constitute china s risk mitigation measure especially when investing in volatile regions and post conflict states but it also means that china will play an active not a bystander role in making the investments pay off bri is not a charity and beijing has little interest in debt accumulation when its own economy is already overleveraged building industrial parks and free trade economic zones open to all to be serviced by the railways and ports can thus be taken as a measure to accelerate business and generate traffic which can have a transformative effect on host economies that said prudence and evaluating the capacity to pay for these developments should be seriously considered to avoid charges of ensnaring host states into debt bondage ensuring convergence with the national development plans of host states will also avoid accusations of china simply railroading its way in building a network of regional and global connectivity in sum while xi s era will promote domestic stability and foreign policy continuity it will undoubtedly pose challenges to the western led world order that has changed little since the postwar period but before responding to these challenges in both the economic and security domains the west may see value in looking at the order it had built and championed over the years to evaluate the shortcomings that made chinese initiatives gain traction finally although china s disruption tends to be overly seen in the prism of great power competition its positive but still nuanced impact especially in the developing world and its potential complementary role remains underappreciated lucio blanco pitlo iii is a research fellow at the asia pacific pathways to progress foundation and contributing editor reviews for the asian politics and policy journal he is also a

airbus is considering whether or not to shift the assembly process of its latest generation of a330 planes to china as part of a bid to increase its market share in the world s fastest growing civil aviation market the european multinational is following a trend started by boeing which recently opened a new completion plant in china on the face of it the decision by the two companies which dominate the civilian aviation market makes sense build where your biggest customer lives especially as china does not yet have a fully homegrown civil aviation industry ready to compete globally the benefits are many including the goodwill and esteem of the country that would be buying these planes in the long term however that might prove to be a costly miscalculation based on its recent history here and here it won t take long for china to catch up and largely displace both companies domestically in beijing s home aviation market as well as seizing a large chunk of the corporate duopoly s global market share airbus and boeing could therefore be making short term decisions with negative long term consequences for their future profitability given china s formidable economic advancement none of this should come as a surprise to either airbus or boeing nor should it shock western governments the problem is that everybody has historically been guided by the naïve assumption that simply admitting china to organizations such as the world trade organization wto would induce beijing to in the words of philip pan eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring china into the fold of democratic nations or the chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot china has unquestionably modernized but its politically illiberal dirigiste polity has if anything massively moved in the opposite direction strengthened by that very modernization process that has done anything but falter furthermore the country has many aims and goals that are antithetical to the long term prosperity of western companies and economies as the european union is beginning to recognize boeing and airbus might simply become the latest western sacrificial lambs beijing has explicitly targeted wide bodied aircrafts as one of its 10 new priority sectors for import substitution in its made in china 2025 document so whatever short term gains airbus and boeing receive in terms of securing additional orders from china could well be undermined longer term the resultant technology transfers and lower labor costs will almost certainly give beijing a quantum leap toward competing directly and ultimately displacing both companies given the merger with mcdonnell douglas boeing will continue its march toward effectively becoming a branch of the u s department of defense as its civilian market share crashes but airbus doesn t really have the luxury of a military alternative given the relative paucity of european defense expenditures as if boeing needed any further problems the 737 fiasco represents the latest in a series of setbacks for the company boeing s 737 global recall coming on the heels of the initial launch problems of the 787 dreamliner some six years ago where the demoduralization of production meant that boeing could not fully account for stress transmission and loading at the system level as gary pisano and willy shih write together illustrate the dangers of spreading manufacturing too far across the globe engineers notes cuny fellow jon rynn need to kick the tires of the new production processes they design so while a market may be global production and the growth of production take place most efficiently in relatively close geographic quarters american companies such as boeing consistently underestimate the value of closely integrating r d and manufacturing while underplaying the risks of separating them as recent events have demonstrated again to the company s cost by deciding to expand its a330 production in china airbus looks poised to repeat boeing s error a potential miscalculation that most european union companies have hitherto largely avoided because the eu has prioritized domestic manufacturing discouraged offshoring more than its u s counterparts in regard to the loss of u s manufacturing jobs attributable to china the american economic review paper by justin r pierce and peter k schott specifically notes that there was no similar reaction in the european union where policy did not change beijing itself has historically balanced its purchases from both major civil aviation manufacturers to ensure that it does not rely too heavily on one aircraft supplier which means that airbus will likely benefit from the void created by the 737 recall all the more reason why the european conglomerate should be wary of following the pied piper like expansion into china the 737 recall also complicates resolution of the u s china trade conflict which had appeared closer to resolution in light of beijing s proposal to buy an additional 1 2tn in u s exports over six years boeing aircraft purchases featured heavily on beijing s shopping list but the longer term challenges relate to china s economic development path and its corresponding move up the high tech curve which have largely been characterized by mercantilist policies of protection and heavy government subsidy in this regard the chinese state has followed a national development strategy first outlined in the mid 19th century by the german economist friedrich list who argued that the national government should play a crucial role in promoting guiding and regulating the process of national economic advancement protectionism list argued should play a role here as well during the country s catch up phase of technological development list wrote the analysis against a historic backdrop where germany was beginning to challenge the dominant economic power of its time the united kingdom so the defenders of beijing might well point to his work to show that there is nothing new about using the state as a principal instrument to accelerate economic development and innovation however list was analyzing two capitalist economies operating within the context of a 19th century gold standard global financial system which invariably circumscribed the scope of state involvement the finite availability of gold reserves limiting fiscal policy options by contrast today the global economy operates under a fiat currency system and what therefore distinguishes china s economic domestic development from its 19th century predecessors is the sheer scale of fiscal resources it can deploy in the furtherance of its economic and military objectives some of these objectives might not be so benign to the west longer term which points to another consideration for the west for all of its supposed embrace of capitalism china is still primarily a state dominated economy which eschews the disciplines of a free market economy this means it has the capacity and ideological predisposition to use the national fiscal policy as a loss leader absorbing losses well beyond what would be tolerated in an economy dominated by private enterprise private companies of course can go bust beijing underwrites its designated national champions by relying on a combination of subsidies some disguised as they flow through state backed investment funds and the financial sectors and buy china preferences to develop chinese products even though these policies are contrary to the rules of wto membership which china eagerly joined in 2001 as the economist brad setser argues various parts of the chinese state compete absorb losses and then consolidat around the successful firms other countries worry about the losses notes setser but not the chinese government which simply socializes the losses at the national level and writes them off in this regard boeing and airbus would do well to consider china s experience in the solar industry designating this as another strategic sector for growth in the 1990s chinese solar companies with the explicit backstop of the state ultimately raised enough funding via debt to build sufficient solar capacity for the world three times over the overinvestment ultimately killed the cash flows of major western competitors and knocked them out of the business leaving the market free for china to dominate commenting on the trend scientific american highlighted that between 2008 and 2013 china s fledgling solar electric panel industry dropped world prices by 80 percent a stunning achievement in a fiercely competitive high tech market china had leapfrogged from nursing a tiny rural oriented solar program in the 1990s to become the globe s leader in what may soon be the world s largest renewable energy source here was a classic case of state guided supported commercial companies receiving benefits that went far beyond anything in say korea or taiwan or even japan in the earlier part of their development now this trend is manifesting itself across the entire spectrum of the chinese guided economy including agricultural equipment industrial machinery telecommunications ai computer chips and civil aviation in another disturbing parallel that boeing and airbus would do well to consider he timeline of china s rise began in the late 1990s when germany overwhelmed by the domestic response to a government incentive program to promote rooftop solar panels provided the capital technology and experts to lure china into making solar panels to meet the german demand according to scientific american much like the german solar companies which shipped valuable manufacturing and technological expertise to china to sustain demand boeing and airbus could well be signing their economic death warrants by agreeing to offshore increasing amounts of production in china to sustain their global market shares aided and abetted by their more market oriented governments which frown on the idea of national industrial policy the same thing is happening in wind power in china which is expected to see offshore wind capacity grow from 2 gigawatts last year to 31 gigawatts in the next decade china s expansion here has already forced siemens and gamesa to merge to cope with the rising competitive challenge as far as aviation itself goes setser makes the point that china may cut into the united states future exports by building its own competitor to the 737 and also cut into europe s future exports if airbus decides to build the a330 in china and china buys made in china rolls royce engines for the c929 and the a330 even if this allows the duopoly to maintain its dominance in global civil aviation it is hard to see how shifting manufacturing production of aircraft components to china to get orders constitutes a win for the u s or european workers who are already being displaced and boeing s weak kneed response to the 737 crisis will likely exacerbate the company s problems going forward the bottom line is that both western governments and western corporations have persistently underestimated the power of china s economic development model and the corresponding economic threat that it poses to the west s own affluence the usual criticism leveled against the chinese growth model is that a country that subsidizes its industries ends up with inefficient industries because heavily protected local firms are shielded from global competition ultimately leaving the country that resorts to protectionism with inferior products the idea of national champions built up via state dirigisme according to classic liberal economic doctrine ultimately ensures that economic efficiency and commercial considerations get squeezed out rent seeking and corruption become institutionalized goes the argument so these national champions ultimately will not be able to compete in the global marketplace that was certainly the assumption of milton friedman who called the chinese communist party s state driven strategy an open invitation to corruption and inefficiency by contrast according to defense and the national interest the governing assumptions of capitalist economies is that he discipline of the marketplace not the state is better suited to choose winners and knock out losers who cannot offer the prices or quality or features of their competitors china represents the ultimate repudiation of these seemingly ironclad economic laws the country s success has come across a slew of industries clean tech notably wind and solar power internet companies despite overwhelming censorship china has corporate behemoths such as alibaba or baidu which rival google in scale and scope and more recently in the telecommunications sector where huawei has clearly benefited from buy china preferences created by the state via its state owned telecommunications enterprises and now is considered to be the global leader in 5g telephony in practice therefore there is no reason why the same model cannot work with regard to civil aviation even as airbus and boeing eagerly provide the rope with which they may hang their respective companies in the future
as alarm bells sound over the advancing destruction of the environment a variety of green new deal proposals have appeared in the us and europe along with some interesting academic debates about how to fund them monetary policy normally relegated to obscure academic tomes and bureaucratic meetings behind closed doors has suddenly taken center stage the 14 page proposal for a green new deal submitted to the us house of representatives by congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez does not actually mention modern monetary theory but that is th it s e approach currently capturing the attention of the media and taking most of the heat the concept is good abundance can be ours without worrying about taxes or debt at least until we hit full productive capacity but the devil is in the details mmt advocates say the government does not need to collect taxes before it spends it actually creates new money in the process of spending it and there is plenty of room in the economy for public spending before demand outstrips supply driving up prices critics however say this is not true the government is not allowed to spend before it has the money in its account and the money must come from tax revenues or bond sales in a 2013 treatise called modern monetary theory 101 a reply to critics mmt academics actually concede this point but they write that these constraints do not change the end result and here the argument gets a bit technical their reasoning is that the fed is the monopoly supplier of cb currency treasury spends by using cb currency and since the treasury obtained cb currency by taxing and issuing treasuries cb currency must be injected before taxes and bond offerings can occur the counterargument made by american monetary institute researchers among others is that the central bank is not the monopoly supplier of dollars the vast majority of the dollars circulating in the united states are created not by the government but by private banks when they make loans the fed accommodates this process by supplying central bank currency bank reserves as needed and this bank created money can be taxed or borrowed by the treasury before a single dollar is spent by congress the ami researchers contend all bank reserves are originally created by the fed for banks government expenditure merely transfers previous bank reserves back to banks as the federal reserve bank of st louis puts it federal deficits do not require that the federal reserve purchase more government securities therefore federal deficits per se need not lead to increases in bank reserves or the money supply what federal deficits do increase is the federal debt and while the debt itself can be rolled over from year to year as it virtually always is the exponentially growing interest tab is one of those mandatory budget items that taxpayers must pay predictions are that in the next decade interest alone could add 1 trillion to the annual bill an unsustainable tax burden to fund a project as massive as the green new deal we need a mechanism that involves neither raising taxes nor adding to the federal debt and such a mechanism is actually proposed in the us green new deal a network of public banks while little discussed in the us media that alternative is being debated in europe where green new deal proposals have been on the table since 2008 european economists have had more time to think these initiatives through and they are less hampered by labels like socialist and capitalist which have long been integrated into their multiparty systems a decade of gestation in europe the first green new deal proposal was published in 2008 by the new economics foundation on behalf of the green new deal group in the uk the latest debate is between proponents of the democracy in europe movement 2025 diem25 led by former greek finance minister yanis varoufakis and french economist thomas piketty author of the best selling capital in the 21st century piketty recommends funding a european green new deal by raising taxes while varoufakis favors a system of public green banks varoufakis explains that europe needs a new source of investment money that does not involve higher taxes or government deficits diem25 proposes for this purpose an investment led recovery or new deal program to be financed via public bonds issued by europe s public investment banks e g the new investment vehicle foreshadowed in countries like britain the european investment bank and the european investment fund in the european union etc to ensure that these bonds do not lose their value the central banks would stand ready to buy them above a certain yield in summary diem25 is proposing a re calibrated real green investment version of quantitative easing that utilises the central bank public development banks already have a successful track record in europe and their debts are not considered debts of the government they are financed not through taxes but by the borrowers when they repay the loans like other banks development banks are moneymaking institutions that not only don t cost the government money but actually generate a profit for it diem25 collaborator stuart holland observes while piketty is concerned to highlight differences between his proposals and those for a green new deal the real difference between them is that his however well intentioned are a wish list for a new treaty a new institution and taxation of wealth and income a green new deal needs neither treaty revisions nor new institutions and would generate both income and direct and indirect taxation from a recovery of employment it is grounded in the precedent of the success of the bond funded roosevelt new deal which from 1933 to 1941 reduced unemployment from over a fifth to less than a tenth with an average annual fiscal deficit of only 3 per cent roosevelt s new deal was largely funded through the reconstruction finance corporation rfc a public financial institution set up earlier by president hoover its funding source was the sale of bonds but proceeds from the loans repaid the bonds leaving the rfc with a net profit the rfc financed roads bridges dams post offices universities electrical power mortgages farms and much more and it funded all this while generating income for the government a system of public banks and green qe the us green new deal envisions funding with a combination of the federal reserve a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks which could include banks owned locally by cities and states as sylvia chi chair of the legislative committee of the california public banking alliance explains on medium com the green new deal relies on a network of public banks like a decentralized version of the rfc as part of the plan to help finance the contemplated public investments this approach has worked in germany where public banks have been integral in financing renewable energy installations and energy efficiency retrofits local or regional public banks says chi could help pay for the green new deal by making low interest loans for building and upgrading infrastructure deploying clean energy resources transforming our food and transportation systems to be more sustainable and accessible and other projects the federal government can help by for example capitalizing public banks setting environmental or social responsibility standards for loan programs or tying tax incentives to participating in public bank loans uk professor richard murphy adds another role for the central bank as the issuer of new money in the form of green infrastructure quantitative easing murphy who was a member of the original 2008 uk green new deal group explains all qe works by the buying debt issued by the government or other bodies using money that it quite literally creates out of thin air his money creation process is what happens every time a bank makes a loan all that is unusual is that we are suggesting that the funds created by the using this process be used to buy back debt that is due by the government in one of its many forms meaning that it is effectively canceled the invariable objection to that solution is that it would act as an inflationary force driving up prices but as argued in my earlier article here this need not be the case there is a chronic gap between debt and the money available to repay it that actually needs to be filled with new money every year to avoid a balance sheet recession as uk prof mary mellor formulates the problem in debt or democracy 2016 page 42 a major contradiction of tying money supply to debt is that the creators of the money always want more money back than they have issued debt based money must be continually repaid with interest as money is continually being repaid new debt must be being generated if the money supply is to be maintained this builds a growth dynamic into the money supply that would frustrate the aims of those who seek to achieve a more socially and ecologically sustainable economy in addition to interest says mellor there is the problem that bankers and other rich people generally do not return their profits to local economies unlike public banks which must use their profits for local needs the wealthy hoard their money invest it in the speculative markets hide it in offshore tax havens or send it abroad to avoid the cyclical booms and busts that have routinely devastated the us economy this missing money needs to be replaced and if the new money is used to pay down debt it will be extinguished along with the debt leaving the overall money supply and the inflation rate unchanged if too much money is added to the economy it can always be taxed back but as mmters note we are a long way from the full productive capacity that would overheat the economy today murphy writes of his green qe proposal the qe program that was put in place between 2009 and 2012 had just one central purpose which was to refinance the city of london and its banks what we are suggesting is a smaller programme to kickstart the uk economy by investing in all those things that we would wish our children to inherit whilst creating the opportunities for everyone in every city town village and hamlet in the uk to undertake meaningful and appropriately paid work a network of public banks including a central bank operated as a public utility could similarly fund a us green new deal without raising taxes driving up the federal debt or inflating prices this article was first published under a different title on truthdig com
airbus is considering whether or not to shift the assembly process of its latest generation of a330 planes to china as part of a bid to increase its market share in the world s fastest growing civil aviation market the european multinational is following a trend started by boeing which recently opened a new completion plant in china on the face of it the decision by the two companies which dominate the civilian aviation market makes sense build where your biggest customer lives especially as china does not yet have a fully homegrown civil aviation industry ready to compete globally the benefits are many including the goodwill and esteem of the country that would be buying these planes in the long term however that might prove to be a costly miscalculation based on its recent history here and here it won t take long for china to catch up and largely displace both companies domestically in beijing s home aviation market as well as seizing a large chunk of the corporate duopoly s global market share airbus and boeing could therefore be making short term decisions with negative long term consequences for their future profitability given china s formidable economic advancement none of this should come as a surprise to either airbus or boeing nor should it shock western governments the problem is that everybody has historically been guided by the naïve assumption that simply admitting china to organizations such as the world trade organization wto would induce beijing to in the words of philip pan eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring china into the fold of democratic nations or the chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot china has unquestionably modernized but its politically illiberal dirigiste polity has if anything massively moved in the opposite direction strengthened by that very modernization process that has done anything but falter furthermore the country has many aims and goals that are antithetical to the long term prosperity of western companies and economies as the european union is beginning to recognize boeing and airbus might simply become the latest western sacrificial lambs beijing has explicitly targeted wide bodied aircrafts as one of its 10 new priority sectors for import substitution in its made in china 2025 document so whatever short term gains airbus and boeing receive in terms of securing additional orders from china could well be undermined longer term the resultant technology transfers and lower labor costs will almost certainly give beijing a quantum leap toward competing directly and ultimately displacing both companies given the merger with mcdonnell douglas boeing will continue its march toward effectively becoming a branch of the u s department of defense as its civilian market share crashes but airbus doesn t really have the luxury of a military alternative given the relative paucity of european defense expenditures as if boeing needed any further problems the 737 fiasco represents the latest in a series of setbacks

reliable market signal of an impending recession and rate cutting cycle trump to nominate moore to fed board stephen moore has emerged as an ardent critic of the federal reserve board under its current chairman jerome powell advertisement moody s on outlook for us rates we have altered our subjective odds of the outcomes of the remaining fomc meetings this year we now put the odds of a hike in june at 10 previously 25 while we cut the odds of a rate increase in september to 20 previously 35 our subjective odds of a hike in december are now 30 previously 40 a probabilistic forecasting approach which is based on the subjective probabilities of a fed hike versus a cut would put the fed funds rate at 2 5 at the end of this year implying less than one rate hike our baseline forecast is for two 25 basis point rate hikes but this may need to be adjusted we avoid the elevator forecasting where changes in their interest rate projections rise and fall with each tweak in fed rhetoric therefore any adjustment to the forecast will occur over time commodities copper has worst week since december commerzbank analyst daniel briesemann said copper prices were supported by supply

file photo federal reserve board building on constitution avenue is pictured in washington u s march 19 2019 reuters leah millis file photo by roberta rampton palm beach fla reuters u s president donald trump on friday tapped stephen moore a conservative economic commentator and fellow critic of federal reserve policy under chairman jerome powell to join the u s central bank s board of governors a move that would put a trump loyalist inside the world s most important financial institution moore who last year suggested in a radio interview that trump had cause to fire powell for wrecking our economy would add a critical and unconventional voice to a collegial committee that unanimously backed powell in keeping rate hikes on hold this month the group often reach policy decisions by consensus after debating the issues i will be nominating mr moore to the fed trump told reporters as he arrived in florida for a weekend trip he ll be great on the fed interviewed on bloomberg television on friday after trump s announcement moore said he is an independent voice despite his close ties to and support of trump s policies and said he did not want to be a disruptor but instead aimed to work closely with powell to try to make sure that america grows as fast as it can he described remarks suggesting powell and other fed policymakers should be fired as probably written in a time of anger given a very substantial mistake the fed made in raising rates in december asked if the fed should be cutting interest rates instead he said was unsure one of the things that will be really interesting for me is to hear the case look at their data and then help make the decision about whether we re too tight or too loose moore said before joining the conservative heritage foundation think tank moore had worked as an editorial page writer at the wall street journal he also was an adviser to trump s presidential campaign and holds a master s degree in economics from george mason university i have known steve for a long time and have no doubt he will be an outstanding choice trump wrote on twitter on friday elsewhere on twitter some conservative economists and fellow fed critics were less effusive trust me steve knows absolutely nothing about the federal reserve or monetary policy bruce bartlett a supply side economist who served in the republican administrations of ronald reagan and george h w bush said on twitter stephen moore is unfit to serve on the fed board monetary economist george selgin director of the libertarian cato institute s center for monetary and financial alternatives said on twitter senators mum moore whose nomination would require senate approval helped write trump s signature tax plan the nomination could test just how successful powell has been in his aggressive courting of lawmakers in his first year as fed chair moore will likely face heavy criticism from senate democrats with whom he has clashed for years the biggest question will be whether the republicans who have regularly met with powell agree to advance someone who has publicly chastised the head of the fed and agreed that trump has the power to fire him a spokeswoman for republican senator crapo who leads the senate banking committee whose support is needed before a fed governor can be appointed declined to comment none of the other members of the committee commented when contacted by reuters about moore s nomination the position would give moore a vote at the policy setting table of an institution whose interest rate hikes last year were a frequent target of trump s ire the fed has since put its rate hikes on hold citing slowing global and u s growth and low inflation in the bloomberg television interview moore said he was not sure about whether the fed should cut rates and also said he needed to reserve judgement about the size of the fed s bond holdings because i don t have the full knowledge that i need but he later added that over time obviously we want to reduce that balance sheet and not have these massive amounts of debt on the fed balance sheet the fed on wednesday said it would stop scaling back the vast portfolio of bonds they built up to spur an economic recovery from the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession in current conditions the fed said it needs to have a balance sheet of roughly 3 5 trillion more than four times pre crisis levels to manage interest rates a portfolio that would at some point need to begin slowly growing again over time shifting views trump had actually won broad support for his first fed picks including powell with economists on the left and right seeing them as mainstream choices who could maintain the fed s independence from political concerns and extend a consensus shaped under previous fed chair janet yellen along with powell trump appointed respected academic economist richard clarida as vice chair randal quarles as vice chair for regulation and kansas community banker michelle bowman the choice of moore drew broad criticism as economists across the spectrum noted that moore s writings and comments seemed to confuse basic concepts and had been wildly inconsistent over time trump picked moore after speaking with him to compliment him on an opinion article he co authored in the wall street journal that newspaper reported earlier citing a senior administration official in the article moore argued that the fed s rate hikes promoted deflation and described the central bank as the last major obstacle to the united states staying on a good path while moore has sided with trump in chastising the fed for raising rates he has in the past been just as vocal in critiquing the central bank for not raising them in october 2015 when the unemployment rate was 5 percent versus 3 8 percent today and the fed s preferred measure of inflation was just 1 2 percent lower than today moore wrote in the washington times t he fed refused to raise interest rates off zero in september and hello that easy money policy is how we got into the mess in 2000 and then in 2008 wall street cheered janet yellen s decision to keep the cheap dollars flowing isn t this all starting to sound familiar in the same column he urged congressional republicans to put up a fight on the debt ceiling by requiring more budget discipline as a condition of higher debt levels on friday the treasury department reported a record monthly budget deficit of 234 billion along with using technical terms to mean different things than most economists moore in a 2014 co authored paper argued the exact opposite of the views he embraces today urging the fed to pull liquidity from the economy by selling off its assets because of the risk of inflation the fed may still suffer some losses on these securities sales but the danger of future inflation and political pressure outweigh the consequences of these losses he wrote the u s recovery then was still at a weak point and fed officials at the time felt rates needed to remain low to support employment and growth if confirmed by the senate moore would fill one two open positions on the fed s seven seat board presidents certainly use appointments to shape monetary policy if the senate is willing to go along that is said sarah binder an economics professor at george washington university additional

by yaleglobal online climate change terrorism refugee crises erode the us led world order and china seeks a power balance to address the problems by xueying zhang and yue hans zhu diplomat and historian george f kennan writing as mr x sent an 8 000 word telegram to the state department in 1946 about joseph stalin s aggressive foreign policy warning there would be no permanent peaceful coexistence between the united states and soviet union whose analysis provided an influential underpinning for america s cold war policies on the soviet challenge to the us dominated capitalist and liberal order kennan wrote the main element of any united states policy toward the soviet union must be that of a long term patient but firm and vigilant containment of russian expansive tendencies the soviet union historically one of the most powerful rivals of the united states collapsed decades ago nonetheless as author mark twain reputedly said history often rhymes and threats to the us led liberal international order have not yet been eliminated the current order wrestles with both external interference and internal division on one hand the us leadership faces widening bifurcation between american first policies and keeping to the path of globalization on the other hand a growing china dangles strength with assertive industrial policies and barely disguised ambition to transcend its rival interpreted by some as the harbinger of a new cold war between china and the united states there are many ways to address the question on whether china challenges the current world order from beijing s intentions or its de facto role in the current system many express concern that china is likely to challenge us leadership and incantation of a china threat the title of a book by bill gertz recalls the cold war era minxin pei a political scientist likewise claimed china is undermining the western liberal order in terms of ideological threats meanwhile china once a poor and weak country now sets rules for a number of industries from infrastructure to ai technologies and from trade regulation to international law for example huawei a china based telecommunications equipment company has been a leading actor in the 5g network the answer to this complicated question can be divided into three layers china reshaping itself to engage actively in the current world order rising and gradually asserting its global influence while also contributing innovations the current world order renovated at the end of the cold war has operated for decades under us dominance political democracy and capitalism market economy are the most prominent characteristics with the united states and the european union typically supporting democratic movements and globalization regarded as liberal values that strengthen ties and foster respect for the rule of law both within and among countries free trade the engine of economic growth binds countries together so that war is deemed too costly to wage in retrospect china abandoned its soviet like planned economy model in 1978 starting market oriented reforms and gradually opening the market to private and foreign sectors china partially adjusted its financial institutions and industrial establishment and became a major component of the current order the government ultimately lifted price controls and actively engaged in the global trade system joining the world trade organization in 2001 and becoming a major exporter during the recent waves of anti globalization china portrays herself as a firm advocate of multilateralism and free trade with president xi jinping repeatedly emphasizing that economic globalization is inevitable and irreversible furthermore china is one of five countries with a un security council veto and welcomes development support from international institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund china is now the second largest funder of un peacekeeping forces participating in multiple un programs in 2015 beijing joined with washington in developing new norms for dealing with climate change and cyberspace conflicts china s economic institutions are still complicated distinguished from those in western countries with its conspicuous state intervention in general china so far cannot overthrow or challenge the current world order from which it receives significant benefits rather china adapts secondly a rising china exerts global influence in many areas despite an authoritarian regime china has achieved rapid economic growth gaining stakes to fill the power vacuum caused by wavering us positions according to the atlantic council the united states still maintains a lead in global influence but its share is declining not only in east asia but also outside the region including in nato member states and parts of africa china has surpassed us influence the united states is cutting support to a number of international institutions and agreements for example the trump administration announced us withdrawal from the 2015 paris agreement on climate change denied the value of global cooperation to tackle global warming and abandoned the iran nuclear deal despite an onslaught of criticism the united states left unesco and the un human right council cutting 1 3 billion from the un budget while suspending support for some refugee programs the us played a crucial role in global politics and its absence regardless of reasons will leave many problems unresolved and others in disarray meanwhile china increases its influence on the international stage with financial backing china s un contribution will rise to just over 12 percent for the period 2019 to 2021 granting the country more power in international affairs china s voting rights in the imf have increased and it holds a deputy director position in europe and the united states chinese expansion of overseas investment both in terms of quantity and quality reflects the chinese economy s growing sophistication and desire for greater global influence in particular the fact that chinese foreign direct investment targets cutting edge technologies and the role played by the chinese government in mergers and acquisitions has prompted an urgent response to determine if chinese investments threaten eu security and public order in the united states china also utilizes methods such as co optation and acquisitions to complete corporate transfers many of these technologies such as supercomputing artificial intelligence robotics semiconductors drones hypersonic and 3d printing will help determine the future of global economy chinese and american scholars devote particular attention to analysis of the international order in anticipation of the changes that china s rise might bring with anxiety over redistribution of power the united states defends its international dominance from shrinking and china seeks to strengthen its international influence the so called thucydides trap thirdly with growing economic strength china is gaining confidence to provide innovations to the current order pointing out that maintaining the current system is not enough to cope with emerging challenges for example with globalization trade does not benefit all countries the income gap is growing between developed and developing countries rich and poor south and north chinese leaders repeatedly stress that china remains a powerful supporter of the current order taking action not to replace existing organizations but supplementing them to strengthen that order china is building the asian infrastructure investment bank with more than 65 countries signing on as members the new institution provides funding for china s ambitious belt and road initiative aiming to enhance regional connectivity and prosperity on this basis china has proposed the concept of building a community of human destiny a natural result of interactions between china and the international order china portrays itself as a responsible alternative rejecting trade protectionism and economic nationalism one way or another china s rise challenges the balance of the us led order among the many forces contributing to its deterioration including refugee crises climate change and terrorism the united states does not offer a grand narrative appealing to large majorities domestically much less to other states a new equilibrium is underway and the process will last until the united states and china find a balance on power xueying zhang is a fox fellow at yale university she is pursuing her phd degree in international relations at fudan university china her research interests include east asia economic strategies international institutions and the world order she is also devoted to youth contributions to global affairs and represented china in the g20 youth summit 2017 yue hans zhu is a graduate student at yale economics department whose concentration is public policy and

after the 2003 us led invasion that toppled iraqi leader saddam hussein iran was involved in recycling scrap metal the burned out hulls of saddam s heavy armour headed east including through the bashmaq border crossing in iraqi kurdistan to a factory near isfahan this time the wrecks of vehicles used by the islamic state are being transported for recycling either in erbil or in the mainly shia south with the lucrative trade reportedly organised from mosul by the tehran allied popular mobilisation forces scrap metal is a weighty example of the role of geography in both trade and politics iran and iraq share a 1 458km border their shared history whether peaceful or violent as in the 1980 88 war has always involved business with its economy in recession in the face of us sanctions tehran is oiling the wheels of commerce brian hook the us state department s special representative for iran recently claimed sanctions on oil exports alone had cost tehran 10 billion in revenue since the trump administration tightened the squeeze in november curtailing iraq s trade with iran however represents a serious challenge the principlist media in tehran hailed the march 11 13 visit to iraq by iranian president hassan rohani not so much for his audience with ayatollah ali al sistani iraq s pre eminent shia cleric but for its economic significance if the raft of memorandums of understanding including a railway link between basra and shalamcheh north west of abadan bear fruit they could as officials from both countries suggested boost trade from the current 12 billion to 20 billion annually iran s chamber of commerce has confidently bought an 11 storey building in baghdad the shorter term challenge is how iraq pays given problems using the us dollar a barter system would be of limited use given iran s huge surplus in the trade 75 80 of the 12 billion is iranian exports souks in iraq are adorned with iranian goods including food products household wares and medicines and there is a huge black market in smuggled iranian petrol the world s second cheapest the larger amounts of money lie in energy iran s supplies of electricity and natural gas help make iraq its second biggest export market after china washington s waiver allowing iraq to import iranian gas and electricity runs out this month washington has said the waiver is on the understanding that baghdad take steps towards energy independence given it would take years for iraq to reduce energy dependence it seems likely the waiver will be extended despite its rhetoric to the contrary the us is well aware that iraq cannot abandon iranian gas and electricity suppliers any time soon said hussein dawood visiting fellow at the european council on foreign relations this is especially so given that the iraqi government fears such a move would risk a repeat of the unprecedented protests seen in basra last summer read more iran boosts trade in iraq turkey russia and syria despite us sanctions new border crossing between iran iraq to facilitate trade energy trade is readily monitored by the us treasury which already exerts pressure under the waiver iraq should pay for the electricity 500 megawatts mw in winter 1 200 mw in summer costing annually 1 2 billion in dinars not us dollars also under the waiver iraq is required to hold iran s payments for gas which produce another 1 000 mw of electricity in an escrow account designated for bilateral trade iranian officials have grumbled over iraq s tardiness in paying the rohani visit reportedly encouraged baghdad to hand over 200 million of 2 billion outstanding the two central banks have signed an accord to facilitate payments through non us dollar bank accounts using euros and iraqi dinars to skirt us sanctions but as with the european special purpose vehicle instex this may not escape us pressure nor overcome banks fears of us punishment last may washington sanctioned iraq based al bilad bank for links with iran iraqi president barham salih has advanced a vision of iraq as a regional economic powerhouse in rome in november at the mediterranean dialogues a forum supported by the italian foreign ministry salih spoke of deep port facilities in basra railway networks highway networks airports industrial cities dams irrigation projects in the nineveh plains garmiyan and erbil as well as land reclamations in the south iraq said salih could be an important strategic hub that joins the arab world with iran and turkey and i will say to europe too and connects the economies of the gulf and europe the heart of a new silk road to the mediterranean salih has a long record of friendship with the united states going back to his stint in the 1990s as washington representative of the patriotic union of kurdistan but it is hard to see how such plans can overcome current us iran tensions speaking at an inauguration march 16 at assaluyeh for new phases of the south pars gas field iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh was blunt about future gas exports to baghdad the iraqis are always with us in words
eur usd the federal reserve has left the interest rate unchanged at 2 5 and is no longer going to raise it this year the fed also lowered its forecasts for us gdp and inflation and raised the unemployment forecast for 2019 2021 such actions and statements of the american regulator confirm the start of a recession which should negatively affect the us currency as a result the dollar fell to the mark of 1 1447 for 1 euro on thursday march 20 but then instead of continuing to decline it recovered in relation to almost all major currencies and above all in relation to the euro this happened due to disappointing data from germany pmi business activity index in the manufacturing sector in february was only 44 7 instead of the expected value of 48 0 this news caused concern about the global economic crisis once again and led not only to a depreciation of the euro but also to a sharp drop in stocks and bonds the pair eur usd lost 175 points in two days and then after a small rebound completed the week at 1 1300 gbp usd the brexit final stage is delayed the pitiable finale for the pound is delayed as well the british currency lost about 300 points in the first four days of the week coming close to the level of 1 3000 however the pigeon rhetoric of the us federal reserve head jerome powell and the help from the eu which gave prime minister teresa may time until april 12 to resolve the issue of accepting her deal allowed the pound to move a little away from the brink of abyss and finish the five day close to a strong support resistance level 1 3200 usd jpy unlike its european colleagues the past week was successful for the yen against the backdrop of expectations of a recession a revision of macroeconomic forecasts and a fall in the value of stocks and bonds in the united states and europe the pair dropped to 109 70 by mid friday march 22 and the final chord sounded at 109 90 cryptocurrencies all sorts of gurus continue to hypnotize the public with predictions of an upcoming rise of digital currencies so famous american venture investor tim draper believes that the massive transition to cryptocurrency will begin in about two years time and tom lee a financial analyst and co founder of fundstrat global advisors has given a shorter term forecast having said in an interview to cnbc that the bearish sentiment on the bitcoin market will be replaced by the bullish one within six months the turning point in his opinion will be in august and the btc rate can easily reach 10 20 000 in contrast to this yet virtual optimism quite real pessimistic notes are heard for example the chicago board options exchange cboe which once launched bitcoin futures trading has now refused to add new contracts on such a news background as we predicted the btc usd did not manage to break above the 4 150 horizon the only hope for investors can be the fact that the pair did not fall below 4 000 for almost the entire week which allows us to go on talking about an uptrend albeit a weak one also the litecoin ltc usd has not left the limits of the ascending channel the ethereum eth usd is consolidating near the 139 00 horizon and for the ripple xrp usd a 10 week pivot point can be considered the level of 0 318 as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd the situation with this pair can be described as a complete uncertainty on the one hand the slowdown in us gdp on the other disappointment with the prospects for the german economy the fed s refusal to raise the interest rate is playing against the dollar and the endless uncertainty with the uk leaving the eu is playing against the euro the yield on 10 year us treasury bonds touched more than a year s bottom but the yield on 10 year german bonds is on the verge of falling below 0 us futures s p 500 fell by 0 5 and european stocks are in the red approaching as for the main indexes to a loss of 1 this swing can be swung indefinitely that is why the votes of experts this week have been evenly divided 50 to 50 it should be noted that in the transition to the medium term forecast 70 of analysts are already on the side of bulls the graphical analysis on h4 draws first the rise to the level of 1 1380 for the coming days then the fall to the level of 1 1175 after which the pair should return to the limits of the medium term corridor 1 1215 1 1570 as for the events of the coming week we can note the speech of the ecb head mario draghi on wednesday march 27 as well as the publication of the german consumer price index and annual data on us gdp on thursday march 28 moreover according to the forecast the real value of gdp may be 0 2 lower than the previous one gbp usd prime minister theresa may asked the european union to delay the exit of britain from the eu until june 30 2019 however the eu has already said that the delay should be longer otherwise there should be no delay at all the transfer of brexit for such a short time is a very undesirable option as it simply prolongs the ambiguity of which everyone is already rather tired and which constantly puts pressure on the pound at the moment most experts 60 believe that the pair should test the level of 1 3000 again and in case of its breakdown reach the bottom at the level of march 11 low 1 2955 an alternative point of view will be realized at the release of positive news regarding brexit in which case the pair can rise to the height of 1 3310 the following resistance levels are 1 3350 and 1 3 445 usd jpy the overwhelming majority of both trend indicators and oscillators on h4 and d1 are colored red however already 15 of oscillators on both timeframes signal that the pair is oversold the graphical analysis on d1 speaks about a possible reversal of the trend to the north according to its readings the pair can return to the zone 110 75 112 15 the opinions of the experts are divided as follows 50 have voted for the pair to fall further 30 are for its upward reversal and 20 are for its lateral movement the formation of trends as this have been happening recently will be influenced by news regarding the course of the us china negotiations and macroeconomic indicators from europe and the usa supporting or refuting the possibility of a new global economic crisis cryptocurrencies the total capitalization of the crypto market has slowly grown to the value of last november checking out on wednesday march 20 at the height of 141 6 billion it is possible that this is why for the first time in a long time 70 of the experts have not given gloomy forecasts and limited to moderate optimism in their opinion the btc usd pair will not fall below 3 900 next week but will try to overcome the resistance of 4 200 however in the transition to the medium term forecast the balance of powers changes and here as before 70 of analysts side with the bears voting for the decline of the pair in spring below 3 000
via caseyresearch com zerohedge com sat 03 23 2019 it s totally incorrect week here at casey research we ve shared doug casey s uncensored insights on topics ranging from the climate change hoax to the next 9 11 type event but today s essay may be the most controversial one yet doug says a disaster of historic proportions is on the menu for 2019 and it s critical to understand what s happening read on for four specific predictions about what lies ahead some of these predictions may seem outlandish but you owe it to yourself to hear what he has to say prediction 1 the end of retirement the average american can forget about retirement we ve all heard these stories about how the average american couldn t lay his hands on 1 000 to save his life his expenses aren t going away however even if his income does it seems like things have reached a critical mass and if the economy slows down there are going to be a lot of people losing their homes again they ll be unable to pay their credit card bills their car payments their student loans or anything else they aren t going to be able to buy anything they wound up in breadlines in the 30s but today 40 million americans have snap cards to take away the hunger pains and embarrassment of being penniless there could be 100 million in a few years i know this sounds outrageous because right now everything is running fairly smoothly the standard of living of the average middle class american has degraded slowly over decades but hasn t yet totally collapsed but that s the way it is a day before a volcano explodes or a day before an earthquake or minutes before an avalanche starts coming down this isn t a theoretical discussion most retirement plans are in serious jeopardy many pension funds are already seriously underwater even after a very long boom the situation is likely to deteriorate the stock market is in a bubble the bond market is in a hyper bubble a lot of value could disappear very quickly by the time this depression bottoms in today s dollars i don t know what the dollars are going to be worth the dow could trade at 5 000 or less we re going to see interest rates exceed what we saw in the early 1980s when the u s government was paying 15 from a retiree s point of view things are not going to improve it s going to get worse not better his savings if he has any are going to be attacked from several angles i don t see any way out of this unless friendly aliens land on the roof of the white house and present trump with some kind of magic technology prediction 2 a white male privilege tax and other radical tax hikes you ve got to remember that the prime directive of any organism whether it s an amoeba a person a corporation or a government is to survive bankrupt governments and they re all bankrupt because of welfare state policies are going to fight to survive the only way that they can survive is to tax more and print more money and that s exactly what they re going to do of course don t discount a war these fools actually believe that would stimulate the economy the way only turning lots of cities into smoking ruins can i suspect they ll try to make white males bear most of the burden that s partly because they still have most of the money and partly because it s become fashionable to hate white males in particular it s natural to want to hurt people that they think are the problem what marxists would say are the class enemy we re going to see much higher taxes among other unsavory things there s no other way to pay for welfare state programs except sell more debt to the fed which they ll also do by necessity inflation will get out of control as a result of course you ve got to remember that as recently as the eisenhower administration the top marginal tax rate was theoretically 91 the average person didn t pay anywhere remotely near that because it was a steeply progressive tax rate nobody did frankly especially the rich because there were loads of tax shelters which no longer exist hiding money offshore among other things was easy now these things are out of the question now there s no place to hide from the state and envy is rampant how bad could it get in sweden during the 1970s the marginal tax rate including their wealth tax was something like 102 so almost anything is possible of course they ll raise taxes radically it s time to eat the rich prediction 3 like venezuela socialism will conquer the u s its ideas already have first we should define what socialism is it s state ownership of the means of production it was supposed to be a passing stage on the road to communism communism is communal ownership of private goods houses cars shops and consumer items as well as capital goods nobody even talks about that anymore since capitalism has given most people so much stuff that they don t even have room to store it all socialism in the u s is unlikely governments have found it s much more efficient to simply have the state control capital as opposed to owning and operating it it s so much easier to just take as much as they want of the profits then blame the capitalists if something goes wrong with delivery of the goods forgetting about north korea and cuba there are no socialist states anywhere in the world what we have instead are welfare states where the government provides some degree of free schooling free medical care free housing free food and so forth if not free then subsidized the next step is a guaranteed annual income the word socialism today is actually just shorthand for a welfare state which is what boobus americanus the hoi polloi really want they don t really care who owns the factories the fields and the mines what they care about is that somebody gives them a soft life when you give people the ability to vote themselves free stuff at somebody else s expense they ll do it but much worse they now actually think it s the right thing to do why mainly because of the propaganda that they ve absorbed through college and the media the entertainment world and numerous other places there s no question about the fact that the u s will turn into a full fledged welfare state socialism is basically about the forceful control of other people s lives and property it isn t just an intellectual failing it s actually a moral failing although perversely it s sold as being moral people buy it because they like to believe they re doing the right thing it will end with an economic collapse then a political and most importantly a cultural collapse prediction 4 a new 9 11 type event real or a contrived false flag it s entirely possible it s still completely undetermined what actually happened on 9 11 and who was actually behind it notwithstanding that considering how the u s government continues to provoke people all over the world there s certainly some group most likely mohammedans who ll decide to strike out against the great satan and as 9 11 showed regardless of who was actually responsible a very small number of people can have a very large effect on things especially when the system itself is critically unstable which it is today they might do something like mumbai in 2008 it took only two dozen fanatics with ordinary guns they turned the whole city totally on its head for days that was extremely cheap low tech and easy warfare has always been a matter of economics cheap trumps expensive there are scores of ways to severely disrupt an advanced society for a trivial investment on the other hand it s extremely expensive to disrupt a primitive society as the u s is discovering in afghanistan anyway terrorism is an extremely low cost method of warfare it will have a gigantic effect when someone decides to use it in the u s 9 11 was just an amuse bouche you can plan your life around something like that happening again the world is evolving at the rate of moore s law in many regards let me emphasize that military technology is changing too aircraft carriers b2s f35s m1 tanks and so forth are basically junk great for fighting the soviet union which no longer exists they serve no useful purpose in the kind of battles that are likely in the future if someone wants to attack the u s they re not going to use an icbm they re extremely expensive clunky and you can see where they come from guaranteeing retaliation it s total idiocy that even a maniac wouldn t bother with not when you can deliver a backpack nuke by fedex cheap and on time or you could use any commercial aircraft container ship or truck if you want to blame iran and really whip up the u s population there would be nothing like a small nuclear or radiological attack to do it it s a pity since they re a distant regional power with a failing economy who present about zero threat to the u s if i were to attempt putting my finger on exactly when the u s will go over the edge i would think the real catalyst might be the next 9 11 type event i don t doubt it s going to happen how are we any different than the germans in the 1920s they were one of the most civilized best educated countries in europe and they fell into the abyss
we have been saying for some time now that we are living in a vuca environment categorized by volatility uncertainty chaos and ambiguity the past is most probably not an indicator of the change to come it is unpredictable nothing showed it more than the market reaction on friday when the yield curve inverted stoking fears of an upcoming recession stock markets fell as bond yields plummeted while inverted yield curves have been precursors of recessions many times in the past we do not think that indicator will be reliable this time at least not for the united states let us restate that we remain concerned about the economic environment in europe and to a lesser degree japan but not the prospects for continued growth in the united states and china in fact we believe that the economies of the united states and china are bottoming out such that growth will accelerate for the remainder of 2019 into 2020 especially if trade deals are reached which are highly probable the slowdown in europe and japan won t really impact the current outlook in the u s and china all that much one of the conclusions of last week s blog was that the u s and china will be the engines of future global growth which is a necessity if growth is to improve in the eurozone japan and also the emerging markets where would you rather invest clearly europe is falling behind competitively and desperately needs trade financial tax and regulatory reforms however we do not see how the eu can effectively negotiate trade deals and set financial tax regulatory reforms that serves each member self interests why do you think brexit is occurring in the first place just look at the internal debates in france greece italy and spain as other examples at the heart of the eurozone s problems there is a battle in europe between the have and have not nations and it won t end soon unless germany relents especially now and let countries increase spending cut taxes and increase deficits to boost their local economies ironically germany has its own problems as exemplified by its march pmi which fell to 44 7 due to sharp declines in new orders lower work backlogs and firings the manufacturing pmi fell to a low not seen since the financial crisis the all important german car market is being hurt by weakening exports clearly impacted by global trade conflicts the french pmi was no better falling to 48 7 in march with the manufacturers pmi below 50 too penalized especially by weakness in exports japan has somewhat better prospects than europe as the government fully recognizes the problems and is doing all that it can to bolster growth but is constrained by its huge total debt to gnp broad weakness is evident by the march pmi remaining below 50 with real weakness in orders especially for exports while we expect the government to postpone a hike in the retail tax rate in the fall that won t do anything to stimulate growth japan is in a box badly needing the end of trade conflicts no surprise therefore that 10 year german and japanese bond yields are hovering around zero having dropped beneath that barrier on friday understand that there is not much more that the ecb and boj can do to stimulate growth at this point as monetary policies are as easy as they can be so there needs to be either major financial tax and regulatory reforms or trade deals to rescue their economies our financial markets reacted according to script on friday looking in their rear view mirror when 10 year u s treasury bond yields fell beneath the 2 year treasury bond if you were a foreign investor wouldn t you be buying our debt with both hands pushing our yields down but still well above their levels inversion has been a reliable precursor to a recession but we do not think so this time here is why first of all the fed has made a complete about turn since october becoming more concerned about an economic slowdown than virtually anything else the only surprise to us in last week s fed decision was that the fed expects to raise rates maybe only once in 2020 that s right 2020 we had expected the fed to be on hold hiking the funds rate for the rest of the year and for the portfolio runoff to end in 4 months or so we were not far off the mark even though the fed may not have reached their upside target funds rate the current rate is high enough such that they can reduce rates just as much as they raised them if needed to bolster our economy europe and japan cannot say that there are tremendous benefits to our economy as rates go down beginning with business and consumer debt refinancing at lower interest rates therefore reducing annual costs boosting income if we were so worried that higher rates would choke off the economy then why don t we think that lower rates could boost growth it will yes savers may earn less on their balances but only if when the fed lowers the funds rate housing an interest sensitive sector of our economy has already begun to strengthen and we expect a strong spring selling season second the u s economy has added over 2 million jobs over the last year at higher hourly wage rates and there are over 7 million job opening waiting to be filled we are confident that consumer spending which is over 63 of our gnp will remain strong third the u s will continue to benefit from trump s tax reform program enacted over a year ago while we question whether the total package was fiscally responsible due to the large upfront deficits it is without a doubt highly stimulative for the next few years and we expect corporations to boost capital spending especially for technology due to the immediate write off which will lead to higher productivity gains in future years a huge plus for holding down future inflation while boosting profits finally there is regulatory relief which will continue to boost growth over the foreseeable future we are therefore confident that the u s economy will continue to perform above average for the remainder of the year and may even do better once if trade deals are reached we recognize that our trade balance will remain a drag on reported gnp but the primary reason is our domestic strength and weakness overseas we continue to believe that the u s economy will expand by over 2 4 in 2019 with the first quarter being the weakest next year could be even better once if trade deals are reached we also expect trump do everything in his power to boost the economy prior to the presidential election the other engine of global growth remains china china is truly the economic wonder of the world sustaining growth well over 6 for a decade just the law of compounding should reduce its growth rate to around 6 in 2019 what country wouldn t want that the chinese government reacted swiftly to slowing growth over the last six months but reducing financial capital ratios flooding the system with liquidity major infrastructure programs and sharp reductions in taxes for both businesses and individuals we remain confident that china s economy will accelerate for the rest of the year and will do even better if when trade deals are reached the bottom line is that the two engines of global growth are doing quite well thank you so fears of any imminent downturn let alone a recession in the u s due to the recent inverted yield curve are greatly exaggerated the yield curve inverted due to explosive demand for our debt from abroad where rates are nonexistent past experiences from an inverted yield will not be prologue for the future in our opinion stay the course our portfolios are comprised of great companies selling below intrinsic value we own drug companies benefitting from new product introductions rising margins and above average yields capital goods and industrials growing 1 5x gnp with rising margins generating huge free cash flow technology at a fair price to growth including semis with rising margins and huge free cash flow cable companies with content generating huge cash flow low cost industrial commodity companies generating huge free cash flow with well above market yields housing related companies benefitting from lower interest rates and many special situations where internal developments will close the gap between current prices and intrinsic value our portfolio sells at a multiple below the average of the s p despite higher growth rates and a dividend yield above the 10 year treasury we remain flat the dollar and own no bonds remember to review all of the facts pause reflect and consider mindset shifts

associated press in a letter published by the times of london on march 30 1981 364 highly prominent economists predicted that margaret thatcher s fiscal policies would lead england to disaster to say that groupthink dominates an economics profession that seems to go out of its way to be spectacularly wrong brings new meaning to understatement figure that economists similarly mocked ronald reagan s economic policy mix the view in the 1970s was that pushing the top rate of taxation below 70 would cause an inflationary breakout somehow government having more money wasn t inflationary but leaving it in the hands of those who first produced the wealth would be according to the deep thinkers who gave us the malaise decade economists who favored reduced rates of taxation as those advising reagan did were very much on the outside looking in what about money created long ago by producers of real goods and services who sought a common agreement about value that would enable producers to exchange with one another despite their varied wants these individuals gradually happened on gold as the most stable commodity to define money with gold didn t emerge by accident or thanks to sun spots but because money is only money when its value is viewed as credible not according to modern economists whose income is an effect of the productive class they look on gold defined money with disdain in the way that a resident of a nice neighborhood would turn his nose up to a neighbor prone to parking the car on the front lawn economists prefer money without anchor given their near consensus belief that devalued currencies spark economic booms undefined money frees those advised by economists to shrink the value of the money we all earn all the while taxing the investment investors are buying future currency income streams without which there is no growth economists cheer these policies and oddly do so the most when they re most harmful during periods of economic weakness in his 21st century case for gold george gilder referenced a bipartisan panel of economists polled by the university of chicago in 2012 to reveal that 43 percent of those queried disagreed with the gold standard while 57 percent strongly disagreed all of this came to mind while reading about alleged bias in the economics profession toward women responding to an american economic association aea survey in which according to the washington post an alarmingly high number of women said they felt discrimination and an overall feeling of not being welcomed by their fellow phds walking talking economic fallacy ben bernanke shook his proverbial fist in dismay telling post reporter heather long that he found the results very distressing janet yellen seconded bernanke s worry telling the post that there is a significant problem that requires being addressed forcefully oh dear can they really be so blind talk about missing the forest for the rather small trees economists for being economists are supposed to intimately understand the value of being different and in ways that might invite discrimination for economists to be like everyone else would lead not so much to discrimination but to potentially being lost in the pack to differentiate oneself in the marketplace to essentially invite discrimination is for an individual to ultimately set herself up for market gain wait a second some might respond the females surveyed weren t talking about discrimination based on ideology or style but discrimination related to them being women ok but yellen rose to the highest of economic heights in being appointed federal reserve chairman the fed an employer of more economists than any other entity christina romer headed up the council of economic advisors cea under barack obama christine lagarde presently heads up the international monetary fund laura d andrea tyson headed up the cea under bill clinton alice rivlin was vice chair at the fed carmen reinhart s this time is different is one of the more quoted modern economics books judy shelton is regularly mentioned as an eventual trump appointee to the fed the prominence of female economists seems to indicate that they re not discriminated against that the clubbiest of economic clubs are very much populated by them assuming the profession s leading lights could in the words of yellen address alleged discrimination forcefully it s apparent they would pry open the door only to find lots of females already in the club and in senior positions after that the distress expressed by bernanke and yellen at least on its face speaks to why females shouldn t care about being wooed by the economics club in the first place it s plainly divorced from on the ground economic realities while economists laughably purport to measure economic activity through frequently backwards calculations like gdp and conduct all manner of expensively opaque studies about people and processes don t they know that the greatest drivers of economic growth are among the most discriminated against people the world has ever known lest bernanke et al forget entrepreneurs are individuals who believe something deeply in the face of deep skepticism from the opinion shapers and financiers possessing the means to support them rest assured that jeff bezos and amazon were long ago a laugh line so was espn so were the wright brothers so was thomas edison the list is long despite this the very individuals who power the economic growth economists claim to be measuring entrepreneurs soldier on they continue to look for financial support in the face of endless closed doors and ridicule can bernanke yellen and other aea types presently up in arms about supposedly discriminated against female economists really be so blind to actual economic reality just about anyone with a good economy boosting idea suffers a level of discrimination and ridicule that would make what female economists endure seem highly trivial by comparison if we assume anti female discrimination exists discrimination that the prominence of yellen and others belies those discriminated against are gaining real world insights and presumably fuel in a profession largely defined by a lack of same indeed we re talking about a profession that is almost monolithic in its belief that greater government control over the economy through government spending stimulates growth that too many people working and producing ultimately suffocates growth through higher inflation you can t make this up that economic progress would halt absent the fiddling of central bankers and worst of all economists are near unanimous in their criminally obtuse belief that the wealth destruction maiming and killing that was world war ii ended the great depression back to those who feel discriminated against welcome to the truth about life meaning economics that you aim to help others understand economic advance is almost as a rule powered by those operating on the outside and for those in economics who don t feel discriminated against you probably don t because you re part of the groupthink contra bernanke and yellen there s too little discrimination in the economics profession precisely because economists agree on so much and that s why it s such a stagnant bereft of originality waste of humanity
earlier this year apple ceo tim cook published a letter to apple investors warning that the greater than expected economic deceleration in china would lead to end of year revenue shortfalls apple s letter introduced the rest of the world to a situation that had been unfolding in china s domestic economy since the middle of 2018 broad economic weakness across private industries and consumers driven by a domestic financial crackdown and ongoing u s china trade tensions over the past decade each period of chinese economic weakness has been marked by a government led stimulus program that has buoyed the domestic economy and international markets as infrastructure and real estate investment sucked up commodities from the rest of the world and households wealthy from rapidly rising housing prices and urban incomes have driven growing sales in global luxury brands from apple to bmw mosads as a result news of a chinese slowdown triggered expectations of subsequent stimulus and therefore a boost to global markets but officials are still dealing with the hangovers from 2009 and 2015 the past two periods of government intervention according to the bank for international settlements china s debt to gdp ratio at the end of 2008 was a reasonable 142 percent by the beginning of 2016 it had jumped to 244 percent an increase of more than 100 percentage points in less than a decade this rate of credit expansion has no clear precedents in modern history it also led to dangerous excesses local governments invested in vanity projects in addition to necessary infrastructure investments easy credit drove a real estate bubble that attracted household and corporate speculators even china s state owned enterprises played a role investing in new housing developments rather than focusing on their less profitable core industries speculation drove risks as investors hid their transactions away from regulators oversight china s president xi jinping can no longer rely on the same tools to dig the economy out of this slowdown however excessive debt and financial risk issues aside policymakers in beijing do not want to rely on these tools credit fueled infrastructure and real estate investment even when focused on productive investments no longer make sense for the chinese economy as china s economy reduces its reliance on heavy industry and instead becomes more services focused traditional methods of stimulus would drive resources away from the industries that the country is developing to guide the next 20 years of economic growth such as semiconductors electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing that is not to say that beijing will simply let the economy land where it may but this intervention will be both smaller and targeted differently than past eras beijing is allowing local governments to issue bonds to support infrastructure projects but not enough to accelerate growth the central bank is increasing liquidity for banks but forcing them to drive loans to the private sector a less profitable and more unstable client than state owned enterprises maintaining momentum while preventing the economy from going off the side of the road is the main goal the second key tool is clearing out roadblocks for private sector activity and investment with enough credit in the system economic activity could power through regulatory uncertainty even as it accumulated damage from the inefficiencies and negative spillovers but with less credit in the system companies need a clearer path to invest the result has been a loosening of burdens a recent government meeting announced a cut to businesses value added tax as well as a reduction on social security contributions by corporations other marginal adjustments have eased licensing requirements making bond issuance safer for banks and cheaper for corporations mossecondads the goal is to free up private sector cash so companies have the capacity to make their own investment decisions tax and regulatory cuts do not directly raise debt to gdp levels and moving investment decisions from governments to the private sector should increase the return on investment of stimulus efforts consumers will also enjoy continued subsidies on purchases of electric vehicles a policy that supports a growing domestic industry and the ever more important urban consumers if this all sounds familiar it should china s stimulus is slowly becoming more similar to the united states and other developed economies reflecting the fact that china itself is an increasingly middle class society with an economy led by services and consumption the united states should benefit from this shift u s firms tend to export more services and consumer items to china than the commodities and capital equipment that have benefited from past stimulus booms of course settling the trade war will be critical to maximizing these benefits but this mix and match approach a few percentage points here a few there will not support either the domestic or international economy as quickly as before and the channels will be different as well commodities exporters will not see the same boost as in previous periods countries that have relied on exporting their manufactured products to china germany japan and south korea among others will not see a boost to their orders countries and firms waiting with bated breath for china to ride to the rescue will have to wait a little longer if it comes at all and the global economy may be left with dwindling chinese demand and without a backup plan andrew coflan is an analyst

greyerz the most important chart of this century and what will take the world by surprise as the world edges closer to the next crisis today the man who has become legendary for his predictions on qe and historic moves in currencies shared with king world news the most important chart of this century and what will take the world by surprise central banks continue to menace the world march 24 king world news egon von greyerz the astonishing fed again proved the consistency of its inconsistency since its creation in 1913 the fed has always been behind the curve it is hard to believe that this is just incompetence but the recent change of policy hardly seems to be part of a plan looking back at the fed s policy decisions it is clear that decisions are reactive rather than proactive central banks have been totally detrimental to the world economy they serve no constructive purpose whatsoever as a matter of fact they are a menace to the world and actually make things a lot worse than they would be if the laws of nature would rule the natural rhythm of ebb and flow would regulate markets effortlessly without the need for artificial interference by central banks if demand for credit is too high the law of supply and demand would restrict the supply by interest rates going up and if there was no demand for credit loans would be cheap with rates going down instead what we have now is manipulated rates at zero or negative and more debt outstanding than ever in history that breaks all laws of nature and can only happen through false markets this has led to global debt tripling in this century no wonder we have massive bubbles in stocks bonds and property together with debt that will never be repaid the chart below shows the fed rate for 65 years just looking at recent history the revered alan greenspan raised rates in late 1987 then crashed rates from 10 in 1989 to 3 in 1992 thereafter the fed funds rate gradually increased to 6 5 in july of 2000 when the nasdaq crash started a crash of 80 in the nasdaq forced a reactive fed to reduce rates to 1 in late 2003 stocks stabilized and rates were raised to 5 by september of 2006 then came the subprime disaster and the reactive fed slashed rates to virtually zero by december of 2008 rates stayed at that level until december of 2015 seven years of zero interest rates did wonders for the stock market and also gave the illusion of a growing economy the red arrows in the graphs clearly show fed decisions were caused by a panic reaction to unforeseen events at none of these periods did the fed forecast the latent disaster clearly none of their models work nor do they see that rather than solving problems they are the cause of the problem obviously economies will grow in nominal terms if central banks around the world print trillions of dollars euros yen renminbi etc and at the same time set interest rates at zero or negative the only problem is that more and more money needs to be printed for economies to simply remain stagnant because if you could create wealth by printing money why would anyone need to work as the us economy deteriorates rates are more likely to go down than up eventually there will be full blown qe of a magnitude that will dwarf the 2007 9 money printing but i don t expect rates to stay low for very long first the dollar will fall precipitously then international credit markets will panic and start selling us treasuries china and japan have more than 1 trillion each of us debt and they will dump it as fast as they can this will start a vicious cycle of falling bond markets higher rates and a crashing dollar central banks will then totally lose control of rates as the long end of the market pulls the shorter rates higher as the money printing intensifies inflation will surge putting further upward pressure on rates at some point in the next few years rates will at least reach the 1980 81 level of 20 with hyperinflation and defaults rates could go even higher a 21 mortgage and unlimited money printing this is of course nothing new in history i remember when i lived in the uk in the 1970s how rates and inflation were in the mid to high teens for several years for a while i paid 21 interest on my first mortgage in the uk how many people could afford that today very few nor could any country service its debts even with rates going up just a couple of percent with the much higher rates that i am forecasting debts can only be serviced through unlimited money printing of worthless fiat money this will further put pressure on the dollar and other currencies and accelerate the decline to their intrinsic value of zero this is not a scenario that many people could believe today but as we know optimism is at a peak just before markets turn we could be at that point now my preferred scenario has always been that markets topped in the autumn of 2018 most european and asian markets are well below their peaks the us market has attempted to make new highs but so far failed when a market is in a perma bull mode all news is good news higher rates mean a strong economy so the market goes up lower rates stimulate the economy so the market goes up but in spite of continued uber optimism the dow has so far not managed to break the highs and why should it when earnings forecasts are looking grim and the economy is turning down i regularly meet and give talks to family offices and other ultra high net worth individuals even today there is virtually no fear among these groups that the trend in markets will reverse nobody sees any risk in the bubble asset markets such as stocks and bonds many of them are all like alfred born at the end of wwii successful in their professional life and have made big profits on stocks by permanently being long the market the fact that trees don t grow to the sky hasn t entered their mind if you can make a fortune from investing over a 50 year adult life why wouldn t it continue very few can fathom that they have been living in an era fueled by credit expansion and money printing which has artificially propelled asset markets ever higher snap back will take the world by surprise but if it has lasted 50 years why can t it continue another 10 years or more in theory this is possible but we are no longer just talking about one market or just the west no this rubber band has been over stretched all around the world from australia in the south to norway in the north and from china in the east to california in the west the snap back will come out of the blue and take the world by total surprise after a short hyperinflationary money printing period global assets and debts will implode and we will see a fall in global wealth of at least 200 trillion in today s money and much more in hyperinflationary money in coming years the world will experience the biggest wealth destruction in history and it will come as a total shock to 99 5 to investors for the 0 5 who are prepared for this it will be the opportunity of the century it will be the biggest short the spectacular long the short is obviously asset markets such as stocks property and bonds and the long is precious metals like gold and silver but this trade won t work like it did in the 2006 9 crisis this time financial markets are unlikely to perform and counterparties will fail therefore buying financial futures contracts or derivatives will serve no purpose since no one will be in a position to cash in so this short and long will have to be played differently this time the short side means getting out of all the bubble assets and having a minimal exposure to stocks bonds etc and the long side doesn t mean buying etfs or futures instead investors most own physical assets like gold and silver and store them outside the financial system the most important chart of this century the graph below shows what it will look like it is the 200 year dow gold ratio the price of the dow divided by the gold price this ratio crashed to 1 to 1 in 1980 this means that the prices of the dow and gold were the same at 850 as stocks rose and gold came down the ratio peaked at 45 in 1999 it then fell by 87 to 5 in 2011 as stocks crashed and gold surged since then we have seen a correction up in the ratio but the dow is still down 57 against gold in this century and now the ratio is ready for the resumption of the downtrend which is likely to overshot the 1999 level at 1 instead it will reach 0 5 or much lower this means that the dow will fall at least 98 vs gold from today s level 10 000 50 000 gold so the choice is simple hold on to stocks and see them decline by at least 90 like 1929 32 alternatively investors who sell their stocks and buy gold will instead of losing most of their wealth benefit from gold going up to levels which are unimaginable today that could be 10 000 or 50 000 even in today s money add many zeros to that when we get hyperinflation similar moves could be expected in both bonds and property vs gold as credit markets crash and rates surge there will be major defaults including sovereign defaults most major nations won t officially default because they will instead introduce a 10 100 year moratoria which in effect is another way of defaulting in addition the dollar and other currencies will be debased to virtually zero making most bonds worthless the same thing will happen with property markets bricks and mortar have no value if the property doesn t return a yield in the form of rent a very high percentage of tenants will be unable to pay rent or service their debts leading to major defaults in real estate lending and a crash in property prices so investors who get out of stocks today and buy gold will not only save themselves from ruin but also make a considerable fortune in gold but sadly less than 1 of investors will be prepared for this and therefore will experience a total destruction of their wealth built up over a lifetime for those who

china s new silk road may hurt italian workers analysts say by jamie dettmer march 23 2019 italian prime minister giuseppe conte signed up his country saturday to china s belt and road initiative bri an ambitious trillion dollar transcontinental trade and infrastructure project the memorandum signing in rome was the centerpiece of chinese president xi jinping s three stop visit to europe and it will make italy the first g 7 nation to participate in china s so called new silk road italy s endorsement of the bri which spans eurasia as well as the middle east and parts of africa has prompted the disquiet not only of the united states but also of european union leaders who have voiced concern about beijing s growing political clout in europe and its use of commerce as a tool of statecraft the u s has been critical of the trillion dollar project and warned about the risks of debt trap diplomacy members of the eu are worried the plan could add to fissures in an already strained coalition they aren t alone in worrying about what the longer term consequences on italy might be if signing up for bri moves from symbolism into full participation matteo salvini head of the populist lega party which represents one half of italy s coalition government is indicating his opposition by staying away from the signing ceremony and won t be present at a scheduled gala dinner afterward salvini an ideological bedfellow of donald trump and friend of the u s president s former adviser steve bannon frets the bri risks turning italy into a chinese colony and will saddle it with more debt he also has publicly indicated his security concerns about allowing the chinese control of critical infrastructure including major ports before allowing someone to invest in the ports of trieste or genoa i would think about it not once but a hundred times salvini said earlier this month some italian officials in the economy and finance ministry have also offered behind the scenes warnings they argue that while engaging with beijing in this manner may help boost italian exports to china a prospect highlighted by xi in marketing bri it will likely result in a bigger boost for cheap chinese exports to italy such a scenario they caution could have a ruinous impact on domestic italian producers and workers if trade does take off significantly it might be a matter of short term gain but long term pain one official told voa despite the warnings as well as u s and eu disapproval of italy s bri endorsement conte and luigi di maio leader of the anti establishment five star movement which makes up half of the country s populist coalition government says chinese investment could kick start italy s sputtering economy several of the eu s smaller cash strapped nations have also signed up in the past two years to china s bri hoping that by doing so their economies will be boosted italy slipped into recession last year and its debt levels are among the highest in europe the populist coalition government came to power in june 2018 with high spending plans promising expensive pension reforms and a living wage for all italians italian ministers favoring bri accuse other large eu countries including france which is critical of the bri of hypocrisy saying they conduct multi million dollar deals anyway with china albeit outside the framework of the new silk road initiative the way we see it it is an opportunity for our companies to take the opportunity of china s growing importance in the world italy s under secretary of state for trade and investment michele geraci told foreign reporters but some italian officials worry that view might be short sighted they say while the bri may offer italy new funding sources the country is still lagging well behind the foreign investment levels it enjoyed before the 2008 global financial crash it could trigger a significant wave of chinese imports which would have long term detrimental consequences for italian industry employment and politics the officials in the country s finance ministry who declined to be identified for this article have been scrutinizing recent academic studies on the impact of chinese imports on local labor markets a series of studies including those by economists david autor david dorn and gordon hanson suggests that western countries and regions exposed to rising chinese import competition see a major jump in unemployment lower labor force participation and lower wages unskilled and manual workers are especially adversely affected the impacts are most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow with wages and labor force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the china trade shock commences exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income noted autor dorn and hanson in a paper for the national bureau of economic research an influential u s based nonprofit other recent academic studies have noted that the regions of the u s and europe most impacted by trade with china are the ones which in recent elections and plebiscites have backed populist candidates and nationalist causes like brexit support fueled by anger at the effects of globalization brexit is britain s decision to leave the european union ironically looking to beijing for an economic boost and to alleviate economic deprivation could well hurt the workers and businesses who backed populists in the first place and who the populists want to help salvini gets that but the rest of the coalition doesn t observed an italian official news letter join the globalsecurity org mailing list enter your

economic outlook and clues on future decisions 3 new zealand rbnz official cash rate 03 27 2019 wednesday 01 00 gmt the reserve bank of new zealand decided to leave the official cash rate at the same record low level of 1 75 percent during the meeting on february 13 2019 this was widely expected by the analysts according to policymakers low interest rate supports domestic inflation and economic

by published by the foreign policy research institute by mason richey fpri donald trump does not have a foreign policy he has moods regarding international affairs underneath the volatility of his moods however are some convictions namely that other countries are robbing the u s through trade u s allies are at best incapable of defending themselves and unwilling to spend resources in order to do so multilateralism is for the weak and widespread application of u s military power to underpin the prevailing international order is a wasted and failed endeavor in many respects these convictions are fundamentally wrong over the long term the u s has benefited enormously from commitment to open trade alliances beyond immediate transactional quid pro quo multilateral international order and u s global power projection the real tragedy of trump s inability to recognize these facts is the negative consequences that his failed foreign affairs beliefs and choices frequently have for those affected by them trump simply makes a lot of bad foreign policy decisions that hurt everyone from u s domestic consumers to businesses with international supply chains to leaders of u s allies in europe and the indo pacific and for some foreign policy decisions such as the abrogation of the iran deal or engagement with north korea the jury is still out nonetheless occasionally trump s convictions feed instincts leading him to decisions that are fundamentally right ironically however even when trump makes ostensibly good foreign policy choices he executes them so badly or approaches them from such a chaotic and skewed vantage point that even those who normally would support the policy in question end up obliged to reject it a cursory examination of three of trump s major international priorities relationships with allies the war in syria and u s china trade relations is indicative of this incongruous dynamic trump s treatment of allies arguably the most enduring of trump s foreign policy blunders will be his alienation of u s allies particularly in europe his rhetorical antagonism and extortionate attempts to compel their increased defense spending both on burden sharing and purchases of u s technology portend a change to less cohesion and more conflict between the u s and its allies in europe and the indo pacific this behavior is pushing forward a new normal in which the u s and its allies consider themselves to have different approaches to international affairs and fewer overlapping interests this is dangerous for u s security as the u s national defense strategy identifies the u s alliance network as an asymmetric strategic advantage vis à vis competitors such as china or russia if abandonment fears on the part of the u s s european and indo pacific allies could be leveraged for greater alliance investment and strengthening in the long run then some pressure would make sense but trump has undermined this potential outcome by going too far stoking right wing illiberal nationalism in european states domestic politics fundamentally calling into question nato the eu and u s commitment to indo pacific hub and spoke allies and browbeating and humiliating european and asian allies while failing to acknowledge the strategic advantages that u s basing rights overseas represent for u s global power projection moreover trump seems to misunderstand basic facts about alliance burden sharing both multilateral and bilateral and couples his distaste for alliances with a general destabilization of the international order yet for all that his instinct that u s allies particularly in nato should meet their defense funding obligations such as the 2 of gdp threshold for nato countries is a good one supported by many defense and security experts both in the u s and internationally the open hostility of his rhetoric and the malformed reasoning behind extortionate demands such as the recently unveiled cost plus 50 concept weaken the persuasiveness of the serious voices who have pushed and continue to push for greater commitment from u s allies at the very least it makes allied advocates for greater defense spending seem aligned with a u s president who apparently does not care about the interests of allied states this dynamic hurts their public credibility at worst it undermines these voices ability to broker political deals necessary to overcome headwinds on an issue that is sensitive throughout europe and the indo pacific trump s withdrawal decision there are many good arguments for why the u s should not have an armed forces presence in syria and thus why trump should withdraw u s troops from that war ravaged land to begin with trump campaigned on the promise to leave syria and a small majority of the u s population supports the withdrawal policy there is also little evidence that the u s military role in the country has led to better security outcomes for syria moreover as many have argued from the political right left and center as well as from both realist and institutionalist perspectives u s military participation in the syrian conflict arguably violates international law is unconstitutional under u s law remains hampered by undefined goals and has not successfully advanced core u s strategic interests indeed there are legitimate arguments that it undermines u s security a cynic might even argue that the best strategy for the u s in syria would simply be to let u s s enemies iran the syrian government of bashar al assad islamic state and sundry terrorist organizations russia etc kill each other and yet despite there being a relatively sizable group against the u s presence in syria trump botched the withdrawal decision the announcement was precipitous and made without either u s inter agency review or meaningful consultation with u s allies nor was the decision supported by sound strategic or political reasoning rather it was sold on the basis of patent lies about the status of defeat of the islamic state indeed isis carried out a lethal attack shortly after trump s announcement of the organization s defeat as if these self inflicted wounds to washington s reliability and credibility weren t bad enough trump apparently reached the decision after being dubiously convinced by discussions over the phone with turkish president recep tayyip erdogan whose ulterior motive is clearly not to finish off elements of remaining terrorist groups in the region thereby aiding the u s in the war on terror and much less to provide for regional stability but rather to weaken and if possible destroy the u s s kurdish allies to boot trump s decision to pull out of syria cost him his defense secretary james mattis for whom the policy changes were the last straw given their deteriorated relationship trump probably considered mattis s resignation a blessing but for most experts and allied governments it was unsettling to see him leave not only because of his reputation as the last preeminent adult at the table in trump s cabinet but also because of all things mattis left in protest of a failed policy thus slightly tarnishing his sterling image as the wise warrior monk this is not how those opposed to the u s role in syria want to see withdrawal take place if for no other reason than it has strengthened the hand of the established washington foreign policy interventionists in the end this group even undermined partially the withdrawal decision as both national security advisor john bolton and secretary of state mike pompeo walked back parts of the withdrawal commitment during their visits to the middle east in early 2019 the trade war blunder as for china trump s instinct to confront it as a strategic competitor is an overdue corrective to the west s general negligence in realizing and addressing the fact that china is a revisionist power not a responsible stakeholder in the international system this welcome step has been met with belated approval across the u s political spectrum as well as in many quarters of the business world beyond issues such as the south china sea commercial relations are a legitimate complaint vis à vis beijing which has constructed predatory trade and economic policies that protect domestic enterprises allow intellectual property right theft promote dumping practices steal technology from partners block foreign market access and require joint venture tie ups with chinese firms that force technology transfers or later reverse engineer technology and strategies from the foreign half of the joint enterprise these abuses represent not only economic problems but are also major security challenges for u s led alliances yet a trade war which trump imagines will solve the u s china trade imbalance is not the right answer to these issues quite apart from the fact that many economists do not believe the u s trade deficit with china is a problem per se in the first place trade wars to repair trade deficits do not easily lead to progress on structural issues economists disagree about many items of their discipline but they are almost uniformly united in the belief that trade wars cause deadweight losses that make all belligerents poorer the tariff based trade war with china not only acts as a tax on u s businesses and consumers but has also caused disruption in global supply and production chains instability in markets more generally and a weakening of the free trade norm that underpinned u s economic strength and so far china has hardly budged on structural reform as u s trade representative robert lighthizer recently conceded in addition trump is a poor untrustworthy messenger despite the fact that the u s is targeting a legitimate set of abuses by china consequently the optics of the trade war rollout such as using dubious national security grounds to justify tariffs have allowed china to plausibly appear a victim of u s economic aggression in general and trump s bad faith in particular as with the other examples above the whole u s china trade war situation undermines the voices of those who advocate dealing with the problem through more targeted and effective measures indeed as many of these figures have argued it is clearly preferable to confront beijing s predatory trade and economic practices through world trade organization dispute settlement mechanisms heightened regulation of chinese investments into the u s treasury department sanctions restrictions on the listing of chinese firms on u s equities markets curtailed scientific and education cooperation international coordination with like minded countries and other means ironically remaining locked into a trade war with negative spillover effects to other countries especially allies potentially pushes them away from the u s s position indeed the u s is having difficulty convincing allies including france and germany not to purchase huawei s 5g technology despite the inherent cyber risks in the end the consequences of trump s poor foreign policy choices go beyond the irony that analysts pundits and policymakers are compelled to abjure policy directions that they otherwise support good policy choices need solid execution and messaging to have their intended effects unfortunately even trump s good ideas increased allied financial commitment to security and defense burden sharing extricating the u s from some of the messiest and most hopeless aspects of middle east conflict and pushing back against beijing s violations of trade norms are undermined by his approach to concretizing policy trump is the anti midas even the gold he accidentally touches turns to dirt this warps debate about future policy choices and will restrict future options because we will have tried that before about the author mason richey is associate professor of international politics at hankuk university of foreign studies seoul south korea source this

by jonathan nack march 22 2019 cuenca ecuador sectional elections will be held throughout ecuador this sunday march 24 2019 at stake are the elections in all 24 of the country s provinces of prefects the highest elected official in a province mayors and urban and rural municipal council seats the election occurs in the context of a stagnating ecuadorian economy the government of president lenín moreno has implemented budget cuts and layoffs and also negotiated new loan agreements with the international monetary fund and world bank to deal with ecuador s budget deficit and national debt ecuador is opec s smallest producing member country nevertheless the government receives significant income from oil exports and has suffered in recent years from low oil prices the election also comes midway through president moreno s four year term as president and will be seen as a measure of his popularity opinion polls published this month showed moreno s approval rating has plummeted continuing a year long decline president moreno has broken sharply with the politics of his predecessor former president rafael correa moreno had worked closely with correa for many years serving as correa s vice president for 6 years from 2007 to 2013 and narrowly won election as president with correa campaigning for him despite all this moreno dramatically turned against correa only months after being elected president moreno accused correa and his government of rampant corruption running up the national debt and cronyism in government and judicial appointments including stacking ecuador s highest courts since then government prosecutors have been investigating correa for allegedly ordering the kidnapping of an opposition lawmaker who was hiding from ecuadorian justice in colombia as well as allegations of corruption correa was ordered to appear in court in ecuador and when he declined offering to testify via video link instead a warrant was issued for correa s arrest numerous figures in correa s administration have been and are being prosecuted on corruption charges moreno s own vice president jorge glas a close associate of correa was arrested tried for corruption convicted and is now in prison glas has continued to insist he is innocent and at one point went on a long hunger strike while in prison this past january a story broke that a telecommunication company named teleconet had agreed to return 13 5 million to the government of ecuador that had been invested by glas uncle because it said it was corrupt money ecuador requested that interpol issue an arrest warrant for correa who currently lives in belgium but interpol rejected the request stating that the evidence presented wasn t strong enough to order the arrest of the former president interpol practically said that ecuador s case against correa was likely politically motivated moreno has returned to neoliberal economic policies as reflected in the loan agreements negotiated with the international monetary fund and world bank in sharp contrast to correa s severing of relations with those institutions he has also changed the country s geopolitical orientation and warmed relations with the united states eschewing correa s anti imperialist rhetoric while turning away from former leftist allies such as venezuela bolivia and cuba moreno has recognized u s backed juan guaidó as the interim president of venezuela moreno has sought dialog consensus and compromise with many of ecuador s diverse political factions including those representing the oligarchy and moneyed classes rather than adopt correa s more combative approach while moreno has changed many policies and moved markedly to the right he has also sought to retain some credibility in left circles in an interview moreno claimed he was a new type of socialist using the ideology of the right to produce while the government distributes equitably and helps the poor according to the ideology of the left moreno said in 2018 speech at the united nations that politics are successful when they serve everyone especially the poorest and the abandoned he has also sought to be seen as a champion against government corruption a deeply rooted problem with a very long history highlighted by the prosecutions of leading figures from correa s government and even his own moreno has won praise from the u s and its allies the corporate media has lauded his new approach as a restoration of democratic norms including freedom of the press as opposed to their narrative about correa s dictatorial and undemocratic tendencies however his popularity among ecuadorians has taken a nose dive from 75 percent approval in early 2018 to only 30 percent in the very recent poll two ecuadorian polling organizations cedatos and pefiles de opinion announced their findings at a press conference on march 7th the population realizes that this economic restructuring was not taking place this real fight against corruption was not taking place and that made the approval of the president turn downward said polibio córdova president of cedatos according to a report by the reuters news service perfiles de opinion s director paulina recalde revealed that its survey found that 80 percent of respondents believe that the government is on the wrong road though president moreno will not be on the ballot in sunday s elections nor will any seats in the national assembly the president s party alianza pais ap has a lot to lose it along with allied parties currently holds the majority of the prefectures mayor s offices and local council seats in the country ap by itself has 11 of the 24 prefects 67 of 221 mayors and 527 of 1305 council seats in the country by comparison the party with the next most sectional offices avanza get moving a centrist party with a social democratic ideology loosely allied with alianza pais has 36 mayors 196 council seats but only 1 prefecture avanza holds no seats in the national assembly ap has undergone a transformation since the last sectional elections in 2014 moreno s fight with correa led to a brief struggle for control of ap in early 2018 moreno won control of the party based on some controversial judicial decisions correa was expelled from the party of which he had been the founding leader the correistas left ap en masse and immediately began organizing a new party i use the term correista advisedly to describe those on the ecuadorian left and center left grouped around and allied with rafael correa because it gives the incorrect impression that there is some specific ideology that they adhere to or that they are a monolithic block or worse that they are uncritical fanatics dedicated to correa nevertheless this is the term most commonly used to describe this political group the correistas view moreno as a traitor to the struggles for social justice and equality as well as their larger projects of building a citizen s revolution and regional political and trade alliances independent of u s hegemony and their ultimate goal of developing an ecuadorian version of what correa calls socialism for the 21st century most ominous for moreno was a finding in a recent perfiles de opinion poll of residents of guayaquil quito and cuenca ecuador s three largest cities which found that an astonishing that 70 percent of the respondents declared being sorry for having given their vote to moreno which reflects a distancing from their base of popular support said recalde at the march 7 press conference there has been some shallow coverage of the feud between moreno and correa in the english language corporate news media but two important aspects of it have gone virtually unreported the split in ap cost it it s majority in national assembly as 30 of ap s 74 elected representatives left the party along with correa and formed their own group in the national assembly called movimiento revolucion ciudana movement for citizen s revolution second the correistas were prevented from registering as a new party that could compete in sunday s sectional elections while the corporate media is filled with reports of repressive electoral irregularities in venezuela the ecuadorian government s obstruction of the correistas ability to compete in elections has been all but ignored the correistas application to register as a political party to compete in elections was twice rejected by the national electoral council cne a separate and supposedly independent branch of government that oversees and administers elections in ecuador each time the cne rejected the name of the party which it must certify in order to begin the registration process the first application to register under the name movement for citizen s revolution was rejected by the cne on the ground that citizen s revolution was a slogan of ap the phrase citizen s revolution was used by correa often when he was the leader of ap but since the split moreno and other ap officials no longer use the phrase the second application by the correistas was to register under the name movimiento revolución alfarista alfarista revolutionary movement was again rejected by the cne eloy alfaro who the party was to be named after was president of ecuador from 1895 to 1901 he was a reformer credited with helping to modernize ecuador alfaro came from a province manabi which continues to be one of the most progressive areas in ecuador the cne ruled that alfaro was not a leftist and that the leftist correistas could thus not use his name for their party the cne s rejecting of the correistas applications to form a new party created a bizarre political phenomenon the second largest political grouping elected to the national assembly correistas retain 30 seats was not approved to register as a party to compete in elections this is highly irregular and a huge aberration in democratic process it would undoubtedly attract loads of coverage and sharp criticism from the corporate media for being undemocratic and politically repressive had it occurred in venezuela the party was kidnapped by moreno in a not very clear judicial process said fernando casado a political adviser to the small party fuerza compromiso social which has entered into a last minute agreement with the correistas allowing them to run some candidates on its line in sunday s elections moreno betrayed ap s political platform he has systematically broken his commitments to the upholding the domestic and foreign policy platforms ap had agreed to casado told this reporter casado explained that in ecuador each party s political platform becomes a notarized legal document and politicians and representatives of a party including its elected officials can be recalled by the party if they do not uphold the party s written platform casado believes that under a correct application of ecuadorian election law the judiciary should have decided in favor of correista control of ap since moreno has gone against many positions in ap s official platform but the ruling went to moreno casado bristled as he recounted the tortured course the correistas have had to take in order to field any candidates in sunday s election following the cne s decisions to twice reject the proposed name of the party preventing them from even beginning the process of registering their own new party which process includes the time consuming task of collecting a large number of signatures casado said that the correistas decided to change their strategy there wasn t time to make another attempt to begin the registration process if they were going to run candidates in sunday s elections the correistas first reached an agreement with another party named movimiento acuerdo nacional national agreement movement which is known by the initials mana which the cne had approved for the signature gathering process to regain its ballot status we needed to collect 400 000 signatures and we collected 600 000 recalled casado however the day before the signatures were to be presented to the cne the leadership of mana made a surprise announcement in which they renounced the party s agreement with the correistas expelled correa from the party and announced that they would not be presenting signatures to reinstate the party s ballot status thwarted again the correistas were able to scramble and reach an agreement with yet another party fuerza compromiso social social commitment force to run candidates on its ballot line casado said that all the obstacles the correistas have faced in fielding candidates in sunday s elections have meant that they have been able to field candidates in only 25 percent of urban and 11 percent of rural districts our goal is to get 4 percent of the national vote said casado which would give fuerza compromiso social ballot status for the next election casado acknowledges that this will be very difficult since the party is fielding candidates in less than a quarter of the districts it will have to receive around 20 percent of the votes in the elections it has candidates in order to reach the 4 percent national total we also hope to win a few major victories in some places to show that our movement is still alive said casado the correistas are focusing on running candidates for prefect and mayor in a number of ecuador s major cities and provinces and areas in which they have had a strong base he explained it is an uphill struggle for the correistas which have been attacked by virtually all other of ecuador s many political parties and factions their leaders are being investigated and prosecuted for corruption with some already behind bars ecuador s mass media which is dominated by privately owned corporations keeps up a daily barrage of anti correa news reports in addition to all this the cne decisions and surprise betrayal by mapa have severely limited the correistas ability to compete in the sectional elections sunday s elections will also be important to parties and politicians on ecuador s pro capitalist political right which are jockeying to the lead opposition to moreno from that end of the political spectrum none of the major parties on the right performed well in the 2013 sectional elections and thus all are in position to make significant gains in 2017 the major parties of the right won only 4 of 24 prefectures 43 of 221 mayor s offices and 213 of 1 305 council seats this includes such parties as movimiento creo creating opportunities movement partido social christiano psc social christian party and movimiento suma united society for more action movement creo is the party of guillermo lasso a banker who narrowly lost to moreno in the presidential runoff of 2017 lasso is again considered to be a top contender for president in 2021 the psc s jaime nesbot the mayor of guayaquil is another potential presidential candidate suma is the party of quito mayor mauricio rodas another popular politician on the ecuadorian right another party with a fair amount at stake on sunday is the pachakutik plurinational unity movement it is a political party which seeks to represent ecuador s indigenous communities pachakutik has a radical leftist and environmentalist platform and has long been a left critic of ap including during correa s presidency the party has recently led militant anti mining struggles to prevent environmental destruction and water pollution pachakutik will be trying to hold on to it s 4 precfectures 23 mayor s offices and 92 council seats it will challenged in its stronghold of manabi province by correista candidates sunday s election will also feature a local referendum in giron on whether residents approve of mining in that area the referendum became controversial when the moreno government sought to stop it on technical grounds however an initial judicial victory by the government was reversed by a higher court and the referendum will go forward the ecuadorian constitution specifies that development decisions such as areas open to mining and the sale of mining concessions to multi national corporations are to be made by the national government so the results of the giron referendum are advisory only ecuador is a multi party democracy with a lot of political parties many are regional and not influential at the national level the ecuadorian political spectrum is skewed to the left in comparison to the electoral spectrum in the united states liberalism on the left of the electoral spectrum in the u s is a right of center ideology in ecuadorian politics because of its strong advocacy of capitalist economics parties in the center of the ecuadorian political spectrum tend to identify themselves as social democratic progressive or populist the left of the electoral spectrum in ecuador is occupied by parties which identify with some variant of socialist politics it should be noted however that the larger parties that identify themselves as socialist have not sought to nationalize industries nor pushed policies to transition from a capitalist economy to a socialist dominated economic system the correistas did very little along those lines when they were in power only smaller socialist and communist ecuadorian parties advocate moving now to further nationalize industry ecuador founded a national oil company 42 years ago and it is currently called petroecuador ecuador s oil industry remains open to the private sector and also to multi national corporations most experts expect that alianza pais will suffer substantial losses in sunday s elections if that occurs the question is which parties those of the right center or left will benefit the most also how will this election set the stage for the 2021 presidential election voter turnout will be high as voting is compulsory in ecuador for literate people ages 18 to 65 though the voting franchise extends to all those over the age of 16

with expectations for a deal high on both sides u s and chinese trade negotiators are working under a tight time frame experts express concern that an agreement cobbled together beneath a ticking clock might disappoint corporate america and wall street reported plans for a meeting between president donald trump and his counterpart xi jinping appear to have been postponed to an as yet undetermined date possibly in april although the two countries have made public statements touting the progress made so far leaders of u s based trade groups say they have been relegated to reading the tea leaves from the sidelines some three weeks after the white house s self imposed deadline of march 1 a week ago it seemed like we were close to an agreement said craig allen president of the u s china business council i think that delay could be a cause for concern that we re not as close to an agreement as we could be he said the business community hasn t been kept fully apprised by the administration of what s going on in the negotiations said rufus yerxa president of the national foreign trade council the trump administration has touted pledges from beijing to buy more soybeans and liquid natural gas from the u s as evidence of its progress in negotiations while this would help the agriculture and energy sectors and likely score the president political points in regions he will have to defend in the 2020 election it doesn t address the biggest problems u s multinationals face in china my feeling is that the chinese have to offer meaningful changes in the way they treat foreign companies and foreign investment yerxa said we really don t know how significant the differences are between the two sides he said on key issues like protection of intellectual property and beijing s state support for its domestic businesses that compete with american firms an agreement by china to buy more u s goods also would raise the trade deficit on that export category which has risen to a record 891 billion under trump the president previously has railed against the size of the trade deficit saying on twitter last year the u s has been ripped off by other countries for years on trade boeing s current woes further complicate the situation regarding the trade deficit the plane manufacturer said last year that chinese airlines would buy 7 690 planes over roughly the next two decades for a combined value of 1 2 trillion now according to bloomberg china is said to be considering striking boeing s troubled 737 max jet from the list of goods it planned to purchase from the u s following two high profile crashes within six months that investigators say bear similarities three quarters of those chinese purchases would be single aisle aircraft boeing had said a forecast that is now in jeopardy since the max is the new version of boeing s single aisle best seller the 737 the max is currently grounded by air transport agencies worldwide even if the u s trade delegation can navigate the added complication of its biggest export driver being taken out of the equation analysts say any deal that fails to address the structural reforms sought by the u s on practices like joint partnership requirements and forced technology transfers could make the losses incurred by some american companies for naught some revenue will come back quickly soft boycotts tariff related price increases etcetera but they might have to rework their supply chains which will be a long lasting and costly issue said sameer samana senior global market strategist at the wells fargo investment institute some companies may never recover from the damage the tariffs have caused especially the smaller overly leveraged firms said george kiraly founder and cio of the lodestar advisory group forecasts of future economic loss paint a similarly disheartening picture a report published by the rhodium group a consulting firm in conjunction with the u s chamber of commerce found that the trade war s collective impact on the country s gdp could reach 1 trillion over a 10 year period across all tariff escalation scenarios the tech sector a key driver of the current market rally would be especially hard hit import tariffs can shield domestic production from competition that can encourage inefficiencies one thing is clear we see a pretty strong negative impact on productivity and resource allocation said lauren gloudeman a senior analyst at the rhodium group of more immediate concern a failure by u s negotiators to win key concessions could have ramifications on the stock market if the scope of any deal is less comprehensive than wall street expected investors may face a reckoning markets might rally a bit further but a lot of optimism is now priced in on the announcement of a trade deal samana said we still think a deal is the most likely outcome but it s hard to tell what the quality of the deal will be in terms of how whether it deals with the tougher issues he said any trade deal announced between the u s and china is likely to disappoint kiraly cautioned it will likely be a case of buy the rumor sell the news for the markets it s pretty much priced in as stocks have rallied strongly in anticipation of a deal he said jacob kirkegaard senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics suggested that members of trump s trade team might be starting to realize the intractability of their predicament from a diplomatic as well as an economic perspective underneath all of this you increasingly have the realization in the administration i think that you re not going to get these fundamental changes in the chinese economic model he said pointing out that state support and protectionism are key tenets of its economic model it s clear that xi jinping believes these enterprises are very important for china s future kirkegaard said he s not going to change his economic philosophy and master plan for china to get this deal even with the biggest economy in the world the u s has few effective mechanisms for oversight and enforcement in forging a bilateral trade deal without the international backing of groups like the world trade organization a bilateral agreement is very difficult to enforce said allen of the u s china business council these are ideological and emotional as well as practical and nationalistic issues on both sides that does not lend itself to stability and predictability trade negotiators for the u s could insist that beijing demonstrate its willingness to address american concerns before it rolls back trade sanctions but keeping tariffs in place is likely to be a nonstarter for the chinese delegation creating a stalemate with no obvious path forward unless one side or the other yields a hastily forged trade pact that centers around china s willingness to purchase more american goods might let trump claim a victory in the run up to an election year analysts warned though that any deal that leaves the threat of tariffs on the table is likely to exacerbate stock market volatility which in turn could magnify the impact of an ongoing economic slowdown going forward low global growth risks will remain kiraly said what s ailing the global economy is unlikely to be resolved by a trade deal he said but a poor or nonexistent deal could be one headwind too many
as the clock has ticked down towards brexit the state of the uk has attracted even more attention than normal every scrap of official data and every survey of business opinion has been pored over by leavers and remainers alike much less attention understandably enough has been paid to what is happening in the rest of the european union where the recent news has been poor the frustration of the leaders of the other 27 eu countries towards theresa may is that europe has plenty of issues that need addressing with brexit not even the most serious of them the eu s biggest problem is that its economic model has aged alongside its population europe has plenty of world class companies but unlike the us none of them were set up in the past 25 years in europe s golden age volkswagen was a rival to ford and siemens could go toe to toe with general electric but there is no european google facebook or amazon and in the emerging technologies of the fourth industrial revolution such as artificial intelligence europe is nowhere china is making faster progress than europe in the development of machine learning and has companies that pose a threat to the giants of silicon valley that s why china rather than europe is the main target for donald trump s tariff war when plans for the euro were being drawn up 30 years ago the assumption was that the single currency would make the single market work more efficiently and so generate faster growth it hasn t happened the performance of the eurozone countries has got worse not better but so much political capital has been invested in the monetary union project that there is an unwillingness to accept as much a real solution to europe s growth problems means fixing the design flaws in monetary union three separate events last week highlighted the extent of the economic challenges europe faces firstly the latest health check on the eurozone economy showed that growth remains chronically weak italy is suffering from its fifth recession in two decades while germany s export dominated economy is being hit hard by the slowdown in the global economy germany escaped recession only by the skin of its teeth in the second half of 2018 and early 2019 has seen little improvement the eurozone as a whole appears to be on course to grow by 0 2 in the first three months of the year unchanged on the last three months of 2018 there was a brief period when heavy doses of stimulus from the european central bank ecb lifted the eurozone s growth rate but the impact of zero interest rates and the money creation process known as quantitative easing qe has now worn off a real solution to europe s growth problems means fixing the design flaws in monetary union something that has been glaringly obvious since the financial crisis of a decade ago the lack of a political underpinning to the single currency proved costly back in 2008 09 while the us and the uk moved quickly to cut interest rates and embrace unconventional monetary policies such as qe it took much longer for the eurozone to crank itself into gear in part that was due to the ultra conservative nature of the ecb which imported its culture from germany s bundesbank but it was also due to the fact that there was no real mechanism for taking the sort of speedy decisions made in washington and london like any convoy the eurozone moved at the speed of its slowest ship there were two important consequences of this it took a lot longer for the eurozone to return to growth and its banks were left saddled with large quantities of non performing loans the americans socialised the bad debts of the big us banks which enabled them to start lending again europe s banks remain weak and highly vulnerable to another economic downturn which is why the second significant event last week was the announcement by two of germany s biggest banks deutsche and commerzbank that they were in merger talks sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk italy has tired of waiting for monetary union to deliver its banks are in even worse shape than germany s rome has no control over monetary policy and its attempts to boost growth by running a bigger budget deficit have fallen foul of europe s hardline fiscal rules last week italy s government announced it would be the first eu country to take part in china s belt and road initiative an attempt to link asia the middle east africa and europe with a series of ports railways bridges and other infrastructure projects italy s willingness to take part in the attempt to recreate the old silk road reflects its desperation to revive its economy by any means available it also reflects europe s diminished status in the global pecking order emmanuel macron is convinced the answer to europe s economic problems is closer integration the french president wants the eurozone to have its own finance minister in charge of tax and spending policy for the single currency zone but for the idea to catch on macron needs the support of germany and angela merkel has not been wildly enthusiastic it s not hard to see why german exporters have done well out of monetary union and merkel knows that german taxpayers would be expected to bankroll spending in poorer eurozone countries macron s plan has a logic to it the eurozone is a half completed project lacking the political structure that would give it a chance of working what s more if europe continues to underperform economically the alternative to closer integration is disintegration not immediately because returning to national currencies or moving to a hard and soft euro would be fraught with difficulties crunch time will only come when the next recession blows in it might not be all that far away
nigeria may have about the best performing eurobonds in emerging markets this year but the government says it will prioritize borrowing from concessional lenders such as the world bank and african development bank to cut interest payments if you were to ask me if we re going to issue eurobonds this year i d say we ll explore all the options director general of the debt management office dmo patience oniha said recently in abuja our preferred option is to explore concessional sources one of our major objectives is to reduce debt service costs nigeria s 2019 budget presented by president muhammadu buhari in december and yet to be approved by lawmakers envisaged the government issuing about 1 65 trillion naira 4 6 billion of new debt half of which would be in foreign currency africa s biggest oil producer has mostly used the eurobond market for its external funding in recent years rather than concessional lenders it sold 5 4 billion of bonds last year and 4 8 billion in 2017 making it africa s most prolific issuer in that period after egypt bank of america said in a research note this month that nigeria would probably print another 3 billion of securities in the second half of 2019 its eurobonds have returned 14 4 percent since the end of 2018 second only to kenya among sovereigns in emerging markets according to bloomberg indexes african eurobonds have been in heavy demand this year as the u s federal reserve s cautious approach to raising interest rates spurs investors to buy higher risk assets ghana and benin sold 3 6 billion of bonds between them on tuesday while nigeria s ratio of debt to gross domestic product is low relative to other governments at about 25 percent its small tax base means interest costs as a proportion of revenue are high the federal government s interest payments to revenue more than doubled to 60 percent last year from 27 percent in 2014 according to the international monetary fund the figure is on course to rise to 82 percent by 2022 which the washington based lender says is unsustainable oniha reiterated that while the government is always speaking with the world bank and african development bank it won t borrow from the imf we ve made it clear we re not in the situation where we need imf support she said
the gleaner s front page headline in an affectionate play on words dubbed finance minister dr nigel clarke santa clarke essentially capturing his gift giving budget the minister has received rave reviews from analysts editorials the jamaica chamber of commerce jcc the private sector of jamaica psoj and the small business association even the jamaica dollar making provision for equity and growth in the budget has signaled its approval by continuing to strengthen against its us counterpart so what am i missing somehow something must be wrong with me or am i just a contrarian when i look at jamaica s pressing problems at this time i thought the minister did not use budget allocations especially in the area of taxes foregone on real estate transactions judiciously it would have been better to use those billions of dollars to make a convincing statement and set a tone that structural impediments bottlenecks and social dysfunction must be addressed forthwith annual budgets are not just numbers reconciling revenues and expenditures they are about values and direction priorities and principles headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters for decades the annual addition to the housing stock especially for lower middle income workers has been abysmal in addition the income limitations for large numbers of hard working jamaicans means that their ability to qualify or even service mortgage payments irrespective of declines in interest rates and transfer tax foregone is a pipedream seven hundred thousand people squatting is no accident and it produces a ramshackle existence especially in unplanned communities exceeding density requirements basic amenities are inadequate well being is stifled and there is little in the way of economic choices in terms of allocation of scarce resources the result large segments of the domestic economy need rehabilitation and revitalisation and when aligned with tourism enclaves there is a huge divergence as such we are missing higher levels of expenditure improved security and economic growth because of inadequate interchange between the domestic economy and the tourism sector to emphasise my point travel to our tourism dominant cities where huge construction of hotels is taking place and show me the corresponding amenities and mix of high rise apartments and ground level housing units both rental and owner occupied for the thousands of lower middle income earners in the hospitality sector that should be in any budget announcement both an emergency and a priority especially as so much of our foreign exchange needs apart from the mining sector are satisfied by tourism earnings tourism arrivals and the diaspora it is not surprising therefore that the recent two tier advisory from the united states state department warns us travelers about going to places such as canterbury clovers street flankers hart street norwood rose heights in our tourist capital montego bay we can deflect the warning as tourism minister ed bartlett did saying customer value proposition that jamaica offers is at such high levels that visitors come with certain knowledge that they are going to be safe because our record of visitor safety is exemplary but we still have to address this at some point no new squatting with government revenue intake more buoyant than forecast and the country getting a half per cent break in the primary surplus the government s emphasis should have been less on monetary and fiscal policies and more on specific strategies dealing with structural impediments this would be done by improving value added and professionalism in the workplace something i will deal with in a column on education reducing the divergence between the domestic sector and the tourist enclaves and confronting head on new squatting occurring while doing research data collection and instituting a long term programme for correcting this intractable problem as the government promised with that in mind i thought the government would repay 10 billion of the 20 billion both governments raided from the national housing trust nht for budgetary support nht with replenished resources taking the lead role with university of technology s utech urban and regional planning department university of the west indies uwi engineering department under the indefatigable paul aiken and with many of our local architects and engineers could create amenity driven neighborhoods as part of emergency responses to decades of neglect a tendency of our governments is to spend heavily on new concepts and shiny ideas and forget bedrock professionals important institutions maintenance and relevant departments oftentimes we lose out on technological applications and modernisation i am thinking of our municipalities and more specifically our planning departments which given our topography and the magnificence of our mountains our rolling plains and our sea should be first world by virtue of pay technology data field agents management professionalism and performance a budget by virtue of allocating resources thereby establishing priorities should have been unequivocal in laying down the gauntlet no new squatting our river banks our gullies the fire hazards legitimising illegality have to stop makes no sense dr clarke who is so bright and imaginative conceded this reality in his budget presentation when he said we need to rekindle domestic economics business and transaction activity if we are to elevate domestic value added and growth he has the right idea but i believe used the wrong fiscal tool my beef with the minister s budget is how can billions be foregone in stamp duties and taxes on real estate transactions in an already overheated property market where high end purchasers are driving escalating market prices in an environment where land taxes as against property taxes makes absolutely no sense furthermore for lower middle income earners in an economy with badly skewed income reducing transfer tax to help them make a five per cent down payment still leaves them in a quandary as to how to service the mortgage this move will add nothing to growth and higher valued employment which the society badly needs the housing stock for lower middle income workers should have been increased and the budget is where it all begins in the weeks ahead i will look at other budget weaknesses with education and the programme for advancement through health and education path the transportation sector and

according to government estimates millions of mexicans still don t have bank accounts which limits their access to financial services and consumer loans mexican officials have been pushing for a greater involvement of the population in the so called formal economy suggesting a greater number of bank accounts could spur consumer lending in the country which would boost the services sector and broaden gdp growth this comes after reports revealed that the mexican economy slowed in 4q18 due to the government s new austerity measures aimed at cutting fiscal spending and boosting the efficiency of public finances additionally international trade tensions the slow implementation of the new usmca trade accord with the us and canada and oil sector woes have all contributed to the slowdown the government data suggests mexico s economy grew 0 2 percent quarter on quarter in the last three months of 2018 while annual growth stood at 1 7 percent in the fourth quarter in 2018 the mexican economy expanded 2 0 percent lopez obrador s party introduced a bill in the mexican congress last year which would limit banking services fees the move sparked a sell off in banking shares in the country while the president distanced himself from the initiative
it is difficult to imagine another sizeable help to em assets he noted given that the markets already have a very good idea of the ultimate size of the balance sheet which the central bank said it will stop shrinking in september if the fed does pull another surprise he said it may be because of a deteriorating outlook for us growth which will be more harmful for risky assets you only need to look at last year for a reminder of the influence the fed can wield over emerging markets the year started with a rally helped by a strong consensus among investors that the us dollar would weaken when that proved misplaced em assets suffered their deepest sell off since the taper tantrum of 2013 itself triggered by the fed s announcement that it would begin cutting its bond buying programme when dollar strength then peaked in the fourth quarter of last year em assets rallied investors began 2019 in better spirits and january s sharp rally reflected confidence that the fed would hold off from raising rates as trade tensions between the us and china appeared to recede yet that buoyant start to the year has run out of steam mr brooks at the iif believes the explanation lies in how investors were already positioned in em assets he and his colleagues analysed balance of payments data from 25 emerging economies to find changes in each country s international investment position iip in portfolio assets or the value of stocks and bonds held by foreign investors between 2010 and 2018 which included years of very heavy quantitative easing there were few surprises both flows and less consistently valuations contributed to a huge build up by foreigners of holdings of the stocks and bonds of ems advertisement last year these iips fell but it was almost all a result of falling prices rather than investors pulling out money en masse international em investors it seems took the hit to their portfolios without significantly withdrawing cash if this is true it suggests that holdings of em assets remain hefty and may not have much room to increase the basic message is that after all these years people are sort of risked up said mr brooks not only that today s flows into ems he believes consist of a rising proportion of retail rather than institutional investors for each dovish surprise the incremental flow is less and of worse quality he said it s getting flightier and flightier it s not the long term sticky money that people need because conviction levels are so low kevin daly senior em debt manager at aberdeen standard investments said the fact that people did not yank money from em assets last year may also be because the pain across markets was widespread in 2013 the fed driven shock was particularly severe for developing economies whereas 2018 was a bad year for almost all risk assets everywhere in fixed income bonds sold by em governments in local currencies suffered particularly badly they remain vulnerable to a dollar rebound this year noted mr daly advertisement of all the headwinds that existed in 2018 and have faded in 2019 i would say that dollar strength is the one risk that could reappear in 2019 he said so i m not surprised that local currency debt has lagged hard currency debt the fed could of course change its view again but if it does hold steady for the rest of the year the key forces will be the us china trade dispute and the broader outlook for the chinese economy the outcome of the talks between washington and beijing remains hard to predict and the reception of the latest chinese car sales figures shows how nervy investors remain about the outlook for the world s second biggest economy a fall in sales of new vehicles caused a wave of worry perhaps unwarranted used car sales are rising strongly as the market matures mr daly said january s surge in em bonds and stocks unnerved investors and prompted some to cash out the current slow grind upward in em assets he said is altogether healthier it may be the best thing to hope for jonathan wheatley ft com financial times
jeddah despite the expectation of a relatively near term end of the economic cycle investors are not foreseeing a significant correction in fixed income and rather expect the rare event of a soft landing with a continued flat yield curve invesco said in its second annual global fixed income study an in depth report on the investment behavior of fixed income investors the study revealed that investors plan to maintain fixed income holdings in the search for yield taking a more active approach to creating diversified scenarios of return through alternatives emerging market allocations and investing in china the study conducted face to face among 145 fixed income specialists and cios across emea north america and asia pacific representing 14 1 trillion in aum also found that investors are increasingly responding to the potential for geopolitical issues to disrupt markets almost half 46 of investors have adjusted portfolio allocations in response to trade wars wholesale investors are particularly sensitive to such concerns and two thirds 65 have been influenced by brexit to alter their european and uk allocations only a third 34 of institutional investors noted that they are altering european and uk allocations as a result of brexit further investors outlook for the global economy has become more uncertain and divergent with high global debt cited as the most likely trigger of the next downturn with the current economic expansion running for nearly ten years one of the longest on record some investors are nervous about its further longevity and are alert for triggers which could end it globally the most common view 49 amongst fixed income investors is that the end of the cycle is one to two years away i e late 2019 through late 2020 however more than a quarter 27 see an end sooner within the next six months to one year when comparing wholesale and institutional investors wholesale respondents are relatively more pessimistic about the near term outlook with 65 expecting the cycle to end within 2 years regionally the study also revealed significant differences in perspectives of fixed income investors across the globe from an economic cycle perspective apac is the most convinced the expansion is on track for the next year or two while emea is the most optimistic that it could well last beyond one to two years north american fixed income investors on the other hand are less optimistic with over half 52 believing the expansion will end within a year nick tolchard head of europe the middle east africa emea for invesco fixed income said politics in the us are likely to have contributed to north american fixed income investors pessimistic outlook elevated rhetoric from the trump administration regarding trade with china europe canada and mexico plus actual tariff impositions have significantly impacted optimism from a policy and markets perspective perceptions that the fed remained determined to remove policy support and speculation of the potential for the yield curve to invert would have added to concerns when asked about triggers of the next downturn respondents were predominantly concerned with high levels of indebtedness in particular government debt the focus on debt is unsurprising in the aftermath of record low interest rates for a prolonged period investors surveyed believe a rising interest rate environment will have a significant impact on interest costs and default rates other sources of potential disruption were seen as a crisis in emerging markets the top risk of 15 of investors followed by a debt bubble in china 13 with growing nervousness around the end of the economic cycle there are some concerns about the potential for material reversals in markets although concerns are slightly tilted towards equity markets over fixed income however investors have a stronger view that credit spreads will widen over the next three years 60 and that the yield curve will remain flat for a prolonged period of time 45 by comparison fixed income investors have fewer concerns about rising inflation 34 and just one quarter 27 expect an inverted yield curve in the next few years chinese fixed income allocations are benefitting as investors look through trade war and geo political issues in their search for yield and diversification one third 32 of fixed income investors globally intend to increase their allocations to china over the next three years notably in north america 58 in the us investors are currently less likely to hold chinese fixed income products as part of their portfolio but are most likely to be increasing allocations despite rising trade tensions this is a significant shift for a nation that tends to invest predominantly in its own i e us bond markets for half 51 of global investors this is a longer term strategic decision which will be underpinned by the increased weighting of china in major fixed income indices expected in 2019 and beyond overall despite a compression in the yield premium that chinese government bonds have historically offered over us treasuries total foreign investment into china s fixed income market rose rapidly in 2018 china is the world s third largest bond market but has long been underweight in or entirely absent from the fixed income portfolios of professional investors despite supportive investment considerations such as relative valuation yield and expected total returns barriers to investing in chinese fixed income are seen as coming down prompting investors to take advantage with the main lingering barriers viewed as being the risk of the asset class government intervention and potential restrictions on capital movements nick tolchard head of europe the middle east africa emea for invesco fixed income noted while last year s relatively unified view of the new normalization scenario largely came to pass investors are now increasingly uncertain due to the growing list of potential risks from both a geopolitical and markets perspective as a result fixed income investors are actively re positioning fixed income portfolios to be better positioned to handle a variety of outcomes he added interestingly fixed income investors across the global are considering a wide variety of portfolio strategies some are targeting yield some are seeking the safety of shorter durations or cash in case volatility spikes and some want the flexibility of floating rate instruments with there being so many factors consider it demonstrates how investors need a variety of solutions to deal with the potential risks sg
the washington post reports the federal reserve is becoming more worried about the u s economy citing slower consumer and business spending on wednesday the central bank cut its growth forecasts left interest rates unchanged and indicated it won t do any hikes this year in practical terms what does this mean the fed entered 2019 predicting the economy would grow 2 3 percent and two more rate hikes would be necessary to keep the economy from overheating on wednesday the fed cut its growth forecast to 2 1 percent and the vast majority of fed leaders now predict no interest rate increases this year president donald trump will get his wish no further rate cuts however the larger problem for him and the republican party remains as a political matter if 2019 and 2020 turn out to be minimal growth years leading wages and job creation to stagnate the sole accomplishment for trump the economy could well become a hindrance not a help next year as a more substantive matter it s time to call foul on the gop s economic theory which justifies giving tax cuts to the rich and to corporations while driving up the debt trump said that the tax cuts would pay for themselves on the contrary the deficit is heading for a record high trump said that the tax cuts would somehow fundamentally alter the economy kicking us into a permanent mode of 3 percent growth that s not in the cards moreover democrats and some republicans will argue that the slowdown is trump s doing the inevitable result of running up huge deficits starting a trade war and failing to invest in infrastructure and workers indeed federal reserve chair jerome powell suggested that now is a poor time to pick fights with trading partners now we see a situation where the european economy has slowed substantially and so has the chinese economy although the european economy more he said in response to a question from cnbc s steve liesman just as strong global growth was a tailwind weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy one definitely gets the sense that we are seeing the possible end if not substantial tapering of a 10 year recovery in its post meeting statement the characterized the labor market as strong but said the growth of economic activity has slowed a u turn from january when the fomc said activity has been rising at a solid rate whatever the magic formula might be it was trump who guaranteed 3 percent growth it s trump who will be held accountable just as his bragging about the stock market made him politically vulnerable when the market hit the skids at the end of last year democrats should be restrained in their reaction the economy is not in a recession yet and unemployment remains low by historic standards the better political argument is the honest policy assessment you cannot have a strong economy over the long haul by accelerating income inequality starving government of adequate revenue to promote long term investments and going to war with trading partners in other words economic policies that trump specifically adopted in a reversal of president barack obama may be the very things that foreshorten the recovery economist jared bernstein formerly a senior adviser to vice president joe biden told me as fiscal stimulus fades i expect growth to slow this year but i still don t foresee a near term recession he said that for now the labor market and the consumer are still in solid shape democrats should not cheer the end of good times they should say that trump failed to deliver and then propose their own policies that promote growth invest in workers repair infrastructure and lessen the gap between rich and poor so have we put a stake in supply side economics which has never permanently altered the economy s growth trajectory bernstein joked if facts could kill supply side economics i d have given its graveside eulogy decades ago it is a zombie ideology that lives on because its beneficiaries hire politicians to believe it we will take that as a no jennifer rubin writes reported opinion for the washington post follow her jrubinblogger

china sri lanka chinese president xi jinping has launched the french leg of his european tour to try to drum up cooperation for his global infrastructure project advertising read more xi jinping arrived in france on sunday for a three day trip in which he hopes to gain french cooperation for his new silk road initiative he already has one european success under his belt having signed an agreement with italy a day earlier in which the euro zone s third largest economy formalised its support of china s vast programme of infrastructure investment in more than 70 countries for italian president sergio mattarella the agreement is crucial italy is counting heavily on chinese investments to among other things breathe new life into the port of trieste which looks set to be the flagship project of the forthcoming economic cooperation between beijing and rome a port built from scratch in south sri lanka for critics of the new silk road washington being the chief one italy has no need for these investments which ultimately could backfire against europe s third biggest economic power the sri lankan experience is often highlighted as an example of the dark side of the new silk road plan in the mid 2000s colombo the commercial capital of sri lanka agreed to let beijing build a new port from scratch in the town of hambantota in the south of the island it wasn t yet thought of as part of a new silk road that programme was conceptualizsed by xi jinping in 2012 but all the ingredients were there chinese funds and engineers are mobilised to build infrastructure outside china as part of a partnership that was meant to be win win this is the very definition of the rationale of the silk road said jean françois dufour economist and director of dca china analysis the chinese president integrated the sri lankan project into his silk road initiative in 2013 at the time colombo thought it could make a profit from the operation of the port while beijing would get a key point of transit in the very strategic indian ocean through which a large percentage of chinese commercial ships travel to europe the european union institute for security studies noted in an april 2018 report the project provided china with a presence in an area of fierce competition between beijing and the other great asian power india but in 2015 financial clouds began gathering over the future of hambantota s port which cost 1 1 billion sri lanka was crumbling under the debt and was unable to repay the more than 8 billion in loans it had taken from china for several infrastructure projects in the country furious beijing turned up the heat and threatened to cut off financial support to the island nation if it didn t quickly find a solution in december 2017 after two years of negotiations colombo finally agreed to turn over the port to china for 99 years in exchange for the cancellation of its debt the ports of hambantota and trieste the same struggle the concession was humiliating for sri lanka while the opponents of china like india painted the entire operation as a deliberate plan to acquire strategic positions in the region dufour said china was suspected of intentionally strangling colombo with loans at a 6 percent interest rate which was much higher than the other lenders such as the world bank from which colombo had previously borrowed dufour acknowledged that this episode shocked and pushed countries like malaysia to reconsider their participation in the new silk road but he doesn t see china risking compromising the credibility of its entire investment program for one port in sri lanka in any case the episode is a stinging reminder that the sums invested by china are not donations but loans with consequences the french economist said italy should keep the precedence in mind as it signs the silk road agreement because the italian situation bears similarities to that of sri lanka dufour said in both cases the ports had strategic importance for china trieste would be the new gateway to europe for chinese goods and italy is already a country heavily in debt dufour noted admittedly italy is economically much more powerful than sri lanka but the risk of seeing the port of trieste get away from italy remains real dufour said and for a government as nationalist as that of giuseppe conte that would be a major political failure daily newsletterreceive essential international news every morning subscribe

there is the chinese saying it is going to rain mother is going to remarry there is nothing one can do to stop that to entertain my readers i would rather rephrase the saying as follows it is going to rain china is going to rise there is nothing the us can do to stop that it is a sad world full of undesirable events even wars to kill people even if the us had not launched its prolonged wars in iraq and afghanistan leading to the death of hundreds of thousands people there there would still have been terrorist attacks and even accidents causing death and injuries we need some fun in our life as what the us has been doing to stop china s rise is ridiculous i want to make fun of that in order to entertain my readers i said yesterday in my post us regrets helping china s rise by getting it into wto that the us believed gordon chang prediction of china s collapse when china had jointed wto so that the us got china into wto however it now regrets that because china s accession to wto on the contrary has helped china s rise as i said in the beginning the us cannot stop china s rise that is because china relies on itself instead of the us to rise in fact what the us and other western countries have done has only helped instead of enabled china s rise without such help china would still have risen but only a little slower now what the west especially the us is doing facilitates china s rise again western pressures facilitates removal of opposition to further opening up us current administration must be cleverer it is conducting a trade war to force china to make concessions of opening its market wider reducing us trade deficit with china stopping forced transfer of technology protecting intellectual property and preventing devaluation of chinese currency china no longer needs the protective measures it has kept since it began to open up as chinese enterprises have grown strong enough in fact such measures protect local industries from competition with outsiders they reduce instead enhance chinese enterprises incentive to improve themselves in order to win competition protectionism only protects backward enterprises china s labor costs have risen to the level that it is no longer able to maintain its labor intensive products competitive on world market there are two measures to resolve that problem 1 improve technology to reduce number of workers employed in production in order to reduce labor costs that will cause enterprises to lay off some workers and 2 move labor intensive industries to countries with lower labor costs it will also result in unemployment of some workers local governments certainly oppose such measures as both may give rise to the problem of unemployment moreover as moving factories abroad incurs some costs in moving equipment and training local workers enterprises affected also oppose that therefore vest interests in enterprises and local governments affected strongly oppose further opining up however us tariff hikes force them to adopt the above mentioned measures removal of their opposition also facilitates china s investment abroad especially investment in and even takeover of foreign high tech enterprises trump s trade war and eu s demand for further opening up helps china overcome the opposition west restriction to china s acquisition of foreign high technology the us has already imposed some strict restriction to chinese investment and other western countries have also been planning to do so china has to further open up so as to enjoy other countries opening up to its investment there us and western pressure helps chinese leaders overcome the opposition to further opening up in the past china obtained lots of quite advanced technology through transfer of technology to its joint ventures with foreigners but none of the technology is the best in the world as foreign companies are not willing to transfer their best technology for fear of losing their competitive edge china has grown rich and is able to pay for the best technology or takeover of foreign companies that own the best technology it also has surplus capital to invest in other countries the us strictly restricts china s takeover and investment in high technology for fear that china s further rise may make china a rival world hegemon or even surpass the us as the only hegemon in the world other developed countries that have some of the most advanced technology also fear china s rise as they do not know what china will do when it becomes another hegemon trade war helps china obtain high technology as mentioned above china is no longer able to obtain the best technology through joint ventures it has to buy technology from or take over foreign enterprises of high technology us trade officials want china to allow foreign enterprises set up enterprises or joint ventures without the requirement for technological transfer that is really stupid a wholly owned foreign enterprise in china has to employ chinese staff and workers as foreign ones are too expensive to employ in china chinese employees there will soon learn the technology of the foreign enterprise that is why international lawyers help foreign parties get chinese joint venture partners and their employees to sign non disclosure agreements to keep the technology they leant confidential for joint ventures the agreements aim at preventing competitors not the joint venture partners from learning the secret as the technology has already been transferred or licensed to the chinese partners a wholly foreign owned enterprise however can only sign non disclosure contracts with its technical personnel but a real expert may get employed in the enterprise as a common worker and learn the technology when he has only seen it with his professional eyes china can selectively provide preferential treatment for foreign enterprises to attract them to set up wholly owned high tech enterprises in china that will enable china to learn their high technology the us helps china protect its intellectual property china is now able to develop lots of its own intellectual property so that it has great need for protection of intellectual property how can it expect other countries protection of its intellectual property if it cannot protect others therefore us trade war demand for protection of intellectual property provides china precisely what china wants for reciprocal protection the us helps china reduce financial dominance of us dollar in the past china might have the desire to reduce the exchange rate of its currency in order to stipulate its exports to earn foreign exchange it needs for import of foreign advanced technology but there are no such needs now china has already been able to earn trade surplus and accumulated world largest foreign exchange reserve however due to the financial dominance of us dollar most of china s foreign reserve has to be kept in us dollar it is unable to get enough return as the us keeps interest rate very low to support its economy there is also the risk of devaluation of us dollar due to the decline of us economy and us excessive issue of money for its excessive spending china needs to maintain the exchange rate of its currency stable and even make it rise a little to facilitate turning its currency into an international currency in order to reduce us financial monopoly us president trump s trade war demand for china not to reduce the exchange rate of its currency is precisely what china wants from the above we see what the west especially the us is pressurizing china to do will benefit china will the us regret what it is doing now later we know the us will be benefited by what it may get from china in forcing china to conduct further reform and opening up but china will also be benefited if what the us wants is to stop china s rise it will regret even though it has been benefited however such regret is stupid just as it was stupid to regret having china join wto china s rise has enabled china to provide lots of cheap goods for us consumers that has enabled them to make ends meet in spite of the hardship they encounter due to america s declining economy article by chan kai yee

in george orwell s 1984 the dictatorship of oceania controlled perceptions by continuous propaganda broadcast through the telescreen and constant updating of news print so that the past would conform to the lies of the present the device used to discard any document contradicting the fakery of the present was called a memory hole orwell was acutely aware of the fact that empire thrives on imperial amnesia and constant historical revision of the past by the powerful he knew that citizens would be much easier to control if they were forced to live in an eternal present a place where it would be impossible to critically assess and compare today s world by looking at what happened yesterday and the day before in the 21st century we have constructed our own kind of orwellian memory holes the global nexus of economic and political powers in neoliberal corporate capitalist states and international bodies tend to view critical and historical consciousness as an impediment if not an outright threat to their hegemony the reason is obvious an informed critical consciousness is the foundation upon which any flourishing democracy is built where the political is understood as government of by and for all citizens not merely in the interests of the wealthy or powerful few no doubt this was why the wall street journal bloomberg news and the new york times could without a hint of irony claim that u s democracy was undone because a foreign power put trump into office while simultaneously praising venezuela s opposition leader juan guaidó after he received a directive from vice president mike pence that he should just forget about elections and declare himself president gore vidal once said we are permanently the united states of amnesia we learn nothing because we remember nothing yet even in the u s it is still possible to uncover a history of the present where central and south america are concerned if you are prepared to put in the necessary time and effort you can discover the truths and realities of a past that many of those in power would rather you just forget here s one of the key geopolitical lessons you ll learn the u s empire and its regime change proxies the organization of american states oas and the lima group have never had much interest in or respect for the sovereignty of any central or south american country that did not show the proper level of obedience to the u s government and corporate interests this imperialist perspective goes back to the 1823 monroe doctrine when the u s determined that only it had the moral authority to say who should be in power in its own back yard reacting to the monroe doctrine simon bolivar the great revolutionary who helped south america gain independence from spanish rule accurately predicted that the u s was destined to plague and torment the continent in the name of freedom bolivar s prediction has been borne out time and again as the u s imposed economic sanctions and funded right wing military dictatorships in honduras panama cuba nicaragua guatemala chile the dominican republic el salvador and venezuela pence s intervention in the affairs of a foreign state follows on the heels of a long tradition of u s economic and military interventionism in central and south america the dictators put in place from nicaragua s anastasio somoza garcía honduras s roberto suazo córdova and roberto micheletti panama s manuel noriega and chile s augusto pinochet all had one and only one objective to turn what were once social democracies into subservient satellite states so that the u s might then gain access to resources and oil privatize state assets and impose what journalist and author naomi klein has accurately described as neoliberal shock therapy so long as abrams is the u s s special envoy there will not be anything remotely democratic or humanitarian in u s aid but empire is also aided and abetted by the hypocrisy of allies that cower before imperialist states while pretending that they subscribe to the norms of international law canada austria portugal britain denmark france germany spain the netherlands and sweden have all endorsed guaidó s claim to a de jure presidency while italy mexico ireland and greece have so far refused to go along the latter group of countries likely concluded what anyone with even a minimal understanding of international law would be forced to conclude guido s actions were an illegal and undemocratic attempt to usurp a democratically elected president despite this the lima group has not only signed a declaration which recognizes guaidó as the de jure interim president it also included in this declaration a measure that prevents the maduro regime from conducting financial and trade transactions and doing business with their oil gold and other assets in a washington post opinion piece guaidó outlined the case for his self appointment as de jure president of venezuela the only problem is that the de jure constitutional foundation guaidó relies upon expressly designates the vice president not the president of the national assembly as the next in line should the president not be able to carry out his duties article 233 of venezuela s constitution also elaborates just when this can occur the president of the republic shall become permanently unavailable to serve by reason of any of the following events death resignation removal from office by decision of the supreme tribunal of justice permanent physical or mental disability certified by a medical board designated by the supreme tribunal of justice with the approval of the national assembly abandonment of his position duly declared by the national assembly and recall by popular vote one need not be a constitutional expert or even a lawyer to see that not one of the six criteria apply with respect to the legitimacy of nicolás maduro s presidency maduro has not left this world he has not resigned abandoned his position or been removed by the supreme tribunal he has no permanent physical or mental disability and finally has not been recalled by popular vote moreover even if one of the above events occurred it would still be the case that an election would have to be held within 30 days of an interim president being appointed something which is obviously not of great concern to guaidó since he has already declared himself the de jure if not de facto president of venezuela those who still hold to the ideals of the bolivarian revolution grasp that their present woes are the consequence of debilitating u s economic sanctions guaidó is not the de jure president unless what is meant by de jure is someone who declares that he is a law unto himself think about guaidó in this context for a moment someone who has never been elected by anyone can declare himself as interim president so long as he is recognized by political leaders that exist outside of his or her country this is assumed to be in keeping with the notion of popular sovereignty with democracy with constitutional legitimacy what of maduro s refusal of so called humanitarian aid from the u s former united nations rapporteur alfred de zayas has said that a country which imposes illegal sanctions and has waged an economic war on venezuela for 20 years is certainly not giving aid in good faith one need only look at the history of u s aid to central and south america to know that it is rarely if ever humanitarian it was that wonderful humanitarian and fierce advocate for human rights and democracy elliot abrams who in 1987 cooked up the u s plot to use a humanitarian program to send military arms to the contra death squads in nicaragua abrams trump s recent appointee as special representative for venezuela might be the textbook case of a war criminal a well known supporter of torture death camps and decapitation abrams did everything he could to ease the way for guatemalan dictator efraín ríos montt to commit acts of genocide against indigenous people of the ixil region he lied to congress about the iran contra scandal he propped up a dictator in el salvador and cheered on the military coup against the democratically elected government of venezuela in 2002 so long as abrams one of the most radical and depraved architects of u s foreign policy in central america is the u s s special envoy you can be fairly sure that there will not be anything remotely democratic or humanitarian in u s aid to venezuela ok then what about the charge that the 2018 election in venezuela was fraudulent and undemocratic article 350 of venezuela s constitution calls for citizens to disown any regime legislation or authority that violates democratic values for this to happen both the national and international community must unite behind a transitional government that will guarantee humanitarian aid ensure that the rule of law is restored and begin to hold democratic elections however there just isn t any unity of opinion outside or inside venezuela so the very idea that this article is being relied upon as grounds for recognizing guaidó as the de jure president is completely unfounded the u s did everything possible to undermine the 2018 election precisely so they could later claim that it was fraudulent and undemocratic why venezuela is a federal presidential republic and like most democracies it is grounded on the separation of powers with government divided into three branches legislative executive and judicial the legislative branch or national assembly declared maduro illegitimate on the day of his second inauguration however the judiciary the supreme tribunal of justice the highest court of law in the bolivarian republic of venezuela empowered to invalidate any laws regulations or other acts of the other governmental branches conflicting with the constitution has countered that this latter declaration was itself unconstitutional this is the sort of internal constitutional conflict that any country has the right to work out for themselves without any sort of external pressure or interference are there venezuelans who oppose the maduro government of course there are and there is no shortage of newspapers in venezuela fiercely critical of the maduro regime that is not likely something most dictators would permit the problem is that the international media focused almost exclusive attention on opposition protests those who still hold to the ideals of the bolivarian revolution grasp that their present woes are not only a result of maduro s policies but much more the consequence of debilitating u s economic sanctions which are precisely intended to accelerate the collapse of maduro s government what venezuelans need now is not more imperialist economic interventions or declarations that venezuela is a national security threat but rather some level of recognition that the 67 percent of those who supported maduro might be capable of determining what is best for their country the national electoral council declared maduro the winner of the elections and president of venezuela until 2025 secondly a majority of authorized parties that ran were not supporters of maduro 11 of them were opposed to his government those parties prevented from running were not excluded because they opposed maduro but because they violated election and constitutional law thirdly many of the right wing parties that did not run were told not to do so by the u s which argued that their participation would give legitimacy i e democratic standing to an election that the u s declared in advance was not going to be democratic or fair fourthly not only did the u s encourage opposition parties to boycott the 2018 election they also demanded that the domestic opposition parties in venezuela tell the united nations not to send election observers against the wishes of the maduro government in short the u s did everything possible to undermine the 2018 venezuelan election precisely so they could later claim that it was fraudulent and undemocratic that has essentially been the norm since the very early days of hugo chavez chavez did the unthinkable from the point of view of any goodthinkful neoliberal he nationalized venezuelan oil for the benefit of the venezuelan people he defied the u s and impertinently stood as a socialist counter example for other latin american populations to emulate that kind of political and economic independence simply could not be tolerated by the corporatized u s empire what would have happened in 2000 had al gore declared himself the de jure president of the united states such upstart socialist initiatives were enough for venezuela to be considered an extraordinary national security threat and chavez to be designated a dictator despite being elected with 56 percent of the vote in 1999 and later elected with 59 percent support in 2004 would the same conclusion be drawn with respect to two recent u s presidents george w bush and donald trump where the winner of the election actually lost the popular vote a more direct and democratically representative assessment of voter support there may well have been irregularities in the last venezuelan election then again there have been well documented irregularities voter suppression and even fraud in a good number of u s elections what do you imagine would have happened in 2000 had al gore declared himself the de jure president of the united states and austria canada portugal britain denmark france germany spain the netherlands and sweden recognized him as such any such suggestion would be laughable none of this is meant to excuse the maduro government nor for that matter the chavez government both are guilty of mismanaging the economy and relying almost exclusively on oil revenues rather than diversifying venezuela s economy their narrow economic approach certainly gave rise to a state of hyperinflation a dysfunctional currency problem and the inevitable political corruption that follows from all this however it is also crucial to understand that oil companies the world bank the international monetary fund imf and the united states held venezuela s economy hostage before chavez even came to power as economist michael hudson reminds us what chavez was unable to do was clean up the embezzlement and built in rake off of income from the oil sector and he was unable to stem the capital flight of the oligarchy taking its wealth and moving it abroad while running away themselves by further imposing economic sanctions that prevented venezuela from gaining access to its u s bank deposits and the assets of its state owned citgo the u s made it virtually impossible for venezuela to pay its foreign debt this forced the chavez government into default and at the same time became the perfect excuse to foreclose on venezuela s oil resources and seize its foreign assets the ultimate goal of u s foreign policy has always been to impose economic shock therapy on weaker nations so that other social democracies in central and south america don t get the idea that they can use their own natural resources for the benefit of their citizens indeed trump s national security adviser john bolton has made no secret of the fact that u s intervention in venezuela is not about democracy but about oil and the exploitation of venezuela s natural resources this became all too evident after guaidó began to make moves to privatize the country s state owned oil company by seeking money from the economic arm of global neoliberalism the imf it is indeed time for maduro to open a new dialogue with both those who have been left out and other progressive voices it is time for him to put forward a new economic program that meets the crisis of inflation and speaks to the pain and dislocation of ordinary venezuelans this would require the kind of thoughtful diplomacy that has always been in short supply in u s foreign relations the current strategy of the u s the oas and the lima group is to ensure that maduro is unable to resolve venezuela s problems with help from a subservient mainstream media and compliant western states they will try their best to make the bolivarian revolution disappear down the memory hole we must not let that happen before you go truthout faces a serious threat after 22

what is city talk city talk allows marketers to connect directly with our audience by publishing content on cityam com stocks for a durable isa portfolio in the brexit years by edmond jackson from interactive investor with the brexit outcome still uncertain companies analyst edmond jackson picks five larger cap stocks and three aim shares for a resilient isa be aware how sentiment towards equities hinges currently on whether brexit is resolved by way of soft business friendly outcome or the uk leaves the eu without a deal if it s the latter equities are programmed to take a hit albeit some uk stocks more than others and overseas earners could rise as sterling would fall mind also if a hard brexit combines with disappointment in the outcome of us china trade talks it would shift international investor sentiment to risk off so while you could treat the stock ideas below as a notional portfolio and take a tactical approach to filling your isa after a 10 year bull market and despite central banks seemingly having abolished the business cycle with monetary management it s also much harder to have strong conviction about individual stocks so my ideas behind the following could be applied more widely than these portfolio stocks alone british american tobacco bats 3 140p with sterling based profit only a few percent of group turnover this is the kind of stock to consider as a hedge versus a hard brexit causing domestic economic damage smoking is an ethically abhorrent investment for some but i ll confess the dynamics of a ftse 100 stock over shooting on the downside in recent months then rebounding 35 per cent as if establishing a chart low are compelling british american tobacco lse bats has de rated from 5 640p mid 2017 partly due to fears around regulation of new smoking trends of menthol vaping seen as a substitute for long term decline in tobacco sales and also as defensive stocks went out of favour in the 10 year bull market quite like in the late 1990 s tech stock boom such a downtrend saw british american tobacco capitulate to 2 375p last january yielding over 8 per cent despite very strong cash flow at around 3 200p currently it yields 6 25 per cent covered 1 5 times by earnings with the forward earnings multiple around 10 times even if regulators initiate a ban against menthol cigarettes in the us estimated to constitute a quarter of bat s annual profit it could take two years for rules to be finalised and another year to come into force meanwhile defensive stocks seen as relatively immune to cyclical downturn may resume favour like the current uptrend in bat already suggests tritax big box reit bbox 144p this mid cap property investment share is fully asset backed via warehouse logistics facilities serving the digital economy its end 2018 net tangible asset value based on european real estate valuation modelling was 153p per share and its prospective yield is around 4 7 per cent a quality dividend supported by upwards only rent reviews that doesn t mean the stock can t fall in response to a hard brexit or a global crisis but you have comfort that intrinsically it s based on a retail concept now fundamental to modern life than shifts in demand for shops offices since tritax big box lse bbox declared its 2018 results on 6 march a new non executive director who is a chartered surveyor has bought 50 000 worth of shares around 143p it won t turbo charge your isa but it offers a sound risk reward profile for challenged times scope for ongoing acquisitions is provided by a prudent mix of debt equity helped by keen support among institutional investors who use tritax as vehicle for exposure to this attractive segment of the property market britvic bvic 950p this soft drinks producer is one i ve favoured from 585p as a contrarian growth play and still do two years or so ago the market was fretting over the introduction of a sugar tax liable to compromise soft drink sales but i argued britvic was already offering no sugar alternatives like fruit based alternatives to squashes and fizzy drinks in the firing line so could actually capitalise on the public health campaign against sugar moreover a teetotal trend among young people offers a long term marketing opportunity and although near two thirds of revenue is uk derived international markets are developing well with an entry into brazil intrinsically and taking into account forecasts britvic s lse bvic earning power has increased by about a third since early 2017 chart wise the stock shows defensive qualities it was near uniquely immune to the second half 2018 shake out in global stock markets and a current all time high of 950p is up on a 2018 high of 850p this year s rally has been consistently strong from around 800p such that britvic s yield is down to 3 per cent versus a forward price earnings pe ratio in the low teens so i d incline more to a hold than buy stance right now its chart also includes dips so is a stock to be aware of lest market volatility does present a better entry price pets at home pets 155p this is another mid cap stock with durable prospects should the uk or indeed global economy suffer britain is a nation of animal lovers and pets require constant expenditure on food and healthcare owners won t can t defer a minority might surrender them to a shelter during recession but overall it s a resilient near 5 billion market retail chain pets at home lse pets has had a testing time since flotation at 245p in 2014 rising to 311p then slumping to 110p by end 2018 as the group encountered managerial challenges with its expansion e g into veterinary services there were also doubts about whether a physical retail presence would be undercut by rivals online ex private equity owned businesses floated previously have also been doubted by investors yet this group has successfully diversified its offerings online and looks well structured marketing wise under a new chief executive since april 2018 as a complete pet care company while i ve been keen on this stock since 113p last august when insiders were buying i ve two chief concerns which may explain why it s priced for a generous 5 per cent yield and the forward pe multiple is modestly in the low teens firstly the grooming salons could be exposed to a fall in uk consumer spending though for now employment and wage growth are strong secondly last october s balance sheet showed 187 million trade payables versus 69 million trade receivables the chief reason the current ratio is slightly negative despite 60 million cash in context of 193 million longer term debt i never like a big disparity in trade payables receivables as you wonder if profit is flattered by late payments to suppliers but if the new boss can tidy up this helps create upside as the balance sheet de risks petrofac pfc 490p this is a riskier stock but merits attention for a high calibre underlying business in oil gas industry services a two year old probe by the serious fraud office sfo into bribery allegations drags on although individuals involved have left and the unaoil scandal involves plenty more companies it has so far not resulted in reputational damage customers continue to cut deals with petrofac lse pfc and its overall sound 2018 results put the stock on a normalised pe multiple sub 5 times yielding around 6 per cent so despite a recovery from a recent low of around 380p the share price significantly discounts a substantial fine analysts at hsbc have estimated a 640p to 750p fair value target range according to potential fines with the market price well down on 2015 s high of 1 065p though the sfo could flex muscle it s not going to penalise stakeholders to the extent of crippling a business also with opec managing oil prices better nowadays this should sustain demand for industry services even if the extent of fine was to surprise the market and be spread out over years potentially compromising dividends a stock set back would more likely present a buying opportunity petrofac has eliminated debt and has net cash of around 70 million equivalent its ceo owns 18 5 per cent of the group and will eventually retire thus given its services are well respected and essential for the oil gas industry i d rate petrofac a long term takeover target the chief near term risk would be an off chance of us china trade relations breaking down once again such that traders reverse the current oil price rally demand for services tends to closely accord with oil prices hence global slowdown would also present a risk aim listed specialist financial stocks three such examples offer opportunities for the medium term after de rating sharply in the fourth quarter of 2018 burford capital lse bur is by far the largest capitalised near 3 6 billion with its stock around 1750p continuing very strong performance by its litigation finance investments may well be resilient to any global downturn given litigation is prone actually to increase during recession against a risk of more rivals appearing in this space burford is diversifying to become a litigation investment bank which given its us orientation and management could well mean it becomes a wall street takeover target mind the scope for earnings volatility even so despite a roaring run since i drew attention around 110p back in 2014 also a lock up period ending that could trigger insider selling and the stock last year showed vulnerability to a shift in market sentiment falling nearly a third but litigation finance looks to have further mileage internationally and burford is leader in this field so continue to buy the dips miton group lse mgr at 57p is another one potentially exposed to a markets setback as a fund manager where its reputation for small cap stocks could accentuate downside in the event of uk recession but as i ve recently profiled after its 2018 results as a near 100 million business it is well positioned to capitalise on the fundamentally attractive economics of asset management with operational gearing as funds expand versus relatively fixed costs despite near term risks i see this business as significantly larger on a 5 year view hence a stock to accumulate h t group lse hat around 300p is a 115 million pawnbroker and small scale personal lending group well positioned to thrive in a more challenging financial environment its 2018 results showed all round double digit progress versus a forward p e of only 8 times albeit modest dividend growth of 5 per cent for a near 4 per cent prospective yield as recently discussed i believe the stock s 2018 de rating from a 370p high presents an opportunity to accumulate likewise in any brexit related market drop price is also nearly

there s no question that e commerce has been a rewarding sector for investors the best of these companies have delivered blockbuster returns and that pattern is likely to persist as we do more of our spending online driven by faster delivery and increasing convenience as companies like amazon strive to make the e commerce process as seamless as possible we ve grown accustomed to shopping from our homes or anywhere else through our laptops or smartphones shopping online for books and electronics has been common for years but more recently consumers have embraced e commerce for things like clothes groceries and restaurant takeout why invest in e commerce e commerce short for electronic commerce is online retail if a company s primary business involves selling goods over the internet either directly or through a marketplace or more broadly facilitating e commerce transactions with software payments or logistics it can be considered an e commerce stock there are a number of reasons to consider owning e commerce stocks foremost is that the sector has a huge growth opportunity ahead as retail sales in the u s including food service total about 6 trillion annually and virtually anything can be sold over the internet currently e commerce makes up less than 10 of total retail sales at about 514 billion in 2018 the e commerce sector has also consistently grown by about 15 per year since the financial crisis and should continue to grow at that pace as online retailers keep finding new ways to make delivery faster and more convenient meanwhile more consumers are discovering the advantages of shopping online and growing accustomed to it hands holding a credit card while typing on a laptop image source getty images what s the risk of investing in e commerce faced with the rising threat from online only retailers brick and mortar chains have stepped up their web based offerings by lowering free shipping minimums speeding up delivery and giving shoppers options like in store pickup that online retailers can t match in other words physical retailers are doing their best to leverage their real estate as an advantage in the retail wars as many weaker competitors have been forced to close stores e commerce also tends be less profitable than traditional retail though online retailers can avoid store based costs like rent and staffing it s difficult to generate a profit selling on the internet thanks to factors like the cost of shipping and handling returns expenses for marketing through tactics like paid search and steep price competition online for investors e commerce stocks tend to be pricey like most tech stocks because of their sales growth and potential earnings growth therefore a bear market or a recession would also be unkind to many e commerce stocks how should i analyze e commerce stocks like any other sector e commerce comes with its own set of metrics to pay special attention to revenue growth is generally the most important metric considering that the broad e commerce category in the u s is growing by 15 a year you ll want to look for e commerce stocks with revenue growth of 20 or better not only does that show they re outperforming the sector today it also suggests their potential for long term growth investors have been willing to extend high valuations to e commerce stocks with strong sales growth despite little or no profit because they consider fast revenue growth a priority while the sector is ripe for expansion gross merchandise volume gmv also known as gross merchandise sales gms is a key metric for e commerce marketplaces like ebay and etsy gmv measures the total sales made on a company s platform including third party vendors and it can be a better indicator of performance than revenue because it s not as easily manipulated it also shows the popularity of a marketplace in a way that revenue doesn t capture for marketplace operators revenue makes up only a small percentage of gmv and it goes beyond sales commissions charged to other services like payments promotion or even shipping since gmv is the ultimate driver of performance it s a better metric to watch profit margin is also important to keep an eye on though e commerce companies often have narrow profit margins if any investors want to see at least a path to profitability for this reason it s also worth noting the percentage of revenue spent on sales and marketing companies often spend aggressively here while they are in a high growth phase and those additional marketing costs have the effect of making their bottom lines worse than if they were more mature and spending less to drive top line growth what are the best e commerce stocks for 2019 so you re looking for e commerce companies with strong revenue growth and a path toward greater profitability and ideally you want to see companies that benefit from a unique strength or a competitive advantage in their industry with that in mind the chart below shows five e commerce stocks to consider for 2019 company ticker market cap revenue growth mrq amazon nasdaq amzn 841 1 billion 19 7 grubhub nyse grub 6 8 billion 40 3 xpo logistics nyse xpo 5 4 billion 4 6 stitch fix nasdaq sfix 3 2 billion 25 1 etsy nasdaq etsy 8 4 billion 46 8 data source s p global market intelligence as of march 18 2019 mrq most recent quarter let s take a closer look at what each one has to offer why you should invest in amazon com any discussion of e commerce or even of the greater retail industry is incomplete without mentioning amazon born at the same time as the world wide web the company did more than any other to pioneer e commerce growing from an online bookseller to the behemoth it is today as a stock amazon s success is self evident since its 1997 initial public offering shares have returned more than 84 000 making it the market s best performer over the last generation at a few points this year amazon has been the most valuable company in the world amzn market cap chart amzn market cap data by ycharts amazon s stock has pulled back since its peak of around 2 050 per share last year trading down about 14 from that all time high which makes now an appealing opportunity to pick up shares but there are several additional reasons to pick up shares of the e commerce giant after years of focusing on revenue growth and building out a formidable network of competitive advantages including its unmatched product selection prime loyalty program and third party marketplace and fulfillment business amazon is now reaping the rewards with annual revenue reaching 233 billion a year making it one of the biggest u s companies by sales amazon is shifting toward profit growth its e commerce ecosystem is generating higher profit margins in north america thanks to the growth of higher margin marketplace sales and the stickiness of prime in addition the company has ramped up its advertising business taking advantage of the popularity of its website and vendors demand to make sales on amazon digital advertising is a high margin business having generated billions in profits annually for online ad leaders alphabet and facebook its growth should also help amazon which has already become the third largest digital advertiser finally the company s cloud computing division amazon web services remains a juggernaut not only is it the most used enterprise cloud provider in the world but it s also growing quickly and putting up fat profit margins with 47 revenue growth last year and an operating margin of 28 4 as that segment takes up a greater share of amazon s overall revenue the company will also grow more profitable as a result of those shifts amazon s profits jumped 273 in 2018 and should continue to ramp up in 2019 though the company currently trades at a lofty price to earnings ratio of around 88 compared to 21 for the s p 500 that valuation seems more than justified based on its network of competitive advantages and expanding profitability amazon looks like a good bet to outperform the broader market once again this year why you should invest in grubhub another e commerce company with fast growth and an impressive set of competitive advantages is grubhub the leading online marketplace for restaurant takeout and delivery grubhub has been growing quickly by adding users to its existing platforms and markets expanding into new markets and making acquisitions which included seamless eat24 from yelp and levelup it s also forged partnerships with restaurant chains like yum brands and jack in the box revenue jumped 47 5 in 2018 driving earnings per share adjusted for share based compensation and one time items up 38 to 1 66 other key metrics are growing quickly as well active customers rose 22 on a year over year basis to 17 7 million daily average orders increased 31 to 435 900 and gross food sales the company s version of gmv were up 34 to 5 1 billion because of its marketplace model grubhub is able to generate wide margins with an adjusted profit margin of 15 2 last year and those should expand as the company gets bigger more than 20 of grubhub s revenue currently goes to sales and marketing costs grubhub faces ample competition in its industry from ubereats postmates and doordash among others but the company has managed to maintain its lead through acquisitions and strategic partnerships and by investing in making payments and delivery easier for restaurants and customers to handle the competition in the sector isn t surprising online restaurant takeout is growing at a healthy pace driven by its embrace by millennials improved technology and the popularity of the stay at home economy consumers can now take advantage of services like online shopping and video streaming without having to leave their house meanwhile more restaurant chains are embracing delivery according to industry research firm technomic restaurant delivery is expected to grow 12 annually over the next five years grubhub claims that its biggest competitor is not another online service but paper menus saying the vast majority of restaurants still rely on offline ordering in other words there should be a long tail of growth ahead for grubhub as it continues to take share from traditional offline ordering methods like amazon grubhub is trading at a discount from its peak last year the stock has fallen nearly 50 from its all time high however that sell off seems overdone as grubhub recently traded at a reasonable p e ratio of 42 6 analysts are also expecting the company s profits to decline modestly this year with increasing competition from ubereats and doordash potentially giving the stock a low bar to hop over in 2019 why you should invest in xpo logistics not every e commerce stock sells products directly to customers or engages with consumers at the retail level xpo logistics a provider of freight transportation and logistics services is one example of a stock that can provide exposure to different elements of the e commerce industry xpo differs from traditional package delivery companies like fedex united parcel service and even the u s postal service it specializes in last mile delivery of heavy goods like furniture and appliances as well as less than a truckload deliveries suited to small e commerce shippers retailers like amazon wayfair home depot and ikea count on xpo for delivery and xpo gains valuable data that it uses in partnership with retailers to help them with things like locating new fulfillment centers xpo has grown rapidly in recent years thanks to a series of acquisitions including trucking companies logistics services and freight brokerages that have given it a unique set of assets in logistics and e commerce the company sees its scale end to end supply chain and technology as its biggest competitive advantages it has been aggressively investing in technology spending upwards of 450 million a year on innovations like automation robotics and data management now seems like a particularly opportune time to pick up shares of xpo the stock is trading at a discount falling more than 50 from its all time high in september the stock plunged over the past few months from a combination of the broader market sell off a customer bankruptcy leading to a guidance cut another earnings warning and a short seller report by spruce point capital the report said the company s debt burden was unsustainable and called out ceo brad jacobs involvement in a previous accounting scandal at united rentals xpo for its part called spruce point s report intentionally misleading and full of significant inaccuracies then announced a 1 billion share repurchase authorization in its aftermath xpo s shares recently traded at a p e ratio of just 20 6 and the company has several catalysts working in its favor this year in 2018 the company launched xpo direct a service that rents warehouses to customers taking advantage of its network of warehouses that allow two day delivery to 95 of the u s population deutsche bank predicted that xpo direct would grow to 1 billion in revenue in a few years xpo is also prepping to make acquisitions again after a break and said it could spend as much as 8 billion to add new companies that should add a boost to xpo s already solid top line growth making the stock look cheap after the sell off why you should invest in stitch fix the age old question of what should i wear is at the center of stitch fix s business model the company is the leader in the niche industry of subscription and on demand clothing boxes stitch fix is an online personalized styling service that sends five items of clothing at a time based on customer preferences such as style fit and budget customers keep what they want and return the rest stitch fix competes against similar services like nordstrom s trunk club and bombfell but it s the biggest of the bunch with almost 1 4 billion in revenue over the 12 month period ending in january 2019 since it went public in november 2017 stitch fix has taken investors on a bumpy ride after debuting at 15 per share the stock rose as high as 52 44 but then it fell sharply on two consecutive disappointing earnings reports as concerns mounted about slowing user growth it rebounded to around 30 per share as of mid march part of the stock s volatility stems from the fact that wall street doesn t really know what to make of stitch fix it s the only pure play styling service stock and its industry is brand new the market isn t sure if fashion boxes are a real growth market or a fad the collapse of blue apron has spooked some investors who are afraid the clothing box industry could go the way of meal kit services which found profits hard to come by due to fragmentation and have since had to consolidate stitch fix is a risky stock but that s partly what gives it such upside potential the company is profitable and has been for several years with 50 4 million in net income over the past four quarters it also has a number of competitive advantages in additional to personal stylists the company uses data science and algorithms to select clothes for its customers it has gobs of data on fit and style preferences that it learns from customer feedback brick and mortar competitors get none of that information when they make a sale such knowledge informs not just the styling process but also stitch fix s inventory purchases and the development of its private label brands in many ways stitch fix s model seems to borrow from

be poised for more in a world where amazon dominates nearly every corner of online retail etsy has a rare and valuable asset a niche that can t be co opted by big corporations shoppers visit to be surprised and delighted by unique and whimsical items not to buy the kind of utilitarian products that are the bread and butter of retailers like amazon and walmart amazon actually tried to challenge etsy directly launching its copycat website amazon handmade however the smaller site has largely deflected the threat and its growth has been uninterrupted sellers have noted that amazon s terms were less friendly than etsy s charging higher commissions among other differences and etsy has millions more listings like amazon itself etsy benefits from network effects sellers in the online flea

us president donald trump on friday tapped stephen moore a conservative economic commentator and fellow critic of federal reserve policy under chairman jerome powell to join the us central bank s board of governors a move that would put a trump loyalist inside the world s most important financial institution moore who last year suggested in a radio interview that trump had cause to fire powell for wrecking our economy would add a critical and unconventional voice to a collegial committee that unanimously backed powell in keeping rate hikes on hold this month the group often reach policy decisions by consensus after debating the issues i will be nominating mr moore to the fed trump told reporters as he arrived in florida for a weekend trip he ll be great on the fed interviewed on bloomberg television on friday after trump s announcement moore said he is an independent voice despite his close ties to and support of trump s policies and said he did not want to be a disruptor but instead aimed to work closely with powell to try to make sure that america grows as fast as it can he described remarks suggesting powell and other fed policymakers should be fired as probably written in a time of anger given a very substantial mistake the fed made in raising rates in december asked if the fed should be cutting interest rates instead he said was unsure one of the things that will be really interesting for me is to hear the case look at their data and then help make the decision about whether we re too tight or too loose moore said before joining the conservative heritage foundation think tank moore had worked as an editorial page writer at the wall street journal he also was an adviser to trump s presidential campaign and holds a master s degree in economics from george mason university i have known steve for a long time and have no doubt he will be an outstanding choice trump wrote on twitter on friday elsewhere on twitter some conservative economists and fellow fed critics were less effusive trust me steve knows absolutely nothing about the federal reserve or monetary policy bruce bartlett a supply side economist who served in the republican administrations of ronald reagan and george h w bush said on twitter stephen moore is unfit to serve on the fed board monetary economist george selgin director of the libertarian cato institute s center for monetary and financial alternatives said on twitter senators mum moore whose nomination would require senate approval helped write trump s signature tax plan the nomination could test just how successful powell has been in his aggressive courting of lawmakers in his first year as fed chair moore will likely face heavy criticism from senate democrats with whom he has clashed for years the biggest question will be whether the republicans who have regularly met with powell agree to advance someone who has publicly chastised the head of the fed and agreed that trump has the power to fire him a spokeswoman for republican senator crapo who leads the senate banking committee whose support is needed before a fed governor can be appointed declined to comment none of the other members of the committee commented when contacted by reuters about moore s nomination the position would give moore a vote at the policy setting table of an institution whose interest rate hikes last year were a frequent target of trump s ire the fed has since put its rate hikes on hold citing slowing global and us growth and low inflation in the bloomberg television interview moore said he was not sure about whether the fed should cut rates and also said he needed to reserve judgment about the size of the fed s bond holdings because i don t have the full knowledge that i need but he later added that over time obviously we want to reduce that balance sheet and not have these massive amounts of debt on the fed balance sheet the fed on wednesday said it would stop scaling back the vast portfolio of bonds they built up to spur an economic recovery from the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession in current conditions the fed said it needs to have a balance sheet of roughly 3 5 trillion more than four times pre crisis levels to manage interest rates a portfolio that would at some point need to begin slowly growing again over time shifting views trump had actually won broad support for his first fed picks including powell with economists on the left and right seeing them as mainstream choices who could maintain the fed s independence from political concerns and extend a consensus shaped under previous fed chair janet yellen along with powell trump appointed respected academic economist richard clarida as vice chair randal quarles as vice chair for regulation and kansas community banker michelle bowman

asher price asherprice statesman com as state lawmakers convene this week to refine proposals to fund the state government for the next two years the marquee issues of the legislative session remain unresolved how much money to direct to schools and how to structure property tax relief even as budget writers in both chambers are like minded on any number of items on border security for example they differ by less than 10 million they remain separated by billions of dollars on schools the house budget proposal approved by the house appropriations committee last week and due to hit the house floor for debate wednesday calls for 9 billion in spending on schools with about one third devoted to property tax reduction and two thirds for texas classrooms proposals by the senate include 3 7 billion earmarked for teacher pay a 5 000 increase for every full time teacher and librarian and 2 3 billion for property tax relief the senate budget proposal will get a hearing in the finance committee at the end of the week house members have proposed increasing kindergarten through 12th grade public education spending 15 6 percent over the next two years their counterparts in the senate proposed a 10 3 percent increase but both proposals hinge on capping property tax increases with texas in recent years cutting education spending a decade ago the state provided up to 48 5 percent of education funding compared with 38 percent now school districts increasingly rely on property tax dollars state budget officials say the state needs to spend an additional 2 4 billion on schools just to keep up with increases in enrollment growth at the start of the 140 day legislative session gov greg abbott lt gov dan patrick who presides over the senate and house speaker dennis bonnen r angleton signaled that property tax relief and school finance reform were their biggest priorities budget differences how to slow property tax collection or cut tax bills altogether remains an open question at the legislature lawmakers are weighing a slew of measures on this front from constraining the rate of revenue collection by local taxing districts to dropping property tax levies in exchange for new sales taxes despite lower oil and gas prices cutting into state tax revenue comptroller glenn hegar in january said lawmakers can appropriate 119 1 billion in discretionary spending in 2020 21 an 8 1 percent increase above the amount of revenue available to be spent in the current two year budget overall the house is proposing a budget of 116 5 billion the senate 112 2 billion about 85 percent of the budget is spent on health and human services and education the state budget is the only bill lawmakers are constitutionally required to adopt before leaving austin in may the house and senate budget proposals also differ on how much to tap the state s rainy day fund which now tops 12 billion funded by oil and gas related tax collections conservatives have long been reluctant to use money from the fund but the large fund balance and the pressure on lawmakers to meet a variety of needs from subsidizing retired teachers health insurance to improving state hospital facilities to repaying state agencies that racked up expenses in the wake of hurricane harvey and paying school districts that lost property value as a result of the hurricane damage make it likely they will spend several billion dollars from that pot the house has proposed spending 2 3 billion from the fund for the 2020 21 biennium plus 4 3 billion from the fund in supplementary spending for fiscal year 2019 the senate two year budget includes no spending from the fund but that chamber s stopgap spending bill calls for tapping the rainy day fund for more than 4 billion our singular focus hammering out the details is unlikely to devolve into the name calling of recent legislative sessions when patrick and then house speaker joe straus r san antonio either directly or through their lieutenants disparaged each other the two men were rarely seen together with straus reportedly eschewing traditional get togethers with patrick and abbott since the first days of the session patrick bonnen and abbott have projected a bonhomie it helps that the legislature has largely avoided thus far the sort of divisive matters that put social conservatives and business interests at odds last session furor over transgender bathroom use exposed fissures within the republican party and spilled over into budget debates and other matters this time said rep john zerwas r richmond a medical doctor who oversees the house appropriations committee told the american statesman that while we re going to have differences we re going to work hard to get to the place where both chambers are comfortable but that s our singular focus it s not about one beating the other it s about just getting to a place that s reflective of the body as a whole you won t find two budgets that were more different last session not only in the amount but what was in them zerwas said that s the best barometer of where we are we have so many more similarities wednesday s house session is likely to be a marathon as members offer up what could total more than 400 amendments to the budget bill republicans could try to strip away funding for family planning and democrats might try to ratchet down border security money said eva deluna castro who oversees budget policy work at the center for public policy priorities a progressive think tank there could be amendments to do away with immunization subsidies driven by an anti vaccination lobby or an effort to cut film and music incentives she said the members will try to take money out of something until they get tired and see the votes aren t there and give up she said ultimately after the house and senate pass their versions of the budgets selected members will broker compromise on points of contention of late those compromise outcomes hewed closer to the senate version of the bill said vance ginn an economist at the texas public policy foundation a conservative think tank the senate he said had more negotiating power because of patrick s closeness to the governor and the lockstep republican majority in that chamber but he said shifts after the 2018 midterm elections which saw democratic gains in both chambers plus the new leadership mean the crystal ball for budget watchers remains cloudy we don t have a good feel on how this is going to work out yet ginn said

modi as pm each year of modi as pm is dealt as one stage as follows the third stage 2014 onwards the third stage of ascent and governance covers the first year of modi s rule as prime minister of india and a few important developments of this period are sketched hereunder the very first event covered here is the swearing in ceremony of narendra modi as p m which was held on 26th may 2014 the uniqueness and the historicity of this programme needs not only to be recorded but also reviewed it is important to note that a proper understanding of this event would throw light on the nature of governance likely to follow in the coming five years for the first time in the history of the swearing in ceremonies since independence foreign dignitaries from saarc countries were invited the dignitaries included nawaz shariff the prime minister of pakistan the president of afghanistan hameed karjai the president of sri lanka maheendra rajapaksha prime minister of bhutan sharing tugbey president of maldives abdulla ameen abdul gayoom prime minister of nepal susheel koirala prime minister of malaysia naveen ram gulam and speaker of bangla desh sirin choudhary all these dignitaries were seated in the first row the leading industrialists of this country were invited as special guests for this occasion mukesh ambani anil ambani gautam adani ashok hinduja shashi roy mittal brothers rajeev singh pavan manjal tulsi tantri raj kumar dhoot naresh goel mittu chandil rana kapoor r chandrashekhar subhash chandra sajjan jindal were among those invited and many of them were present on the occasion with the members of their family among the politicians chief minister of tamil nadu jaya lalitha chief minister of west bengal mamata banerjee chief minister of orissa naveen patnaik chief minister of karnataka siddaramaiah and the chief minister of kerala chandy were conspicuous by their absence while the above are stark realities what were the specialities of this grandeur invitations extended to the big business magnates and their family members amply indicated that the new prime minister modi was sending out signals to them that he would be their prime agent and a reliable ally hidden agenda behind extending invitations to the heads of saarc countries needs to be marked narendra modi had established his victory by using the card of religious polarisation but after winning elections modi wanted to establish an atmosphere of peace and harmony with the neighbouring countries behind this move modi also desired to extend an olive branch to minorities of this country through his gesture to the heads of saarc countries thus it can be said that the swearing in ceremony with its hidden agenda indicated the contours of modi s rule in future in order to understand the path which modi s government would traverse it is important to understand the composition and character of the modi cabinet forty of the 44 ministers in the modi cabinet were crorepaties arun jaitley the finance minister was the richest of the lot with declared assets worth rs 113 crores it cannot be forgotten that the prime minister modi was also a crorepati thus 90 percent of the members of the cabinet were crorepatis this cabinet also had its element of ministers with criminal antecedents as 30 percent of members of modi s cabinet had criminal antecedents in this background would it be an exaggeration to describe indian democracy as a government of the crorepaties by the crorepaties and for the crorepaties whom do you expect such a government to serve let us analyse the happenings that were witnessed within a few days of the assumption of office by modi s new cabinet state minister attached to the prime minister dr jitendra singh who belonged to the state of jammu kashmir had said there is a need to have exchange of thinking on the need to abolish art 370 of indian constitution which confers special status to jammu and kashmir this statement was designed to create a controversy on the special status accorded to jammu and kashmir under the indian constitution this statement assumed special significance as dr jitendra singh hailed from jammu kashmir and also because he was attached to the prime minister as minister of state could not one suspect that this statement had the approval of prime minister modi secondly the modi government had declared enhancing the quantum of f d i foreign direct investment in defence department from the present 26 percent to 100 percent the dangerous part of this declaration was that the modi government was throwing open a sensitive department like defence to foreign direct investments and to the private capital thirdly modi government had declared creating more than 100 smart cities in india and these were designed to help the big capitalists fourthly modi government was out to introduce another project to declare all the illegal immigrants as illegal and drive them out of india fifthly prime minister modi had issued ten commandments to all the ministers one of these commandments stated that no minister should make any appointment of senior officials of their departments and the prime minister alone would finalise them this reflected the centralising stance of the prime minister these measures introduced within one week of modi assuming office provided ample indication about the direction in which his government was designed to move during the first year of modi s rule there are several aspects that need to be analysed one issue related to modi s attitude towards the judiciary which itself has many facets facet one let us take the question of judicial appointments the prevalent practice was that the collegium of the supreme court would send a panel of names for appointment as judge of either the supreme court or the high courts and the central government would accept the panel and forward them to the president for issuance of orders of appointment based on these lines the collegium sent a panel of four names for appointment as judges of the supreme court of india to the central government the central government sent three of these names for appointment as judges of the supreme court to the president of india and separated one name from the list of four the one so separated was gopal subramaniam a senior advocate of the supreme court of india the obvious reason for separating and not sending gopal subramanian s name was that he had appeared as amicus curie in gujarat s sohrabuddin encounter case in this case the home minister of gujarat amit shah who is a close associate of prime minister modi and other officers were implicated it is for this reason that the modi government wanted to stall the appointment of gopal subramanian as a judge of the supreme court of india because of various types of reports that had appeared in the press which upset gopal subramanian even before the chief justice of india could intervene in this episode gopal subramanian wrote to the chief justice of india that his name be withdrawn from the panel however the modi government had successfully stalled the appointment of gopal subramanyan as a judge of the supreme court as they had an axe to grind against him this event evidences the apathy of modi govt towards an independent judiciary and had exhibited their inclination for a committed judiciary facet two an event that took place in april 2015 records another instance of prime minister modi s apathy to judicial independence a secret conclave of the chief ministers and the chief justices was organized at delhi on april 2015 and both the chief justice of india mr h l dattu and the prime minister of india narendra modi were present prime minister inaugurating this secret conclave said the judges while delivering judgments in litigations filed by five star activists shall be cautious and not deliver purpose driven judgments he further said if the governments commit mistakes the judiciary is there to correct them the judiciary shall under no circumstances be in the place of those who commit mistakes a keen perusal of prime minister modi s statements would reveal that they appeared like words of advice tendered by an elder brother to his younger one the question that arises in this context is if the executive head of the country starts tendering advice to the judiciary as to how the judges shall deliver judgments what would happen to judicial independence if the chief ministers of states who are executive heads start hobnobbing with the heads of the judiciary the chief justices then what would happen to the common man who looks upon the judiciary as the dispenser of justice it should be said without any reservation that the very concept of a secret conclave of the chief ministers and the chief justices envisaged and executed by prime minister modi is a dangerous one and an anathema and should be deprecated this reveals modi s design to subjugate the judiciary to the executive it is tragic that prime minister modi during the very first year of his rule sentenced to death the planning commission envisaged by prime minister nehru for achieving the planned development of india and introducing in its place the niti ayog an indepth analysis of this ghastly act of modi is needed to understand the clandestine designs of the modi government what needs to be noted here is that prime minister modi displayed his political inclination by displacing the words socialist planning and introducing market planning in its place by the founding of niti ayoga the comment of sitaram yechuri cpi m member of rajya sabha on niti ayog is worth perusing he said this is not niti ayog this is anithi and durnithi ayog another facet of the first year s rule of narendra modi is that he had got promulgated ten ordinances during the course of one year of his rule this is most unfortunate it is relevant to cite here the ruling of chief justice p n bhagavati in d c wadhwa vs bihar state he said the country shall not have ordinance rule in this light it is tragic that prime minister modi had resorted to ordinance rule in india during his very first year of administration another hidden agenda of prime minister modi came to light during the first year of his rule when the information department of the central government released an advertisement on 26th january 2015 to mark the republic day event the department had released to the press the text of the preamble to the constitution of india the paradoxical part was that the text that was released to the press was the original text of the preamble as contained in the 1950 constitution thus publishing only the words sovereign democratic republic and blatantly omitting the words secularism and socialism incorporated in the preamble by the 42nd amendment to the constitution of india during the emergency clamped by prime minister mrs indira gandhi this advertisement released by the information department of the govt of india had kicked up a controversy reacting to the controversy sanjay raut of shiv sena a bjp ally had said the two words secularism and socialism shall be permanently dropped from the preamble to the constitution he further said this country can never be secular bala saheb thakaray and veer savarkar had since the beginning said india was divided on the basis of religion pakistan for muslims and bharat for hindus and added the views of prime minister modi about hindutva are formidable congress leader manish tiwari reacting to the on going controversy said the bjp s design is to replace the words corporate and communal in place of socialism and secularism in this regard we should note the observation of the supreme court of india in s r bommai s case secularism is an inseparable part of the basic structure of the constitution it is necessary to note that barak obama president of u s a while participating as the chief guest at the republic day celebrations said it is necessary for india in the interests of its development to abide by art 25 of its constitution and keep away from religious controversies these controversies reveal that prime minister s bjp led nda government should give up riding the two horses that of religious fanaticism and development and steer itself clear of this controversy on the preamble it is high time prime minister modi should break his silence and issue a clarification regarding the controversy otherwise it will become evident that modi government has the hidden agenda of establishing a hindu raj during the first year of modi rule arun jaitley the finance minister had introduced the first budget of the modi government this needs to be analysed this budget on the one hand has spread the red carpet to the big corporates and on the other effected severe cuts in the social sector which was meant for the amelioration of the poor this budget had not extended any benefits to the poor this could as well be described as the budget carrying the seal of modi brand on it to conclude this third stage we shall set down hereunder the achievements of the modi government during the first year of its rule during his maiden speech in lok sabha prime minister modi had said the 1200 years of the history of slavery has placed indians in a state of slavery in the normal discourse 200 years of british rule is referred to as slavery under british imperialism but modi s reference to 1200 years of slavery relates it back to the muslim rule thus this statement made by modi in his maiden speech tantamounts to hinduisation of history we see modi s hidden agenda revealed in this maiden address the reforms undertaken by modi government during the first year are 100 percent fdi in defence sector opening out railways for privatisation prime minister modi convened a meeting of all the principal secretaries to the govt and instructed them as follows if you find any hurdle in your department directly contact me and dispose off the files this reveals that modi was converting the cabinet system into the american presidential system where the president rules the nation through the secretaries within two days of assuming office of prime ministership modi appointed nipendra mishra as pm s principal secretary thus satisfying the comprador capitalists the gift modi gave to the people of india for giving bjp a clear majority in the lok sabha is enhancing the railway fare by 142 percent and thus breaking the back of the common man modi government was described by the congress as the u turn government within six months of assuming office modi govt had once in every week had reversed its own policies to adopt the policies of the congress led upa a few of the examples are furnished hereunder when congress led upa attempted to introduce 40 percent fdi in the insurance sector the bjp had stalled the bill but now bjp led modi govt had introduced a bill to provide 49 percent fdi in insurance what a u turn congress had brought out a pamphlet exposing 25 u turns of modi govt in 6 months and thus called it a u turn government it is paradoxical that in a cabinet system of government headed by prime minister modi every cabinet minister has been converted into a rubber stamp and modi is running a defacto presidential form of government in modi government the rss has been functioning as an extra constitutional authority prime minister vajpayee had advised chief minister modi after godhra carnage follow the ideals of raj dharma now under modi s prime ministership sangh pariwar has given a call for ghar vapsi and resorting to conversions to hinduism prime minister had conferred bharatha ratna the highest national title to vajpayee under these circumstances can anyone expect vajpayee to advise prime minister modi to follow the ideals of rajadharma prime minister modi had decided to launch the completion of one year of modi rule at chandrabhan village near mathura the birth place of bjp ideologue pandit deen dayal upadhyaya and 60 000 had assembled in that village for this celebration modi declaraed in this celebration that his government is a pro poor government see the following instances of modi s rule can it be believed that in the first budget of the modi government a huge amount of rs 1 75 lakh crores was slashed from the expenditure for social sector projects which were meant for the poor none of the projects of modi government like jan dhan jeevan jyothi bima yojan suraksha bima yojan atal pension scheme which are declared to be meant for the poor are statutory benefits while the pro poor scheme of upa like mahatma gandhi rural employment guarantee scheme and food security scheme confer rights under the law they are legal rights enforceable in a court of law with such measures how could modi government be a pro poor government before concluding the analysis of prime minister modi s first year of achievements it is pertinent to peruse a very important statement made by one of the senior most leaders of bjp and the former deputy prime minister of india lal krishna advani he said there is no guarantee that emergency may not be clamped again forces that oppose democracy and the forces that can trample democratic forces are getting strengthened an emergency like situation is raising its head even as prime minister modi s rule was completing the first year the above statement of advani who had opposed emergency tooth and nail when prime minister smt indira gandhi had clamped emergency forty years back and which period was considered a black period had kicked up a controversy in political circles it may be recalled that advani was kept in custody by mrs gandhi during that period there were more than one lakh arrests fundamental rights were suspended many organisations were banned there was pre censorship of the media and a literal dictatorship was prevailing however it may be noted that with the backlash against emergency mrs gandhi was trounced despite this the undeclared emergency is preferred by narendra modi while advani did not name any person or any government in the statement he had made even a common man could read between the lines and say that advani was making an oblique reference to modi s rule when advani made this statement the infamously called lalit gate had taken place in the lalit modi scandal the names of sushma swaraj the central minister for foreign affairs and the son of vasundhara raje the chief minister of bjp ruled rajasthan were named in this background the opposition congress had demanded the resignations of sushma swaraj and vasundhara raje even while all these developments had occurred the prime minister narendra modi was observing a calculated silence without making any comment of these developments these certainly pointed to an impending emergency but undeclared in this regard the reaction of the congress spokesperson tom vadakan is pertinent he said about whom advani had made these observations is quite obvious whose govt is ruling who is the prime minister are these not known to him but the seasoned politician advani has not named the prime minister in his interview that is all however anyone who read the statement would know as to whom the statement points to in concluding this part of the analysis it can be said without fear of any contradiction that the prime minister s development slogans the mask of hindutva and the use of presidential type of administration had come to light even before the end of the first year of administration fourth stage the fourth stage of narendra modi s political travelogue refers to the second year of his administration between 26th may 2015 and 25th may 2016 while this period does not witness many administrative changes it does spell out certain very important developments a few of these are taken up for analysis hereunder one of the most important developments during this period is the judgment of the supreme court of india setting aside the national judicial appointments commission act as ultra vires the constitution of india this historic judgment was delivered by the constitution bench of the supreme court of india headed by justice j s khehar presiding over the five judge bench on 16th october 2015 it was a judgment by a majority of 4 1 and yet can be described as a historic judgment and 16th october 2015 could as well be described as a red letter day in the history of 65 years of the judiciary in independent india in this background it is necessary to have a glimpse of the said act and the judgment there of modi govt had succeeded in getting the national judicial appointments commission bill 2014 as also the 121st constitution amendment bill 2014 passed by both the houses of parliament and the necessary state legislatures and had obtained the assent of the president of india for the said bills the bill had become an act but was challenged before the supreme court when the five judge constitution bench headed by justice j s khehar was setup to decide on the constitutional validity of the said act this act gave primacy to the executive over the judiciary in the matter of appointments of judges the design of modi government was to subordinate the judiciary to the executive as it found that the judiciary was the major stumbling block in its design to perpetuate a fascist rule modi government s desire was to give a decent burial to the system of the collegium which was making judicial appointments it is in this background that the said act was challenged and the constitution bench had now delivered the majority judgment which declared that the national judicial appointments commission act 2014 was destructive of the independence of the judiciary and hence the system of the collegium which was authorized to make judicial appointments continued the validity to make judicial appointments in a way this judgment was a slap on the face of the modi government whose ulterior object in getting the national judicial appointments commission act 2014 was to take complete control of the judiciary and this historic judgment smashed the design of the government this judgment could as well be described as the saviour of judicial independence outlook an english weekly had published an interview of an octogenarian legal expert and a human rights activist richard v fak which laid bare the utterior motives of the modi government fak a professor emeritus of princeton university is the author of more than 40 books on law and is an internationally renowned human rights activist this interview was by pranav sharma of the weekly and reflects the opinions expressed by 137 educational experts and intellectuals in an appeal signed by them and addressed to the silicon valley 137 american experts expressed their deep concern over modi s design of digitalisation of india a few excerpts of this interview are narrated hereunder pranav sharma asked fak what is your main concern about modi s digital india movement fak said in reply digital india has the immense capacity to bring about social changes but at the same time there is the fear that it may be misused one cannot rule out the possibility of modi administration targeting the minority community or those who criticize its policies my opinion about modi government is that it does not have the attitude to tolerate its critics and it does not exhibit a friendly attitude towards them pranav sharma posed this question to fak modi as prime minister has won the mandate of the people he has the support of a sizeable section of the indian community what is your opinion about this fak replied it does not mean that any policy or programme which has become popular is a fair one we have observed that modi and his administration has provoked hindu nationalist feelings to gain the support of the hindu majority this is what is disturbing pranav sharma asked do you believe that the democratic institutions in india have weakened after modi become prime minister fak replied my belief is that the democratic institutions are getting weakened under modi s administration but there is no clarity that digital india which modi desires to introduce will increase transparency the background of modi as chief minister of gujarat and his one year s rule of india are creating a genuine concern and a feeling that the future of democratic institutions in india are in grave danger according to the view held by fak modi in a way may be speaking about majority but that does not weaken the opposition instead it puts pressure on the opposition if democracy has to develop in its strength differing voices without any sense of fear shall freely flow and without any kind of fear from the ruling government in the light of the opinions expressed by american experts voicing grave concern about impending dangers for the future of democracy and thus warning the democratic institutions are in peril due to the fanatic hindutva onslaught should not the indian intellectuals and the people of india get awakened to these dangers and get united to fight these fascist forces this is the million dollar question an understanding of the word and the deed the conflicting symbols of the cow and the lion the disastrous journey of the rabid communal forces from babri to dadri are essential to save indian democracy from peril at the out set a look into the path treaded by the hindutva forces from babri to dadri is necessary while babri saw the demolition of the masjid at ayodhya and its disastrous consequences the gujarat carnage of 2002 led not only to the massacre of more than 2000 muslims in gujarat but also destruction of properties of minorities worth more than 12 000 crore rupees and the flight of more than a lakh muslims from gujarat to save their lives and this is illustrative of the great magnitude of destruction and devastation done with the sole objective of spreading hindutva and establishing a hindu raj now we have dadri a village in the land of buddha an apostle of peace and non violence where one mohmad akhlak was brutally murdered and his son flogged almost to death but he miraculously survived on the plea that they had eaten beef the paradox is that while these sangh pariwar cadres were going about killing and plundering under the pretence of saving the cows prime minister modi was canvassing for the bjp candidates in the state of bihar and what he said when he broke his silence is worthy of analysis modi had said for india s progress communal harmony is essential the poor hindu must join hands with a poor muslim to fight against poverty what a duplicity what a rift between words and deeds talk development and do hindutva this was bjp s rajaneeti modi had selected the lion as the emblem for make in india the sangh pariwar chose the cow as its saviour now modi takes a ride on the lion on the one side and the cow on the other it is not riding on two horses but riding on two animals the cow and the lion remember the cow is lion s prey what a contradiction and what a paradox there is another question that arises is the lion the one in the forests or the circus lion domesticated by modi indian electorate alone shall decide on the future of such a ride is it for the welfare of the common indians a gomukha vyagra the two animal symbol the last episode in the fourth stage the second year of modi s rule this episode relates to the shedding of tears by the chief justice of india the supreme head of the judiciary in india before the prime minister of india the supreme head of the executive in india this is unprecedented but most unfortunate chief justice of india t s thakur shedding tears before the prime minister of india narendra modi at the conference of chief ministers and chief justices held on 24th april 2016 this is an unparalleled incident and had drawn the attention of the national and international media the cause for expression of the deep agony by the chief justice of india is the utter apathy of the modi government in not filling vacancies of judges on the one hand and on the other the growing pending of cases to himalayan heights what a tragedy even the tears of cji would not motivate the prime minister to action we will take a look at the factual situation relating to pendency of cases and the strength of the judiciary there are 38 68 lakh pending cases in 1987 the law commission made a recommendation and said that instead of 10 judges that are required for a population of 10 lakhs presently there is a need for 50 judges for that population this recommendation is in cold storage according to the chief justice of india there is a need for 50 000 judges instead of 20 000 this recommendation has not yet been acted on presently more than 48 3 percent of vacancies are there in the judges posts the government is not interested in filling up these vacancies as their design to take control of the judiciary failed miserably as the national judicial appointments commission act 2014 has been declared unconstitutional by the constitution bench of the supreme court of india with this analysis the fourth stage gets concluded fifth stage while the fifth stage is meant to enlist the achievements of prime minister modi during the third year of his rule this section commences with a review of seven hundred and twenty days of modi s rule to assess as to how far he has fulfilled the promises held out by him in the bjp election manifesto and in the speeches he delivered in the run up to the elections of 2014 modi had promised during his election campaign that he if elected to power would recover the entire black money of rs 15 lakh crores deposited by tax evaders in india in foreign banks and deposit rs 15 lakhs to the bank account of every indian immediately after his historic electoral victory modi declared a project to enable voluntary declaration of black money and this resulted in the declaration of rs 3770 crores which was only a pittance thus there is a world of difference between what is promised and what was achieved in the two years of governance modi had promised a corruption free india if he came to power but in the last two years of his rule a series of cases of corruption against those in power in bjp have sprung up a case of vyapam scam of several crores has been reported against madhya pradesh bjp chief minister shivaraj singh chavan rajasthan bjp chief minister vasundhara raje s son has been implicated in a scam along with lalit modi who had fled to england facing a massive scam there were several other scams reported against bjp ministers who are in power has not modi breached his promise of a corruption free bharath one of the most senior leaders of bjp had said that the clamping of emergency cannot be ruled out he had said an emergency like situation is already prevalent modi government had designed to demolish judicial independence by enacting the national judicial appointments commission act 2014 however the constitution bench of the supreme court had held that the said act was unconstitutional being violative of judicial independence modi s design to subjugate the judiciary to the executive had thus got frustrated the greatest achievement of modi in the last two years was to throw open the defence sector for foreign direct investments and to allow private capital to make in roads into railways and to open up 49 percent foreign investments in insurance while modi effectively played the role of the prime agent of the foreign capital and the big business in india it also effectively subjugated itself to neo imperialist interests of america playing role as a junior partner so far as the poor of india are concerned they were blessed with mouthful of promises and a flood of assurances with few of them being realized indeed the poor in india were left in the lurch with this concise review of modi s seven hundred and twenty days of rule a survey of the achievements of prime minister modi during the third year of his rule is presented hereunder the first episode relates to the address delivered by the prime minister from the red fort on the independence day this was the third time prime minister modi was addressing the nation from the red fort in delhi the chief justice of india was highly disappointed at this address as p m had not made even a formal mention of the vacancies in the judiciary and the steps envisaged by the government to address this problem having been disgusted at this callous unconcern of the prime minister the chief justice of india made certain statements which are extracted here during the british days a case took ten years to get disposed now even after a hundred years we are unable to dispose a case that is the reason why i am again and again requesting the government to pay attention to the filling up of vacancies of judges in india for the 24 high courts we have 1076 sanctioned posts of judges among these sanctioned posts 478 posts are remaining vacant hence 48 3 percent posts are remaining unfilled this year our collegium has recommended 74 persons for filling up the posts of judges and the government has put it in cold storage the entire edifice of the judiciary is collapsing in the various high courts there are 40 lakh cases pending disposal to completely dispose of one appeal the client would feel that he has undergone life imprisonment the government has not been approving the proposals regarding appointments and transfers sent by the collegium a doubt arises whether the central government desires to bring the entire judiciary to a grinding halt if such a situation arises and if the government tries to push the judiciary to a corner then it would become inevitable to the judiciary to act judicially the chief justice of india the apex judicial functionary of the judiciary in india has several times made several types of efforts including shedding tears in the presence of the prime minister and urged for filling up of vacancies but the prime minister narendra modi till date had not responded to the cji s call how insensible during this period one of the important steps taken by prime minister modi is the declaration of demonetization on 8th november 2016 by which the high denomination notes of the value of rs 500 and rs 1000 were declared withdrawn this sent a shock wave throughout the nation it was stated that this demonetization had three fold purposes they were an attack on black money a drive against fake notes and an attack on terrorists who were using black money and fake notes while a section welcomed this step as laudable another section dubbed it as a great scam it is pertinent to record a few of these observations mamata banerjee chief minister of west bengal reacting to demonetization gave a call to all non bjp parties including the cpi m to get united to fight against the modi government and get this declaration withdrawn she said that prime minister modi s declaration can be described as black government s black policy and is a policy of the anti people anti poor government this measure is like an emergency situation and is like an armed attack against the opposition the chief minister of delhi arvind kejrival said the act of demonetization of the central government is a mega scam according to swaminathan of swamionics history reveals that black money is only two percent of the whole black money major part of black money is transparent in the form of gold immoveable property and in investments and another part of black money is deposited in foreign banks the various reactions reveal the stark reality that it is only an illusion that demonetization would eradicate the entire black money there is also the likelihood of demonetization making way for new forms of black money what is tragic is that the poor the working and the middle classes while standing in long que s to get their own money became victims of this exercise and it is estimated that nearly a hundred of them had lost their lives while standing in the ques west bengal chief minister mamata banarjee s following remark is sharp and revealing she had said prime minister modi while in a way is hitler on the other way is mohamed bin tughlaq in the interests of india prime minister modi shall have to be defeated after citing another event the fifth stage would be concluded prime minister narendra modi by appointing yogi adityanath as the chief minister of uttar pradesh has revealed that the object of bjp is the establishment of hindu raj by this decision it can be said that the bjp had torn its veil of development asunder and exposed its real face a conclusion of the fifth stage is thus drawn sixth stage the sixth stage of the ascent of modi and his governance covers the fourth year of his rule in india one of the major steps in the field of finance undertaken by prime minister modi was the ushering in of the g s t a concise presentation of this measure is made hereunder this presentation is an analysis based on the views expressed by the renowned scholar anand teltumbe this presentation consists of two parts one is historical and the other political from the historical point of view it is found that prime minister accords g s t the same status as the independence day thus the launching of g s t was scheduled to be observed in the central hall of parliament during the midnight of 1st july 2017 it needs to be recalled that only three events were held in the central hall of parliament the first was the declaration of independence on the midnight of 15th august 1947 and the second event was that of the golden jubilee of indian independence which was held at midnight in the central parliamentary hall another dimension of this historic event cannot be overlooked as it is also part of history the congress led central govt had tried to introduce gst thrice in the parliament and on all the three occasions it was opposed by the bjp on the one hand and the then chief minister of gujarat narendra modi on the other paradoxically when the bjp led nda came to power at the centre the bjp and more so the prime minister narendra modi sponsored the introduction of gst is this not a bundle of contradictions nextly the political dimension of gst be analysed what is needed to be noted is that behind the declaration one nation one market one tax the hidden agenda of bjp and sangh pariwar the hindu nation is the secret this is analogous to the slogan one people one nation one leader given by one of world s most notorious fascist s and dictator adolf hitler this has another political dimension which is also very important another hidden agenda of gst is to convert a formal federal structure into an unitary one the paradoxical part of the gst is that the states have surrendered their right to tax as incorporated in the state list of the constitution of india the gst has yet another dimension this method of taxation helped more the corporates the big business and big capitalists and the foreign capitalists the small industrialists the small businessmen will get looted under this system of taxation further the poor the depressed and the suppressed classes get their back broken under this system of taxation the other episode that needs to be analysed as part of the fourth year of modi s rule is the issue relating to freedom of speech and expression let us examine this aspect two important happenings need to be mentioned here the first the cbi raid on the renowned t v news channel n d t v and the other is the censorship of a documentary on the nobel laureate amartya sen let us probe into these incidents n d t v had taken a loan from a private bank the ndt v and the said bank entered into a private settlement on the modus of clearance of the loan and on this basis the ndtv cleared the loan there was neither a complaint nor any dispute raised by the said bank after the above mentioned settlement despite this the central government had suo motto ordered a cbi investigation into this deal through this raid the modi government had given a warning to the entire media would you listen to what we say or else do you want us to put the noose around your neck this was the secret message of the modi government it may be recalled that mrs gandhi as prime minister of india during the emergency had clamped pre censorship and restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression this declaration was made under the constitution of india but prime minister modi had imposed restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression and on the media without officially declaring the emergency as was done by mrs gandhi thus an undeclared emergency is in vogue under modi s rule let us examine the episode relating to the documentary on amartya sen the producer of this documentary suman ghosh had included an interview with amartya sen in this documentary in this interview amartya sen had used the words cow gujarat hindu india hindutva etc the censor board directed the producer to cut these words from the interview the producer contended that these words constituted the soul of the interview and if cut the interview would lose its soul itself and refused to censor the documentary as directed by the censor board the permission for the release of the documentary was refused these episodes amply illustrate as to how prime minister modi s rule had strangulated the people of the country from being free citizens enjoying the fundamental rights of speech and expression as declared under the constitution of india democracy had found a new definition under modi s rule the classical definition of the people for the people and by the people had been given a go by and the following definition being practiced come to power by any means and anyhow having come to power retain it by any means and anyhow and when the official term of power is over regain power by any means and anyhow this had come to be the new definition and a new norm for democracy under prime minister modi s rule by now all ruling parties had come to adopt this new norm seventh stage the seventh and the last stage of prime minister modi s rule covered under this section covers a few of the events during the fifth year of modi s rule the national statistics commission had published the gdp back series this covered the three periods of rule in india ie that of atal bihari vajpayee dr manmohan singh and narendra modi and has given a comparative analysis these statistics are revealing and deserve to be studied 1999 to 2004 covered the period of bjp s prime minister atal bihari vajpayee during these five years gdp s average grwoth rate yearly record was 5 82 percent after this 2004 05 to 2013 14 the ten years the congress led upa under prime minister dr manmohan singh was in power during this period the average yearly gdp growth rate was 8 12 percent this was followed by the period 2014 to 2018 bjp led nda rule under the prime ministership of narendra modi during these four years the average yearly gdp was 7 22 percent these statistics officially released by the national statistics commission on a comparison established that the period of ten years under congress led upa government with dr manmohan singh as prime minister showed the highest gdp further during these ten years of singh s rule the gdp average had crossed two times the 10 annual average another measure of economic development of the country is gross fixed capital formation this phenomenon was also comparatively studied by the commission and the results are reported as follows during prime minister vajpayee s period the above achievement was 7 2 percent and during prime minister modi s rule the above achievement was 6 4 percent while during dr manmohan singh s rule of the congress it was 10 2 percent these statistics evidence that during the upa rule under congress leadership with dr manmohan singh as prime minister economic development capital investment and job creation were far better than under the bjp rule of both vajpayee and modi these statistics are revealing and establishing that economic growth was far superior under the congress led upa rule when compared to the bjp led nda rule revealing facts are you aware of these facts upa government during its rule spent rs 2048 crores on advertisements modi led nda during 2014 to 2018 has spent rs 4880 crores on advertisements this evidences that the modi led nda has spent more than twice what the congress led upa had spent this information was furnished by rajavardhan rathod minister of state for information in the modi cabinet under adolf hitler the man in charge of propaganda was goebbels who believed that a falsehood repeated a hundred times sounds more true than the truth itself obviously the expenditure on propagating falsehood shall have to far exceed what is spent on telling the truth what a paradox contradictions the contradictions under modi s rule need to be studied and the study in contrast of the hunger index and the growth of riches of the super rich in india is presented hereunder the hunger index published by the united nations reveals that the extent of hunger is continually on the rise of every nine persons in the world there is one person who is struck with hunger while this is the global position let us study the position of hunger in india recently global hunger index has been published according to this report of the 119 nations india is at the 103rd place among the nations labeled as nations suffering from severe hunger india is listed this is indeed tragic let us see the position occupied by our neighbouring countries china 25th place nepal 72nd place myanmar 68th place sri lanka 67th place thus we are far behind all these neighbours perhaps the only solace we can draw is that while pakistan s place is 106th india s place is 103rd could this be a real solace the tragic part is that india which occupied the 100th place in 2017 has slided down to 103rd place in 2018 this shows that those suffering from hunger and malnutrition have been on the increase now in 2018 when compared to 2017 could this be called the contribution of modi s government to the amelioration of the poor let us now probe into the position of the rich and the super rich in india according to the report of the world organization 51 5 percent of the wealth in india is under the control of the 1 percent rich this is according to the statistics available for 2018 compare this with the statistics of 2017 and we find that during this year 45 10 percent of the wealth of india was controlled by 1 percent rich in india this evidences that the 1 percent rich who controlled 45 10 percent of the wealth in 2017 have increased their wealth to 51 5 percent in 2018 so the number and strength of super rich in india had increased from 2017 to 2018 in the last 12 months the strength of the millionaires had increased by 2 300 hence the strength of the millionaires in india had increased to 3 43 lakhs the wealth of the millionaires now is rs 440 lakh crores at the same time the 91 percent of the others in india only possessed less than rs 7 lakh crores the millionaires in india occupy the 6th place among the millionaires of the world india occupied its place next only to america china germany britain and japan another interesting revelation is that a report published on 22nd october 2018 by the income tax department stated that the proportion of crorepaties had increased in the last three years and has touched 68 percent increase similarly in the last three years those corporaties joint families and institutions earning more than a crore which recorded 88 948 in 2014 15 has increased to 1 40 139 during 2017 18 this records a 60 percent increase these statistics of the hungry on the one hand and super rich on the other establish an incontrovertible truth that during the last four years of modi s rule there has been a phenomenal increase in the number of children reeling under hunger starvation and malnutrition as the global hunger index indicates in contrast it is also found that there has also been an astronomical growth of the rich and the super rich under the last four years of modi s rule do we need any proof to show for whom prime minister modi s rule stands thus the seven stages of prime

this article is more than 5 years old 2019 bloomberg finance lp zero increases for fed funds in 2019 and no more sales of bonds after september that s the latest monetary policy guidance from the us federal reserve it ends the tightening cycle that saw the first rate increase in december 2015 but really began in may 2013 when then chairman ben bernanke ended quantitative easing qe was the fed policy of buying bonds to push down market interest rates and by the post 2008 financial crisis peak the central bank held 4 5 trillion on its balance sheet the plan now is to cut that to 3 5 trillion by the end of september and then hold steady while refinancing maturing mortgage backed securities with us treasury paper the total fed funds increase was 2 25 percentage points that compares to 4 25 points for june 2004 2006 and is the lowest for a tightening cycle in the post world war ii era it s also by far the longest duration period of tightening starting from the reversal of qe chairman jerome powell couched the move as aligning policy with the fed s inflation target of 2 percent annualized but the change will leave balance sheet bonds at 17 percent of us gdp versus just 6 percent in june 2006 at the end of the previous tightening cycle that raises questions about how the central bank will be able to fight a real economic slump fortunately only two of the 10 factors in our forecasting model currently point to a recession in 2019 and one of those federal reserve policy will reverse shortly unless the central bank changes course again with no recession the bull market in stocks won t end anytime soon and investors will be best advised to use the dips to build positions in strong companies rather than to run for the hills those who took advantage of the market s december holiday season lows are already much wealthier for the effort the s p 500 is still about three percentage points below its late september 2018 high but is up 24 percent from its low point concerns about global growth triggered that selloff emerging evidence that slowing even in china won t be as bad as feared inspired the recovery along with generally solid calendar fourth quarter 2018 earnings the fed s news this week has obviously spurred buying and we see multiple potential catalysts for more gains well into the summer those include a prospective us china trade deal muddling through brexit and another solid earnings reporting season that kicks off in less than a month but so long as our forecasting model says no recession our focus will be on the health and growth of companies underlying businesses whether they pay dividends or not there s persistent conventional wisdom that sectors like utilities and reits are bond substitutes and by that reasoning they should especially benefit from the end of this tightening cycle i ll go along with that in one very important respect mainly these sectors are major sellers of bonds both to fund new capital spending and to refinance existing debt the fed s announcement this week has pushed the 10 year treasury note yield to its lowest level since the beginning of 2018 since bonds issued by utilities reits and other dividend payers are benchmarked to treasurys this is a potential major opportunity for companies to issue bonds at lower rates cutting interest costs and thereby boosting earnings there s potentially an even bigger opportunity for the handful of investment grade energy midstream companies like enterprise products partners epd and kinder morgan inc kmi to do the same but it s unlikely to extend to borrowers with sub investment grade ratings in fact the going could get tougher if investors perceive the fed s policy change as a tacit warning of an impending recession what s patently false however is the persistent popular narrative that dividend paying stocks prices always follow interest rates and fed policy up and down the dow jones utility average for example traded around 550 when fed funds increased for the first time in december 2015 just before this week s zero increases announcement it hit a new all time high around 780 the djua did even better from june 2004 to june 2006 returning nearly 60 percent during both tightening cycles utilities benefitted from a strengthening economy just like the rest of the stock market which the fed was responding to by raising rates and earnings and growth will continue to set their course going forward even with the fed standing pat the fed s considerable influence on the economy means it can certainly affect these factors and all else equal what it announced this week is bullish for stocks and bonds but make no mistake there is no lock step relationship between fed policy and investor returns from dividend paying stocks need more proof the djua managed double digit total returns in 2009 and 2013 both years when the fed raised rates and the 10 year treasury note yield rose by more than 70 percent conversely even with dividends utilities were underwater by nearly 30 percent in 2008 a year of frantic fed rate cutting and a halving of benchmark rates at the end of the day dividend stocks behave like other stocks they re not bond followers or bond alternatives returns track prospects for companies health and growth whether the fed is raising rates or cutting them that s what to focus on now more than ever
what would the founding fathers make of a young congresswoman of puerto rican descent and modest means calling for a sweeping overhaul of our nation s political infrastructure first remember that alexandria ocasio cortez s plan is inspired by a similar overhaul successfully enacted into law by a rich old white guy yes we ve come a long way since the 1930s the other key difference between franklin roosevelt s new deal and this updated one is that whereas for ocasio cortez the impetus is global ecological collapse back then it was mass unemployment following a stock market crash noteworthy too is how the 2008 financial meltdown in many ways more catastrophic even than the one in 1929 was managed so as not to result in another great depression the fix was a taxpayer funded bailout paired with the few remaining new deal protections from financial overreach left after decades of bank deregulation the 2008 crisis wouldn t have happened at all if fdr s glass steagall act had not been repealed by the clinton administration it is ironic that socialist intervention in the form of that bailout kicked the can down the road nothing fundamentally changed the issues underlying the mortgage crisis were not resolved or even addressed too big to fail banks are bigger than ever and increasingly interdependent so are many other sectors of our economy and as wealth concentrates the majority of americans are increasingly left behind it has gotten to the point where the new york times in a recent piece about the wealth gap defined as upper middle class anyone in the top 10 percent of earners it used to be the upper third didn t it in truth only the upper 1 percent of americans with stock portfolios are benefiting from rising gdp and low unemployment most people s income hasn t budged since the 1970s when the relatively low cost of living meant a family could still survive on one paycheck the day of reckoning has arrived it is called appropriately i think the green new deal it begins with values which is also appropriate this is how the founders crafted their vision for america the declaration of independence set forth the why and the constitution hammered out through intense negotiation created the how the system of checks and balances seemed foolproof and set the course for steady improvement in america s quality of life unfortunately it was not able to withstand globalization s promise of both free and fair trade the founders central fear was international pressure to conform to the values of other nations mainly the european powers whose practice of imperialism as opposed to high minded talk of manifest destiny most of the founders deplored that fear became real in the reagan era with the ascendancy of laissez faire capitalism the founders vision of a democratic oasis of fairness and equality was eventually eroded by a corporate sponsored propaganda campaign that convinced most americans that less is more when it comes to government the green new deal challenges americans all americans to link arms and take government back young people face a terrifying future only they understand that climate change is not an economic opportunity but a crisis more dire than pearl harbor and that just as world war ii was managed by fdr and not a handful of ceos in some private resort in davos only government can fix this to patronizing comments by the likes of house speaker nancy pelosi young advocates of the green new deal have responded with reasoned insights in a new york times op ed the millennial jedediah brittoin purdy author of after nature a politics for the anthropocene wrote this what has taken liberal critics aback is that the green new deal strays so far from the traditional environmental emphasis on controlling pollution which the carbon tax aims to do and tries to solve the problems of economic inequality poverty and even corporate concentration there s an antimonopoly clause the young minds behind the green new deal know full well that as britton purdy writes entrist proposals will concentrate on promoting investment in new technologies with profits going pharma style to private researchers and manufacturers he goes on to educate his elders with memory problems on the american history they lived and he only read about curiously the idea that environmental policy could ever be separated from the larger economic order or from fights over fairness is recent a product of an unusually technocratic period in american politics the old attitude toward environmental policy was alive and well as recently as 1970 on both sides of the aisle he adds arguing for the clean air act on earth day 1970 senator edmund muskie democrat of maine and the law s lead drafter insisted that man s environment included the shape of the communities in which he lives and that the only kind of society that has a chance was a society that will not tolerate slums for some and decent houses for others rats for some and playgrounds for others clean air for some and filth for others what s changed isn t just our climate but our national priorities by conflating socialism with joe stalin the right succeeded in scaring americans into thinking their democratically elected government with its elaborate checks and balances was somehow not just hopelessly inefficient at decisionmaking true but ruthlessly efficient at destroying freedom the founders would have been appalled their own idealism was if anything more quixotic and impractical than the moonshot that alexandria ocasio cortez invokes when she compares her plan with the can do america that was still awed by supersonic jets and yet undaunted by the notion of putting a man on the moon after all the founders had just whipped the mightiest military force in history among them the federalist alexander hamilton would be especially pleased to see that his beloved federal government was still powerful enough 200 years on to mobilize around a threat to the common good hamilton may have been an elitist but he was also a staunch democrat who believed in fairness and would not have approved of a system as rigged in favor of the rich as the global economy is in 2019 historians generally agree that hamilton would not only have deplored the serial laissez faire administrations of presidents warren g harding calvin coolidge and herbert hoover in the 1920s but vigorously applauded fdr s moves to strengthen the banking system that hamilton himself had invented all the founders would have seen that the current crisis is about preserving u s values from the same influences that threatened their new nation cynicism and greed as for land stewardship thomas jefferson adopted regenerative practices at monticello after learning from his own mistakes as a farmer he would have loved fdr s subsistence homesteading act because it helped farmers who had unwittingly exhausted the soil arguably a minor offense compared to knowingly polluting it with chemicals toxic to soil microbes and other wildlife the act did what the green new deal will do if its vision becomes law government subsidies enabled small scale farmers to learn from their mistakes adopt more eco friendly practices and make the dust bowl productive again this turnaround was accomplished long before the green revolution forced small scale farmers off the land john steinbeck s the grapes of wrath tells how the okies were demonized by fellow american citizens when they migrated to california in the 30s reminding us of yet another inconvenient truth about american history and basic human nature bigotry can almost always be traced to the survival instinct and its corollary in humans fear of poverty it isn t dark skin that causes prejudice but its negative associations fear of poverty is why hoover brutally dismantled an encampment of mostly white veterans the bonus army who were only trying to collect back wages for serving in world war i then as now the poor were branded as lazy and shiftless no matter who they were there is one difference people were kinder to the okies and the hobos and the refugees from the bonus encampment and hoovervilles because they knew that there but for the grace of god go i they also knew the crisis would pass they had confidence in fdr climate change is different it is unprecedented in human history fear of losing advantage has gripped the elites of both parties this is why they are loath to surrender power to young idealists but those agitating for a green new deal have their own truth they know that the measured approach the elites pretend to believe in is in fact a shibboleth by opposing a risky to them fight on all fronts the elites are simply hedging their bets they have built up defenses against any ideology other than dog eat dog and now they are willing to sacrifice not just the common good but a sizable portion perhaps the majority of their fellow human beings this is the greatest unfairness of all unless the green new deal is embraced only the rich will have the means to place a bet ordinary working americans must win this fight it s not about the survival of the species as the elites would have us believe though they know otherwise homo sapiens is as resilient as the cockroach it s about who will survive and why they will survive and how that story will be told for generations to come bonnie blodgett of st paul specializes in environmental topics she s at bonnieblodgett gmail com
venezuela collapse looting hunger blackouts december 17 2018 planet money podcast bonus indicator the measure of a tragedy it s hard to understand how bad a country is doing with figures like inflation rate unemployment rate and their minimum wage a better way to understand a nation s living standards is how many calories a person could afford to buy a day earning a minimum wage if they spent all of their money on food that is the food with the most calories which in venezuela has sometimes been pasta or flour and today is the yucca plant venezuelans could by 57 000 calories in 2012 with one day s wages and several dozen eggs but today a person can afford just 900 calories or 2 eggs it would take a venezuelan 6 weeks to be able to afford one big mac earning minimum wage since the average person needs 2 000 calories a day as well as calories to feed their family and also housing clothing medicine and so on it s not surprising that the average venezuelan lost 24 pounds last year and that venezuela probably has the highest murder rate in the world the result is that at least 10 of venezuelans have emigrated nearly 3 million people if that many proportionally left the u s we d have 30 million people fleeing to canada and mexico and elsewhere july 16 2018 keith johnson how venezuela struck it poor foreignpolicy com venezuela s murder rate meanwhile now surpasses that of honduras and el salvador which formerly had the world s highest levels according to the venezuelan violence observatory blackouts are a near daily occurrence and many people live without running water according to media reports schoolchildren and oil workers have begun passing out from hunger and sick venezuelans have scoured veterinary offices for medicine malaria measles and diphtheria have returned with a vengeance and the millions of venezuelans fleeing the country more than 4 million according to the international crisis group are spreading the diseases across the region as well as straining resources and goodwill thanks to their geology venezuela s oil fields have enormous decline rates meaning the country needs to spend more heavily than other petrostates just to keep production steady 2017 10 22 oil quality issues could bankrupt venezuela the next few weeks for venezuela will be crucial as it struggles to meet a huge stack of debt payments reports that the nation s oil production is experiencing deteriorating quality raises a new cause for concern for the crumbling south american nation reuters reported that its oil shipments are soiled with high levels of water salt or metals that can cause problems for refineries which has led to 200 million in cancellations of oil contracts making venezuela even less able to make debt payments since oil is the only source of revenue barely keeping the nation afloat many experienced oil workers have fled the country to find food and escape violence because of these problems and trump imposed sanctions u s imports have dropped from roughly 700 000 barrels per day to 250 000 bpd 2017 5 2 venezuela is heading for a soviet style collapse a few lessons from the last time an oil economy crashed catastrophically 2017

left of inventory amid rampant inflation despair and violence is taking over venezuela the economic crisis sweeping the nation means people have to withstand widespread shortages of staple products medicine and food so when the maduro administration began rationing electricity this week leaving entire cities in the dark for up to 4 hours every day discontent gave way to social unrest on april 26 people took to the streets in three venezuelan states looting stores to find food maracaibo in the western state of zulia is the epicenter of thefts on tuesday alone venezuelans raided pharmacies shopping malls supermarkets and even trucks with food in seven different areas of the city although at least nine people were arrested and 2 000 security officers were deployed in the state zulia s secretary of government giovanny villalobos asked citizens not to leave their homes there are violent people out there that can harm you he warned in caracas the venezuelan capital citizens reported looting in at least three areas of the city twitter users reported that thefts occurred throughout the night in the industrial zone of la california campo rico and buena vista the same happened in carabobo a state in central venezuela supermarkets employees from valencia told the panam post that besides no longer receiving the same amount of food as before they must deal with angry venezuelans who come to the stores only to find out there s little to buy purchases in supermarkets are rationed through a fingerprint system that does not allow venezuelans to acquire the same regulated food for two weeks due to the country s mangled economy millions must stand in long lines for hours just to purchase basic products which many resell for extra income as the country s minimum wage is far from enough to cover a family s needs on wednesday the venezuelan chamber of food cavidea said in a statement that most companies only have 15 days worth of stocked food according to the union the production of food will continue to dwindle because raw materials as well as local and foreign inputs are depleted in the statement cavidea reported that they are 300 days overdue on payments to suppliers and it s been 200 days since the national government last authorized the purchase of dollars under the foreign currency control system the latest survey of living conditions encovi showed that more than 3 million venezuelans eat only twice a day or less the rampart inflation and low wages make it increasingly more difficult for people to afford food fruits and vegetables have disappeared from shopping lists what you buy is what fills your stomach more 40 percent of the basic groceries is made up of corn flour rice pasta and fat but not even that incomplete diet venezuelans can live on because those food products are hard to come by since their prices are controlled by the government they are scarce and more people demand them the survey also notes the rise of diseases such as gastritis with an increase of 25 percent in 2015 followed by poisoning 24 11 percent parasites 17 86 percent and bacteria 10 71 percent the results of this study are consistent with the testimony of venezuelan women who told the panam post that because everything is so expensive that they prefer to eat twice a day and leave lunch for their children that way they can make do with the little portions they can afford energyskeptic com

by mises by ryan mcmaken well at least they re now being honest about it a headline this week in the guardian reads ending climate change requires the end of capitalism have we got the stomach for it the article by phil mcduff goes on the discuss the green new deal currently being peddled in the us congress and declares a radical turn toward socialism is really at the heart of saving the planet from climate change the radical economics isn t a hidden clause but a headline feature climate change is the result of our current economic and industrial system gnd style proposals marry sweeping environmental policy changes with broader socialist reforms because the level of disruption required to keep us at a temperature anywhere below absolutely catastrophic is fundamentally on a deep structural level incompatible with the status quo the status quo we have now is a form of capitalism that is highly regulated by states manipulated by immensely powerful central banks and distorted by global ngos like the world bank nevertheless this system contains enough of a semblance of market based freedom that many leftwing ideologues regard it as a type of radical laissez faire capitalism marked by unrestrained and fossil fuel powered consumption not surprisingly they think this system must be abolished unfortunately for the billions of human beings who have benefited from what market freedom exists the new green socialist global state imagined by mcduff will undo decades of gains against grinding poverty gains enjoyed by the world s most at risk and poorest populations the decline of poverty and its effects in the developing world quality of life indicators have been consistently moving upward in recent decades global life expectancy is increasing especially in the poorest parts of the world child mortality is going down malnourishment is down access to clean water and sanitation is increasing literacy is increasing extreme poverty is rapidly declining access to electricity has grown the biggest gains tend to be in africa and south asia where the world s worst poverty has been historically found moreover we have yet to observe evidence that these trends will be reversed due to climate change this doesn t stop advocates for climate change socialism like mcduff from predicting disaster indeed in a july 2018 article mcduff predicts the effects of climate change will be so disastrous that not even oil companies will benefit from their rapacious fossil fuel mongering hazy disaster metrics but what exactly will this global disaster look like mcduff can point to no details or examples he can only predict the coming disasters will be measured in the lives lost the homes flooded the farms wasted away to drought yet the observed trends suggest this simply isn t happening moreover mcduff can t even point to rising deaths from natural disasters which we are so often told are the chief currency of the coming climate apocalypse in reality deaths from climate caused natural disasters have gone into steep decline this is why efforts to predict coming natural disaster fueled doom rely on dollar amounts and property damage which naturally grow over time as homes and machines become more complex and more expensive but any growth in human casualties simply can t be found and this is largely a byproduct of the wealth surpluses fueled by what moderate amounts of market freedom we have thanks to centuries of capital accumulation in market societies even ordinary people increasingly have access to better medical care infrastructure and disaster aid undreamed of in previous generations do what we say or face total and utter extinction so what proponents of carbon taxes and climate regulation will say sure the standard of living may decline but what s that compared to total global destruction this sort of hyperbolic language isn t an exaggeration on my part advocates for climate change regulations routinely rely on this sort of language precisely because they know the cost of implementing their policies comes at a very high cost thus the choice between their policy and alternatives must be framed as a choice between climate socialism or total extinction indeed when we examine the proposals in more detail such as october s report released by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc we find that the costs of implementation are immense after all the fundamental premise behind most climate change prevention schemes is to regulate energy production reduce access to cheaper forms of energy and then replace part of that lost capacity with subsidized new forms of green energy these subsidies require pulling wealth out of the productive economy and funneling it into special government favored green industries which will receive subsidies after the state bureaucracy takes its cut of course the more expensive products offered by these industries would not have been purchased without the subsidies and without the coercive regulations designed to reduce choice in energy consumption we re told this sort of extensive state control of one of the economy s most fundamental resources i e energy must happen because the only alternative is the total destruction of planet earth one does not need to be some sort of hard core laissez faire libertarian to see the problem even economist william nordhaus who has been hailed as a champion of climate change policies found that recent carbon tax and regulatory schemes were so costly that it would be better to do nothing it s also important to remember these costs are not mere aggregate numbers on a spreadsheet somewhere declaring war on rising standards of living the effects of these climate control schemes would come down hardest on people in the poorer parts of the world energy consumption is high in the rich world but the demand for growing access to electricity personal transportation and heating and cooling technologies are highest in the developing world access to these technologies will be increasingly important as climate change occurs people the world over will need heating and air conditioning they ll need water filtration technology they ll need better insulated homes they ll need appliances that improve sanitation and free human beings to engage in higher productivity labor but the new green socialism is an immense obstacle to all of this moreover people in the developing world are still in the process of gaining access to labor saving and life changing machines like washing machines electric devices such as these improve daily life an improvement felt especially by women in ways modern westerners forgot about long ago yet manufacturing and powering machines such as these is costly and the more affordable energy is available the more people will gain access first world chauvinism this is why statistician hans rosling saw a fundamental conflict between well meaning first world activists and ordinary people in the developing world when speaking to environmentally conscious audiences rosling noted many in the audience insisted that no everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines for these activists the imperative of lowering energy usage simply demands it but pointing to a photo of a low income women slaving over a wash basin rosling asks how can we tell this woman that she isn t going to have a washing machine it s a good question and it s also a reminder that much of the talk over carbon taxes and climate regulations smack of first world chauvinism the rich world already has its cars and its washing machines sure a global climate scheme would reduce the wealth of people in the rich world but the impact in china india africa and south america where most live closer to subsistence levels would be far more devastating for many environmentally minded suburban upper middle class people in north america and europe this is just tough

turkish president tayyip erdogan said on sunday those in the finance sector who buy foreign currencies on the expectation that the lira will fall will pay a very heavy price adding the finance ministry is carrying out work on this the turkish lira tumbled more than 4 per cent against the us dollar on friday its biggest one day fall since a currency crisis took hold in august raising concerns that turks are buying more foreign cash as ties with washington deteriorate central bank data showed on thursday that forex deposits and funds including precious metals held by turkish locals hit a record high in the week to march 15 which economists said signalled a fall in confidence in the lira the lira stood at 5 7800 against the dollar at 2005 gmt in asian trade weakening from friday s close of 5 7625 speaking at a local election rally in istanbul mr erdogan said some people had begun provoking turkey and that they were attempting to make the lira decline against foreign currencies with their cooperators in turkey i am calling on those who engage in such activities on the eve of elections we know all of your identities we know what all of you are doing know this after the elections we will present you with a heavy bill he said turks will go to polls on march 31 for local elections in an interview with broadcaster tgrt haber later on sunday mr erdogan also said turkey would give a hard time to those in the international community behind what he called manipulative impositions in the fx market mr erdogan did not specify who his comments were aimed at but on saturday turkey s banking and market regulators said they had launched investigations into complaints that a jp morgan report had caused speculation in the istanbul bourse and hurt the reputation of banks a jp morgan spokesman for the region declined to comment on the investigations the report seen by reuters said it saw a high risk that the lira would decline after the local election recommending clients to go long on the us dollar such advice is typical of client notes from banks globally finance minister berat albayrak said on friday that speculators were talking down the turkish economy on social media and that the manipulation was similar to that he said took place during anti government protests in 2013 reuters
when janet nguyen first heard that gov tim walz s budget would give the university of minnesota far less than it requested this year the sophomore student deployed her six roommates they each called the governor s office to tell him to put up more money a first generation college student and campus government representative nguyen said she is personally worried about a potential tuition increase she believes that for some classmates it could determine whether they can stay in school nguyen and other student leaders at minnesota s public colleges and universities called walz s original budget plan in february a disappointment saying it continues a troublesome saga of lower state spending per student in higher education walz responded friday with a revised budget adding another 13 million for minnesota state and 12 million for the university of minnesota our families our students and our educators across minnesota convinced me that we needed to change this he said walz s budget now includes 26 percent of the additional 246 million that minnesota state asked for and 59 percent of the university of minnesota s requested funding boost of 87 million the schools still face another challenge as they turn to the legislature where senate and house leaders are drawing up their own spending plans when inflation is factored in the state s investment in the public institutions lags where it was pre recession and 20 years ago walz said friday he would like to see a tuition freeze but university of minnesota president eric kaler said that s not possible without more money from the state kaler said walz s budget increase takes some pressure off tuition but the u still would have to look to students for support he is also looking at the alternatives that means cuts that means diminution in compensation it could mean reducing staff and at the end of the day it would dramatically affect what students are able to get from the u in terms of advising support career advice counseling class availability he said the university of minnesota has been urging students staff and alumni to join an e mail and twitter campaign to get walz to change his budget and student government leaders from all five u campuses took the unusual step of passing the same resolution calling on the administration to spend more on their schools and keep them affordable the resolution which they sent to legislators and the governor noted that walz previously committed to once again having the state cover two thirds of the cost of attending a state college or university that s where we need to be said dennis olson commissioner of the state office of higher education he said administration is open to other ways to raise money to meet that threshold minnesota state students and faculty are also pushing for more inver hills community college instructor matt williams handed gov tim walz a fat stack of notecards from faculty at two year schools across the state during an event this month the handwritten messages stressed the importance of funding state colleges there is a lot of hope riding on governor walz and his leadership in the governor s residence said williams who is vice president of the minnesota state college faculty union he noted that as a candidate walz tapped into a national conversation about student debt and advocated for two years of free tuition williams called walz a former high school teacher a friend of education he added friends sometimes have to have tough conversations walz s revised budget reduces higher education spending in other areas it cuts 4 million from a new initiative to help adults re enroll in postsecondary education and reduces by 11 million the additional funding he proposed for tuition assistance grants meanwhile some public school students and faculty including williams have raised concerns about the grants benefiting students at private colleges thirty five percent of the total state grant money offered in 2018 went to students at state colleges and universities while 29 percent went to university of minnesota students and 36 percent went to students at private nonprofit or for profit schools according to office of higher education data the minnesota association of private college students sent walz a letter this month saying in his short time in office he has made tremendous efforts to support the grant program state grants work in concert with federal pell grants the federal program subsidizes more of the tuition for students from very low income families state grants also extend aid to families that make a bit more low income students have great barriers to college in terms of affordability but so do many middle income families minnesota private colleges president paul cerkvenik said the state sees a good return on the dollars it spends on private schools he said noting that they produce about 30 percent of the four year degrees granted each year in the state private colleges advocated for 92 million in new funding for state grants cerkvenik said like all budgetary requests he added there was an aspirational aspect to that in addition to his budget walz proposed a large infrastructure and public works borrowing package that would help maintain public colleges and universities campuses his proposal includes 300 million that would be divided evenly between minnesota state and the u schools might not be satisfied with walz s budget plan said olson of the state office of higher education but hopefully they re understanding that the projects they proposed that are highly needed on their campuses will be addressed through bonding senate leadership however has said this is not the year for such a large bonding bill frankie becerra president of the organization representing community and technical college students said students are trying to sway legislators instead of focusing on spending he said they have been talking to lawmakers about the importance of an educated workforce it s a message he also shared in a letter to walz on tuesday when he asked the governor to shift his budget to focus on the minnesota state system rather than putting a lot more money into state grants when there is a workforce shortage in many skilled jobs our state s economy cannot afford to create more barriers for these students in obtaining a degree becerra wrote nguyen said u students are also taking their stories to legislators en masse when we come in numbers i feel like we are taken more seriously she said and there s a lot of power in that

the u s treasury announced on friday that the federal government has spent 1 8 trillion since october 1 the start of fiscal year 2019 while tax receipts were only 1 3 trillion this leaves a deficit of a little over 500 billion it would have been only 489 billion except that in the month of february the irs began sending out refund checks and personal and business tax returns aren t due until april only 489 billion on an annual basis if nothing changes the federal government will ring up deficits of 1 2 trillion this fiscal year pushing the national debt to over 23 trillion by october as the new american reported last month the congressional budget office cbo estimated that in less than 10 years the national debt will be close to 36 trillion if nothing changes a lot of things can change in 10 years wars depressions and the green new deal for starters so readers should brace themselves for a national debt that exceeds human imagining but wait hasn t the federal government been running massive deficits for years with few lasting consequences the reasoning from common sense austrian school economic thinking goes like this deficits are financed either by borrowing or by printing new money digital new money since printing new currency is so passé when the newly borrowed or created money is spent by the government this pushes prices upwards reflecting the currency s loss of purchasing power great concerns are then voiced about runaway inflation followed by recession or depression but history seems to have gotten in the way the national debt first hit a trillion dollars in president reagan s first term and now clocks in at 22 trillion where is the runaway inflation where are the rising interest rates as investors and lenders demand more to protect themselves against loss of purchasing power and possible default today the government is able to borrow all it needs at three percent interest and what about japan the japanese government has been attempting to stimulate that country s moribund economy for decades that nation s national debt is now two and one half times the size of its annual economic output interest rates there declining from just over one percent in late 2018 to 0 2 percent in february where is the depression in japan its gross domestic product gdp is 5 trillion making it the third largest economy in the world behind china and the united states there is a new math to explain all of this and it has a name modern monetary theory or mmt the new american has taken pains to cover this here and here but simply put the new theory says that deficits don t matter as long as the government owns the printing press a professor of public policy and economics at an obscure university has been pushing mmt for years advising senator bernie sanders i vt and more recently representative alexandria ocasio cortez d n y that the government can spend without limit the only thing standing in the way says professor stephanie kelton of stony brook university is the will to spend it what we don t yet have is the final vital ingredient a critical mass of politicians prepared to unleash the enormous power of the public purse to save the planet in order to do that she says we must change the way we approach the federal budget we must give up our obsession with trying to pay for everything with new revenue or spending cuts mmt is getting some traction including from president trump s chief economic advisor larry kudlow i don t think good growth policies have to obsess necessarily about the budget deficit ben hunt runs a hedge fund and still clings to the now old fashioned idea that deficits do matter and that mmt is merely a new twist on the old alchemy that promised to turn lead into gold at its core modern monetary theory is an argument that would be wonderfully familiar to every sovereign since the invention of debt it is essentially the argument that significant sovereign debt is a good thing not a bad thing and that budget balancing efforts on a national scale do much more harm than good why because there s so much to do and so little time for the right minded sovereign because it is fundamentally unjust for the demands of private lenders to thwart the necessary ends of the sovereign and it is politically difficult to finance those ends through tax levies on a fickle citizenry mmt is the sovereign friendly justification for deficit spending without end it is time for those pushing mmt to re read the emperor s new clothes by han christian andersen image zimmytws via istock getty images plus an ivy league graduate and former investment advisor bob is a regular contributor to the new american writing primarily on economics and politics he can be reached at related articles cbo national debt to nearly double by 2029 modern monetary theory will pay for aoc s green new deal
not only did the federal reserve decide wednesday not to raise interest rates but it also indicated that no more hikes will be coming this year in a unanimous move that coincides with market expectations and demands the central bank s policymaking federal open market committee fomc took a sharp dovish turn from policy projections just three months earlier committee members had estimated in december that two rate hikes would be appropriate in 2019 after four increases in 2018 they also pointed to at least another one before ending a round of policy tightening that began in december 2015 however there now appears to be no likelihood of a hike unless conditions change significantly in its post meeting statement the fomc indicated it would remain patient before adopting any further increases the fed currently holds its benchmark funds rate in a range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent the rate is used as a key for determining interest on most adjustable rate consumer debt like credit cards and home equity loans the move came along with reduced expectations in gdp growth and inflation and a bump higher in the unemployment rate outlook for a central bank not so long ago intent on normalizing policy from its financial crisis era accommodation levels the developments at this week s meeting represent a striking change in direction the fed had held its benchmark rate near zero for seven years as it looked to stimulate the housing market and overall economic activity its low rate programs coincided with the longest bull market on record for stocks however chairman jerome powell and before him janet yellen has sought to get policy back to a place where the fed would have room to move in case of another pronounced economic downturn along with the historic lows in rate came three rounds of bond buying that helped provide liquidity to financial markets the program had pushed the fed s balance sheet to 4 5 trillion which it has sought to lower through a program that allowed proceeds from the bonds to roll off each month that roll off program also will conclude at the end of september a decision that also occurred in conjunction with financial market pressure on the fed to stop tightening policy at a time when economic uncertainty is running high fed officials now see economic gains of just 2 1 percent this year down from the 2 3 percent estimate in december and inflation reaching 1 8 percent a 0 1 percentage point reduction the unemployment rate for this year is now seen at 3 7 percent up 0 2 percentage points from december the lowered rate outlook was expressed in a sharp shift downward in the committee s dot plot a chart anonymously expressing the expectations of each of the fomc s 17 dot posting members in the previous quarter s projections just two members anticipated no hike that moved to 11 in the current plot december s meeting indicated 11 members believing two hikes would be appropriate that shifted to two this time in the statement explaining its decision the committee said economic activity has slowed even though the labor market remains strong despite february s weak 20 000 growth in nonfarm payrolls more specifically the statement said recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter a period during which gdp gains are expected to be modest inflation also has declined due largely to a drop in energy prices the statement added
why do they hate medicare for all investors in health insurance stock do very well they have been taking your premiums denying you as many drugs procedures and coverage as possible and then pocketing your payments in the form of dividends undeserved inflated million dollar salary to executives and bribes lobbying to government officials read politicians in other words they were legally killing americans for a profit medicare for all gets them out of the picture insurance companies now have major newspapers try to scare not only those who pay premiums but those who work in the fraudulent health insurance industrial complex recently the new york times published the article titled medicare for all would abolish private insurance there s no precedent in american history proponents want to sweep away our complex confusing profit driven mess of a health care system and start fresh with a single government run insurer that would cover everyone but doing away with an entire industry would also be profoundly disruptive the private health insurance business employs at least a half a million people covers about 250 million americans and generates roughly a trillion dollars in revenues its companies stocks are a staple of the mutual funds that make up millions of americans retirement savings such a change would shake the entire health care system which makes up a fifth of the united states economy as hospitals doctors nursing homes and pharmaceutical companies would have to adapt to a new set of rules most americans would have a new insurer the federal government and many would find the health insurance stocks in their retirement portfolios much less valuable yes destroying private health insurance for primary health care is what we want and have to do precisely is it disruptive of course it is but it is much less so than the millions who lose their lives go bankrupt or live in a state of permanent stress because of an immoral system that puts dollars for investors and executives over health care what could be more disruptive we must change the discourse to where the pain is and not to the few that will no longer profit from people getting sick we must not allow the minimization of the pain of the many if anyone doubts it is about money and not the well being of our citizens the concern in the article makes it clear after all not once did the article talk about the disruption to the daily lives of americans because of our health care system but it speaks to the fear of investors simply talk of medicare for all makes investors jittery shares of the large publicly held insurance companies including cigna humana and unitedhealth fell when representative pramila jayapal democrat of washington introduced her bill in late february but have largely rebounded the effective takeover of the health insurance industry in the united states would mean a huge hit to the companies stocks although the companies which have additional lines of business would most likely survive while the bills would give relief to insurance industry workers they would provide no such compensation for investors not surprisingly the insurance industry and many other health care industries vociferously oppose these plans and plan to spend heavily in fighting them medicare for all bills do take into account transitioning employees who would lose their jobs in the private insurance industry but why would they compensate investors did they not profit enough from the legal suborning of murder by health care denial and over pricing let s be clear in health care having a single payer medicare for all system is more efficient and much less expensive if you eliminate payments to shareholders who do nothing but collect a check comprised of your premiums the millions that executive make for doing little doctor s staff whose job is to fight with a myriad of insurance companies advertising cost duplicitous computer database cost and much more it is impossible that there is any other way period all discussions arguments and narratives to the contrary that a single payer medicare for all system is the most efficient and will cover everyone is an attempt to keep a for profit system to transfer your hard earned dollars to a few wealthy individuals they will try to scare you and make things more complicated than they are they are not accept no less than single payer medicare for all no private health insurance system can beat it lest we subsidize said system
african countries need additional 638b yearly to finance sdgs african countries will require an additional 638 billion yearly to attain the sustainable development goals sdgs the goals have 11 more years to go meanwhile some countries are falling into debt distress world leaders in 2015 adopted the 17 sdgs of the 2030 agenda for sustainable goals which came into force on january 1 2016 the new goals apply universally to countries and they are expected to mobilise to work towards ending all forms of poverty end inequalities tackle climate change provide good health services education for all zero hunger and provide clean water and sanitation for all among others it is also aimed at not leaving anyone behind but the need for african countries together to raise the estimated amount to fulfill the goals highlights the glaring gap that cannot be filled with the trends in public revenues savings and investment united nations economic commission for africa uneca executive secretary vera songwe said at the opening of the experts meeting at the 52nd session of the conference of african ministers of finance planning and economic development being held in marrakech kingdom of morocco from march 20 to 26 according to songwe the potential of africa is and has always been promising with a growing working age population abundant arable land and a multitude of other resources the continent has all the pre requisites for rapid economic transformation in the next decade she said she however pointed out that ensuring the availability of adequate public resources and quality investments to drive structural change requires responsive policies that promote fiscal sustainability optimise returns from economic activity and enable economies to fully participate in an increasingly interconnected and globalised world rising global demand increased commodity prices investment and private consumption have moderately driven the rebound from the poor growth results of about 2 5 per cent in 2016 to the current rate of 3 2 per cent however the medium term outlook of between three and four per cent for africa is insufficient to stimulate quality investments that will generate jobs and accelerate inclusive growth to do so africa needs to triple its current growth rate meaning investment must increase by between five to 10 per cent of gdp in order to achieve the sdgs she said she added this is more poignant especially given rising populations an increasing culture of protectionism in global trade markets and the sluggish growth of manufacturing a key sector in the transformation process also as you are aware it has been estimated that financing the sdgs will require an additional 638 billion annually highlighting the glaring gap that cannot be filled with the current trends in public revenues savings and investment songwe noted that as a result african countries are already observing the financial pressure on governments as they seek to close this gap through external financing the number of countries at high risk of debt distress 18 in all has more than doubled since 2013 while eight countries are already in distress if this pace continues there is a high risk of eroding the substantial progress made in reversing the high trend of indebtedness in african countries experienced at the beginning of this century she warned she also said between 2000 and last year africa had the lowest average ratio of government revenue to gdp of any region in the world at 24 5 per cent compared to latin america for example at 27 8 per cent adding that this is not due to lack of effort as over the last two decades the number of african countries which have tax to gdp ratios under 15 per cent fell by half a significant achievement despite widespread tax reforms in africa results have been mixed largely due to structural factors such as informality low per capita income and very small initial base of manufacturing and modern services by addressing capacity tax constraints africa could boost tax revenues by three per cent of gdp in addition by better aligning tax rates and revenue with business cycles african countries can boost government revenue as a share of gdp by five per cent she said she noted further that with just over a decade remaining to achieve the goals set out in agenda 2030 it is imperative that the scope and mechanisms of domestic resource mobilisation be revolutionised to bridge the financing gap promote macro economic stability and limit costly external borrowing
this limited partnership checks off all the boxes there are hundreds of high yield dividend stocks on the market at least that s the case if your definition of high dividend yield isn t too high i personally set the threshold for high yield at 4 although some prefer to use 5 or even higher my portfolio includes several high yield dividend stocks however there are quite a few other stocks with yields of 4 or more that i like choosing the best of these stocks that i don t already own isn t an easy task but if i could buy only one high yield dividend stock there are several reasons why brookfield infrastructure partners bip 1 37 would be it a rock solid business model what attracts me most to brookfield infrastructure isn t actually its dividend instead it s the company s rock solid business model like its name indicates brookfield infrastructure is in the business of owning and managing infrastructure assets the company focuses on long term assets that generate steady cash flow and have moats in the form of barriers to entry these characteristics also tend to cause the assets to appreciate in value over time a big plus think of a type of infrastructure asset and there s a good chance that brookfield infrastructure owns it utilities the company owns around 2 000 kilometers of regulated natural gas pipelines in brazil 2 200 kilometers of electricity transmission lines in north and south america 6 6 million electricity and natural gas connections in the u k and colombia and a coal terminal in australia brookfield infrastructure is big in other types of energy related businesses as well the company operates facilities with roughly 600 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage in the u s and canada it has 13 natural gas processing plants in canada brookfield infrastructure owns heating plants in 11 heavily populated north american cities and those are just a few examples the company s transport business segment includes an australian railroad 4 800 kilometers of rail in south america toll roads in brazil chile peru and india and 37 ports in north america the u k australia and across europe brookfield infrastructure has also jumped into data and telecommunications with around 7 000 cell towers 5 500 kilometers of fiber backbone in france and 33 data centers that service organizations across five continents there are three things that stand out in my view about brookfield infrastructure s business most of its assets are cash cows they all have very high barriers to entry and they re spread pretty evenly throughout the world around 25 of the company s cash flow comes from north america 30 from south america 25 from europe and 20 from the asia pacific region that s about as diversified as you can get from a geographic standpoint check out the latest earnings call transcript for brookfield infrastructure partners plenty of growth opportunities another thing that i really like about brookfield infrastructure partners is that it has multiple opportunities for growth and the company is well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities brookfield infrastructure thinks that there is around 150 billion of energy infrastructure opportunities in the u s alone even more opportunities exist in other countries including australia india and mexico the company s ceo sam pollock highlighted brookfield infrastructure s capital recycling program in his comments during the q4 conference call last month basically this program involves selling off low return assets then reinvesting the money into buying high return assets this helps the company avoid taking on too much debt or having to issue new shares to raise the capital needed to fund its expansion efforts several factors should drive growth opportunities for years to come governments across the world haven t invested enough in infrastructure as the condition of these infrastructure assets declines there will be no other choice but to replace them overall global economic growth will increase the demand for infrastructure assets worldwide trends such as urbanization and growing middle classes in developing nations will also fuel additional infrastructure demand about that dividend what about brookfield infrastructure s dividend technically the company refers to what most companies would call a dividend as a distribution because it s organized as a limited partnership lp but whatever name you want to use it s very good brookfield infrastructure s objective is to distribute around 65 of its funds from operations ffo to unitholders currently that translates to a yield of 4 9 the company is targeting annual distribution growth of between 5 and 9 since 2008 brookfield infrastructure s distributions have grown by a compound annual growth rate cagr of 10 simply put brookfield infrastructure partners is a high yield dividend stock that has a dividend that is likely to keep growing nicely the company s various businesses are largely insulated from intense competition brookfield infrastructure also claims an enviable track record of success if you re looking for a great high yield stock to buy my view is that this one could be it

with economic growth slowing wall street gyrated wednesday on the expectation that the federal reserve will not increase interest rates at its meeting which concludes wednesday afternoon as recently as december the fed was expected to raise rates twice this year now economists say it might raise rates only once or not at all as the central bank seeks to avoid roiling the markets it s very clear that there will be no hike on wednesday no question about that the question of course is what expectations will be presented for the rest of the year said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america the fed is likely to try and convey or better quantify this patient stance said lindsey piegza chief economist for stifel fixed income referring to fed chairman jerome powell s remarks in january the cnbc fed survey for march predicted that gdp growth will fall below 2 percent in 2020 and the number of respondents predicting any rate hikes this year fell by 18 percentage points to 60 percent some economists suggested that the fed today views avoiding or quelling market volatility as one of its main jobs one that is related to but distinct from its long term dual mandate of managing employment and inflation levels i think the fed has shown over the last several years to be very equity market dependent said andrew thrasher portfolio manager for financial enhancement group and founder of thrasher analytics their actions have often followed large moves within the u s stock market creating a third unofficial mandate for the federal reserve of volatility management in a sense over the past decade or so the fed has taken on a third mandate quietly north said it used to be balance unemployment and inflation but now they take into account financial markets he said it seems like they re providing a backstop of calm to that end economists predict that the fed remarks will downplay the importance of the so called dot plot a probability graph created by combining fed officials projections the dot plot which most recently suggested two interest rate increases for 2019 has a been a source of anxiety for wall street i think that there s a chance that the fed is going to abandon the dot plot north said the financial markets have been much better predicting what the fed s going to do than what the dot plot says he said pointing to powell s reassurance of a patient fed after a tumultuous december they pretty much came out and said we re watching the financial markets north said the fed s desire to be more accommodative of market movement could be put to the test by an economic outlook that worsens faster than expected though depending on the pace of deterioration i think the fed is going to move pretty clearly to a more defensive stance piegza said with a rate cut as soon as the end of this year some economists also worry that a more passive fed could mean a less nimble one being able to lower interest rates to stimulate spending is one of the key weapons central banks can use to combat an economic downturn the issue we face longer term is whether the fed has accumulated enough dry powder to deploy in the next recession thrasher said even with the recent series of hikes rates are still far below historical norms leaving the fed with fewer policy options thrasher said have rates gone up enough to give the fed adequate firepower he said right now they could lower rates by 240 basis points and cross their fingers that it will be enough
ahead of xi jinping s visit to italy this weekend paola subacchi and lucrezia poggetti criticise the coalition government in rome for seeking short term gains by endorsing their country s participation in china s 1 trillion ambitious belt and road initiative bri the five star movement m5s the populist party governing alongside the far right league has been the driving force behind the country s business venture italy would be the first g7 nation to collaborate in an initiative the us believes is being used by china its main trade rival to expand its political and strategic clout rattling its eu allies and the trump administration in 2018 eu governments declined to sign a joint declaration in beijing arguing the bri lacked standards on financing and transparency last month the white house warned italy not to lend legitimacy to china s infrastructure vanity project and that doing so could damage its global reputation it failed to convince prime minister giuseppe conte said that italy s signing of a memorandum of understanding mou for the bri which is due to happen this week would not jeopardise italy s commitment within the strategic transatlantic alliance or with european partners he hopes that italy would benefit from the project that envisions overland and maritime routes connecting china with europe while the details have been worked out over months of consultations conte emphasised that the mou is not legally binding but it would give italy access to an enormous market the authors are right about conte s naiveness when he thought closer bilateral ties with china could rebalance trade and boost italy s exports the inbalance is staggering italian exports to china currently total roughly 13 billion 14 7 billion per year while imports are approximately 29 billion despite far more balanced trade with china neither france nor germany officially endorsed the bri poland and other eastern eu states that did have since complained that the promised economic opportunities never materialized the global infrastructure project aimed at connecting asia the middle east africa and europe via a network of ports railways tunnels etc and redefining trade routes conte looks forward to having new airports new trade corridors which would boost italy s economic growth we don t want to lose any opportunity he said yet in parliament the opposition attacked the planned mou and the lack of detail provided to lawmakers warning that the deal could be a trojan horse for china to undermine italian industries concerns also focus on whether the accords include 5g access the eu meanwhile fears the new agreement with china will invoke divisions with member states wary of beijing s expansionist goals the initiative has been widely criticised for mostly benefiting chinese companies and potentially creating debt traps in poorer countries even lawmakers from the right wing league part of conte s coalition said they support the mou only if it does not harm italy s relations with its partners and pose a security threat exerting control over italians data and energy they do not mind that china invests in railways and ports as long as the control remains in italian hands the biggest problem critics see is that italy pursued deals with china without properly keeping its eu allies informed only time can tell whether joining the bri would revive italy s sluggish economy and help open up greater access to china s lucrative market the authors propose rather than unilaterally endorse china s global trade and investment strategy the italian government should be developing a more balanced china strategy in partnership with the other eu members an eu that spoke with one voice would have far more negotiating power than italy can ever hope to wield on its own and thus would be in a better position to advance italy s interests vis à vis china many in europe put the blame on trump s trade war with america s old allies driving them into china s arms

ireland has finally secured a foothold at the summit of european central banking following the appointment of central bank governor philip lane to the six member executive board of the ecb as chief economist mr lane has served on the 23 person governing council of the bank since his appointment as governor in 2015 mr lane has built up a strong international reputation as an economist having earned a doctorate from harvard university and as an assistant professor in columbia university in new york as governor of the irish central bank he has been a steady hand acting to restrain the growth in lending to home borrowers despite a degree of political pressure to ensure that the loan taps are turned on he has been helped in this regard by a finance minister paschal donohoe who is instinctively cautious and by the collective memory of the banking excesses of the noughties cantor fitzgerald economist alan mcquaid believes that philip lane has left a significant legacy in the area of economic analysis and reportage he points out that the development of a much more realistic measure of irish national output known as gni taking into account the gyrations in recorded gdp resulting from activities such as aircraft leasing and tax driven multinational firm profits is in large part down to mr lane the gni measurement provides a much more sobering account of the true state of the country s ongoing indebtedness both public and private philip lane will be arriving to take up his full time post in frankfurt at a time when the european economy is slowing markedly global growth has come off the boil and germany in particular is faced with an export slowdown on a number of fronts as uncertainties around prospects for the chinese growth engine abound closer to home there are real concerns in member states with violent street protests in france mass separatist activity in catalonia populism and economic meltdown in italy and the emergence of a series of nationalist leaders in eastern europe china is sniffing at europe s soft underbelly scenting opportunity deals under president xi s belt and road initiative have been sealed with serbia portugal and now italy the danger is that cash hungry countries could be suckered into projects with the chinese that increase their indebtedness however it can also be argued that the china factor could give neglected mediterranean countries badly needed bargaining leverage with northern european countries otherwise inclined to wash their hands of their struggling neighbours china was prepared for example to invest in the greek port of piraeus at a time when few others would touch the greeks with a barge pole that said at a time when many euro area countries are faced with fiscal constraints and when key paymaster states remain reluctant to release the funding to back a common european set of fiscal arrangements the role of the ecb as a primer of the economic pump continues to be critical the ongoing brexit drama should not distract from the stark fact that the eu is facing into a period of potentially dramatic upheaval following the elections to the european parliament we will be into a period when a new president of the european commission is due to be appointed in the autumn mario draghi will also step down as president of the ecb during his term of office he has pursued an aggressive policy of quantitative easing a strategy aimed at boosting economic activity by in effect priming the monetary pump since his famous statement in 2012 that he would do what it takes to preserve the eurozone troubled periphery nations have been brought back from the brink the former german finance minister wolfgang schauble a key figure in the eurozone crisis has revealed that he favoured a temporary greek exit from the eurozone perhaps lasting ten years this plan never came to pass in large part because of mr draghi s sure touch and resistance from chancellor merkel six months ago the eurozone was enjoying a modest recovery with ireland leading the way as recently as november the ecb head talked of a wind down in quantitative easing but since christmas the mood has changed markedly at the top of the ecb tower in frankfurt the big question is whether mr draghi s dovish approach will survive his departure mr lane is seen as being in this camp and he may have to exert a greater influence in the organisation in support of that approach depending on who takes over many in the financial markets appear to favour current executive board member benoit coeure for the job but there are more conservative figures in the frame including germany s jens weidmann a hardliner and the finn erkki liikanen mr weidmann was described last year by foreign policy magazine as the most dangerous man in europe because of his uncompromising approach as head of the german bundesbank mr lane s own post as governor will also have to be filled it is being suggested that the ecb acted to lever mr lane into the job effectively vetoing moves to install a senior official from the department of finance if the ecb were to intervene again it could lean towards another highly experienced economist alan ahearne at nui galway with the central bank s top regulator sharon donnery also in the frame mr lane arrives at a time when key decisions over the future of central banking in europe are required the whole area of risk sharing across the eurozone remains a very live issue the question of how to tweak quantitative easing to improve flows of funds to where they can be most effectively deployed comes up the london school of economics economist paul de grauwe argues that an eu government bond buying programme can be structured so as to ensure that the german taxpayer is not on the hook he believes that political opposition to such activity critical to ensuring that member state interest rate burdens are minimised can be overcome there are flaws in the bank s governance and the manner in which it can exercise its powers the maastricht treaty ordained that maintaining price stability would be the ecb s primary mandate there is a secondary mandate to support economic activity but this needs boosting many believe at the same time that the ecb is insufficiently accountable given the power it has to impact on the political and economic fortunes of its members thirty years ago then bundesbank head karl otto pohl warned that in a monetary union with irreversibly fixed exchange rates the weak would become ever weaker and the strong ever stronger the obstacles remain considerable in the form of restive populations attracted by nationalist populist rhetoric not to mention legal objections in uncertain times it is a source of some comfort at least that we will now have an irishman seated at the very top table in the ecb with the intellectual capacity to consider many of the great questions of our time
there is a memorable line in the 1942 film casablanca when rick humphrey bogart tells his former lover ilsa ingrid bergman that we ll always have paris beyond classic cinema that line applies to all of us we ll always have paris specifically the french capital on december 12 2015 when parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change reached a landmark agreement to combat climate change while accelerating actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future the paris agreement was historic as for the first time it brought all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects the key aspects of the agreement include limiting global temperature increase to well below two degrees celsius reaching global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible binding commitments by all parties to prepare communicate and maintain a nationally determined contribution and pursue domestic measures to achieve them and strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change the paris agreement opened for signature on april 22 2016 earth day at the un headquarters in new york the us and entered into force on november 4 2016 since then various countries have ratified and continue to ratify the agreement to date 185 parties out of 197 have ratified the convention the european union has long been committed to efforts tackling climate change it has taken various initiatives since 1991 when it issued the first community strategy to limit carbon dioxide emissions and improve energy efficiency a comprehensive package of policy measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has been initiated through the european climate change programme each of the eu member states has also put in place its own domestic actions that build on the eccp measures or complement them last november the european commission adopted a clean planet for all a strategic long term vision for a prosperous modern competitive and climate neutral economy by 2050 this strategy which is in line with the paris agreement objective to keep temperature increase to well below two degrees celsius and pursue efforts to keep it to 1 5 degrees celsius shows how europe can lead the way to climate neutrality by investing in realistic technological solutions empowering citizens and aligning action in key areas such as industrial policy finance and research the purpose of this long term strategy is not to set targets but to create a vision and sense of direction plan for it and inspire as well as enable stakeholders researchers entrepreneurs and citizens alike to develop new and innovative industries businesses and associated jobs the eu is committed to efforts tackling climate change the strategy is backed by a strong mandate by eu citizens eurobarometer research shows that last november 93 per cent of europeans believed climate change to be caused by human activity while 83 per cent agreed that fighting climate change and using energy efficiently can create economic growth in europe following the launch of this strategy the european commission invited the european council parliament committee of the regions and the economic and social committee to consider the eu vision for a climate neutral europe by 2050 in order to prepare eu heads of state and government for shaping the future of europe at the european council on may 9 ministers in all relevant council formations were encouraged to hold extensive policy debates on the contribution of their respective policy areas to the overall vision member states were also asked to submit their draft national climate and energy plan to the european commission malta s plan which is open for public consultation until april 10 was developed in line with the obligations of regulation eu 2018 1999 of the european parliament and of the council on the governance of the energy union and climate action the draft also follows the scope of the energy union and covers its five dimensions energy security internal energy market energy efficiency decarbonization and research innovation and competitiveness malta has to submit its final plan to the european commission by the end of december 2019 within the context of national efforts the eu will continue to ensure that its energy and climate policies as well as its research and innovation investment industrial policy and social cohesion policies steadily steer towards the decarbonised future the commission has also mainstreamed climate action including clean energy transition in its funding programmes and aligns all other policy areas to support the transformation in research and development eu programmes must support the drive in zero carbon technology innovation in stimulating change in the finance industry the commission s action plan on financing sustainable growth will create the framework necessary to support a movement towards green investment first in the eu but also globally socially to ensure a fair and inclusive transition the eu will continue to provide support for the development of new opportunities in regions and communities affected by these transformational challenges the risk of energy poverty will remain an essential challenge to be addressed the social consequences are generally better addressed through the social policy and welfare systems the financing of which could benefit from tax shifts and revenue recycling the transition will also require much stronger awareness empowerment and encouragement of citizens and consumers citizens are increasingly concerned about climate change and its consequences but they need to be equipped to take informed decisions on the impacts of their mobility and consumption choices how they travel how they produce and consume energy and how they build and renovate their houses better labelling and information on their environmental footprint can help socially fair environmental taxation and carbon pricing systems should also play an important role in steering this transition the ec notes moving towards a net zero greenhouse gas economy can only be successful when citizens embrace change and experience it as beneficial for their lives and those of their children clean mobility transportation has been essential to life trade and commerce for thousands of years yet transportation is repeatedly identified as the primary cause of traffic congestion and parking issues especially as the local stock of licensed motor vehicles is constantly on the increase the latest available statistics from the national statistics office show how in the third quarter of 2018 the number of licensed vehicles stood at 382 605 during the same quarter the stock of licensed vehicles increased at a net average of 36 vehicles per day within the context of the quality of life that is associated with traffic jams productivity issues related to lost time commuting and pollution also in view of the 2020 eu emission reduction targets it s high time to get up to speed with sustainable transportation malta like all member states has taken on binding annual targets until 2020 for cutting emissions in different sectors including transport the package which differs according to national wealth from a 20 per cent cut for the richest countries to a maximum 20 per cent increase for the least wealthy ones sets three key targets 20 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels 20 per cent of eu energy from renewables and 20 per cent improvement in energy efficiency the european commission monitors progress every year with each country required to report its emissions since 2013 malta has missed its annual targets according to a 2018 european environment agency report entitled trends and projections in europe malta s emission levels are set to remain constant until 2020 under existing measures missing its final targets moreover malta registered the largest emissions increase mainly due to higher electricity production and the reduction of electricity imports in reaction to the trends and projections in europe report government said malta s dependence on a service economy meant the only avenue for reducing emissions was the transport sector in fact a ban on the sale of diesel and petrol cars could come into effect much closer than 2040 environment minister josé herrera has said moreover as reported by the times of malta on march 8 prime minister joseph muscat announced during the first e mobility summit that the government is ready to listen to proposals on how we can make the maltese islands the first european state running its cars on electricity the private sector is also making efforts in the transport sector with one company introducing a national car sharing scheme using environmentally friendly vehicles the key role that mobility plays was highlighted by commissioner for transport violeta bulc following the launch of a clean planet for all when she said all transport modes should contribute to the decarbonisation of our mobility system the goal is to reach net zero emissions by 2050 this requires a system approach with low and zero emission vehicles strong increase in rail network capacity and a much more efficient organisation of the transport system based on digitalisation incentives for behavioural changes alternative fuels and smart infrastructure and global commitments all this driven by innovation and investments the goal is net zero emissions by 2050 specifically for trucks a provisional agreement has been reached between the eu s institutions for a regulation setting for the first time a legally binding 30 reduction target in emission standards for trucks the rule will apply only to new trucks from 2030 a reduction in emissions targets was also agreed for vehicles and vans co₂ emissions from new cars in 2030 will be 37 5 per cent below the targets for 2021 whilst for new vans the reduction target would be 31 per cent by 2030 as part of the sets of legislative proposals on clean mobility introduced by the juncker commission it is a further stepping stone for modernising the european mobility sector and preparing it for climate neutrality in the second half of the century the european commission said for prof attard director of the university s institute for climate change and sustainable development malta s transportation system is predominantly road based an inherited system of developing roads we re investing heavily in road transportation and private mobility to ensure economic progress she said economic growth necessitates greater movement of goods and people this prof attard said fuels car dependence maria attard the common belief is that the only possible way for this growth to be sustained is by continuing to push the private car as the transport mode of choice the consequence of this is congestion with the resulting delays the latter come at huge economic costs her concerns are echoed by steve zammit lupi public relations officer for the bicycle advocacy group government did well to dismantle the marsa power station but that leaves us with another big polluter our road vehicles of these 78 per cent are private vehicles a leading air polluter he said adding how while locally there is significant awareness on environmental issues the choice of alternatives is limited i do think that people in general want to change their lifestyle he said but are the transport alternatives available and safely presented if you look around all you see is infrastructural projects for more car lanes and projects for larger car parks the emphasis is always on the car do authorities expect people to go to work by bicycle tomorrow when the projects being implemented actually encourage people to increase their dependency on cars he further acknowledged the fact that even though there are policies and ideas that the european commission is pushing the planning and implementation of road networks is up to the decision of every individual member state prof attard said the eu did request a transport masterplan from the maltese government in 2016 which was delivered and positively received however every year in the semester report it talks about the lack of effort in this field of sustainability the eu wants malta to improve but there is an element of scale and how far the eu can go into national issues prof attard and mr zammit lupi concur that meeting the targets set by the eu is essential because of legal obligations but also because malta s current transport infrastructure is causing a financial burden in the form of mounting health and environmental costs steve zammit lupi the latest european health interview survey shows how the high number of cars in malta contributes to an increase in allergies research published in the european heart journal last week showed that in malta 576 people die prematurely ever year of diseases brought on by airborne pollutants prof attard said we have a list of impacts from our transport infrastructure among which are road accidents obesity an increase in the number of injuries as well as deaths we don t exercise and always park closest to where we have to go and if we don t we grumble because we have to walk she added our transportation system today is designed around the private vehicle rather than individual mobility most would even argue that driving one s own vehicle is the most practical and comfortable means of transportation zammit lupi argued that it depends on what is understood by comfortable i can cycle with my e bike from ħaż żebbuġ to ħamrun in 10 minutes valletta in 18 minutes sliema in 20 minutes including parking why should i should be using a car instead as a keen bicycle commuter himself zammit lupi detailed how the benefits of a green transport system is a win win for everyone he said that we tend to waste hours on end in traffic congestions and looking for parking spots also people generally have a wrong perception of distance we stopped measuring distance as the actual distance from one place to another but rather in how much time stuck in traffic it would take us to get there the average commute in malta is only five kilometres which is the equivalent of a 15 minute bicycle ride it s ridiculously short but people are taking an hour to do it by car where cycling is concerned malta is lagging when compared to other eu member states steve zammit lupi said this is caused by focusing on cars with little or no attention given to other modes of transport although there have been attempts to encourage cycling zammit lupi judges these attempts as poor in implementation and lacking political will we can continue to encourage car ownership by adding more car lanes build larger car parks and prioritise cars in every way possible or else we pull the handbrake and start making difficult decisions prof attard added the car is the least efficient mode of transport because it takes up a lot of space for just one individual she also related how priority should be given to walkers cyclists and buses the latter because they carry the most people and lastly the car prof attard maintained that we are currently reversing that we do have a growing cycling community at the university prof attard said and we have people who walk but our transport system needs to be more amiable to the people who are ready for change protecting the environment the european parliament enjoys an established history of strong environmental protection and ambitious climate policies it has called for targets to be maximised and for the eu to play the strongest possible role in international climate talks for example before the united nations climate change conference that finalised the paris agreement in 2015 parliament adopted a resolution calling for the inclusion of a possible 1 5 c maximum temperature rise in the agreement parliament has also consistently pushed for ambitious eu energy efficiency and renewable energy targets on the basis that they would drive innovation and lead to the creation of high quality jobs while making it more likely that climate goals can be achieved major ngos from the green10 coalition are echoing the importance of having this area at the heart of political parties 2019 european elections campaigns in their adopted manifesto green 10 calls on the next european parliament to regulate to eliminate pollutants noise and co₂ missions in particular by delivering a strategy that makes europe a world leader in zero emission and shared transportation powered by clean renewable electricity 2020 climate and energy package the 2020 package is a set of binding legislation to ensure the eu meets its climate and energy targets for the year 2020 the targets which are headline targets of the europe 2020 strategy for smart sustainable and inclusive growth were set by eu leaders in 2007 and enacted in legislation in 2009 according to a 2018 european environment agency report entitled trends and projections in europe malta has missed its annual emissions reduction targets for 2017 furthermore malta had missed its annual targets every year since 2013 this has meant that malta had to resort to flexibility measures this takes the form of a bilateral agreement to buy another member state s extra emissions reduction points the european parliament next week on tuesday will be voting on the proposal for a regulation setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles as part of europe on the move and clean mobility package a service brought to you by the european

tax climates in the country by both the financial press and think tanks like the tax foundation in fact wyoming s tax structure is tailored to benefit its wealthiest residents with a system set up so the poorest 20 percent of the population can proportionally pay up to six times as much in taxes as their wealthy counterparts according to a 2018 report from the institute on taxation and economic policy this puts wyoming in the company of states like washington texas florida south dakota nevada tennessee pennsylvania illinois and oklahoma with these advantages the nation s richest residents have seemed to take notice according to a review of the millionaire population per state conducted by phoenix marketing international states like washington wyoming and illinois currently count some of the highest percentages of millionaires per capita out of any states in the country however between 2010 and 2016 wyoming s growth in that category 22 percent has failed to match rates of growth seen around the country following the recession particularly in states like colorado utah north dakota montana and idaho which have all seen increases in 1 million plus tax filers of 70 percent or higher in that same period according to irs data in a state ranked third best in the country by wallethub for high income earners how could this be wyoming s overreliance on extractives some of the reasoning has to do with the busts seen in the nation s extractive industries in the years following the recession particularly the 50 percent drop in oil prices and 40 percent drop in natural gas prices seen in 2015 according to wenlin liu chief economist with the economic analysis division of the wyoming department of administration and information wyoming s slow rate of millionaire growth mirrored states where there was either a high proportion of mineral extraction such as oklahoma west virginia and alaska or were hit particularly hard by the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing recession like new york massachusetts and nevada though wyoming has experienced an increase the slow growth rate is not helped by the nature of its industries the owners of which don t have to live in wyoming to reap the benefits we do have a problem with the resource curse we as a state have placed most all our eggs in the energy resource basket jason shogren a professor of economics at the university of wyoming wrote in an email today most owners of these resources don t necessarily live in wyoming anymore the question then is what other industries do we have that could generate more millionaires while wyoming did have one of the nation s highest per capita growth rates in regard to its gross domestic product in 2017 the lion s share was due to its rebounding oil and gas industry ranked 20th in the nation in terms of overall growth the wyoming economy was still well below that of colorado ranked second utah ranked fifth and idaho ranked seventh what do we have agriculture recreation service industry noted shogren and if someone has an idea that generates them a 1 million plus per year they usually leave to urban centers where the people are and where the operating costs are lower what about north dakota on the whole liu added there is not much difference between millionaires and median earning households in terms of overall migration between 2010 and 2015 the overall migration pattern in the united states continued much as it has over the past several decades with northeasterners moving to states in the southeast like florida the carolinas and georgia in the west the states with the largest population increases also experienced the largest degrees of growth for their wealthy populations including neighboring states like colorado and idaho there were some eyebrow raising exceptions however despite like wyoming an energy centric economy and a lack of a true urban center north dakota actually experienced one of the nation s highest rates of growth for millionaires much of this said liu was simply due to the fact that shifts in north dakota s extraction economy were much more significant than those seen in wyoming over the past several years between 2010 and 2015 oil production in north dakota increased nearly four times growing to 12 5 percent of the national total with employment in mineral extraction more than doubling and the state s population exploding along with it the change of oil extraction industry to north dakota is dramatic and monumental said liu it s upside down particularly to a small economic state s economic condition government revenue stream and residents income and wealth that growth has coincided with a rise in the incomes of average north dakotans between 2010 and 2015 median household income there increased by nearly 25 percent the highest such growth in the nation with the number of households earning 200 000 or more growing 160 percent wyoming s growth in that income bracket meanwhile was just over 38 percent ranked 42nd in the nation why doesn t wyoming attract more rich people wyoming s low taxes are often a point of pride when discussing the state s business climate however it has not translated to population growth particularly for migrant retirees or the adventurous wealthy looking for a friendly tax haven one significant question is whether or not wyoming has maintained prestige with the young rich who may see places like jackson the locus of the state s wealthiest as more a place to visit rather than settle down part of this said shogren is due to the state s lack of arts to attract the smarts seen in wealthier locales like palo alto california and austin texas ask yourself where would you set up your home in wyoming if you only lived here for tax purposes shogren said jackson pinedale sheridan dubois laramie saratoga ten sleep these all seem old new money nowadays what about the new new money from san francisco or austin or other it centers do they want to come to wyoming or to idaho or colorado which are both arguably a bit hipper than wyoming if a rural city invests in its arts and music scene smart hip people looking for big city amenities at small town prices will find them he added the reason more actively earning millionaires are not in wyoming has to do with non economic factors particularly pertaining to social life robin lee allen a managing partner with a private equity firm in new york city and once quoted in a piece called my trust fund made me miserable in the new york post wrote in an email a lack of renowned universities limited population diversity and the persistent boom and bust nature of the local economy limit interest in this very attractive region to traditional old school elites rising elites seek nightlife education and a diversified economy locales like new york san francisco and singapore cater to these people as these new elites mature they will probably begin acquiring third homes in wyoming he added jackson hole and billings in neighboring montana remain big draws to people of a certain culture but what about retirees or bargain hunters for the population aged 65 years or older looking to keep more of its income more people consistently moved out of wyoming than moved into it for retirement with sheridan being the only exception older migrants choose retirement destinations in the southeast such as florida georgia south carolina north carolina texas and arizona said liu tax burden is definitely a factor but the weather is still proven to be the most important factor for these older migrants wyoming s tax structure is beneficiary to the wealthy but its cost of living is also low ranked fifth in the nation according to figures presented to the wyoming legislature by the legislative service office this year however other costs soon become apparent though some studies and surveys show wyoming s tax burden as one of the nation s friendliest cheyenne for example was named as having the second lowest overall tax burden for a family earning 150 000 or less per year in the nation in a study conducted on behalf of the washington d c city government wyoming might not be as cheap as commonly thought liu pointed to the u s bureau of labor statistics consumer expenditure survey a regular study by the department that collects information on americans buying habits crunching the numbers liu notes that wyoming s median home value ranked as 21st highest in the nation and its gross rents ranked as the 29th highest in the country between 2013 and 2017 after factoring median household income for home owners and renters respectively wyoming then becomes the 24th least affordable place to live liu said and wyoming has probably one of the highest health insurance costs he added highlighting a huffington post story that named wyoming the nation s ninth least affordable state in that regard above all the main characteristic of the ultra rich is that very few of them actually have to work according to a recent piece from the tax policy institute for the top 0 1 percent of income earners those making 3 4 million or more more than half of their income comes from interest dividends and capital gains and oftentimes that money is not subject to taxation at all making the need to live in a low tax state almost a moot point many millionaires get their money from investments which are not subject to income tax at all and only to capital gains tax when they withdraw their investments so they are not even subject to any sort of income tax hillary reiter a public relations professional in park city utah wrote in an email secondly there are quite a few states with no income tax and wyoming has less to do than most of these states such as comparing it to an area such as austin texas which also has no income tax making it not a draw in any way editor s note this story has been updated to correct an error pertaining to the number of wealthy zip codes in the united states
ireland has finally secured a foothold at the summit of european central banking following the appointment of central bank governor philip lane to the six member executive board of the ecb as chief economist mr lane has served on the 23 person governing council of the bank since his appointment as governor in 2015 mr lane has built up a strong international reputation as an economist having earned a doctorate from harvard university and as an assistant professor in columbia university in new york as governor of the irish central bank he has been a steady hand acting to restrain the growth in lending to home borrowers despite a degree of political pressure to ensure that the loan taps are turned on he has been helped in this regard by a finance minister paschal donohoe who is instinctively cautious and by the collective memory of the banking excesses of the noughties cantor fitzgerald economist alan mcquaid believes that philip lane has left a significant legacy in the area of economic analysis and reportage he points out that the development of a much more realistic measure of irish national output known as gni taking into account the gyrations in recorded gdp resulting from activities such as aircraft leasing and tax driven multinational firm profits is in large part down to mr lane the gni measurement provides a much more sobering account of the true state of the country s ongoing indebtedness both public and private philip lane will be arriving to take up his full time post in frankfurt at a time when the european economy is slowing markedly global growth has come off the boil and germany in particular is faced with an export slowdown on a number of fronts as uncertainties around prospects for the chinese growth engine abound closer to home there are real concerns in member states with violent street protests in france mass separatist activity in catalonia populism and economic meltdown in italy and the emergence of a series of nationalist leaders in eastern europe china is sniffing at europe s soft underbelly scenting opportunity deals under president xi s belt and road initiative have been sealed with serbia portugal and now italy the danger is that cash hungry countries could be suckered into projects with the chinese that increase their indebtedness however it can also be argued that the china factor could give neglected mediterranean countries badly needed bargaining leverage with northern european countries otherwise inclined to wash their hands of their struggling neighbours china was prepared for example to invest in the greek port of piraeus at a time when few others would touch the greeks with a barge pole that said at a time when many euro area countries are faced with fiscal constraints and when key paymaster states remain reluctant to release the funding to back a common european set of fiscal arrangements the role of the ecb as a primer of the economic pump continues to be critical the ongoing brexit drama should not distract from the stark fact that the eu is facing into a period of potentially dramatic upheaval following the elections to the european parliament we will be into a period when a new president of the european commission is due to be appointed in the autumn mario draghi will also step down as president of the ecb during his term of office he has pursued an aggressive policy of quantitative easing a strategy aimed at boosting economic activity by in effect priming the monetary pump since his famous statement in 2012 that he would do what it takes to preserve the eurozone troubled periphery nations have been brought back from the brink the former german finance minister wolfgang schauble a key figure in the eurozone crisis has revealed that he favoured a temporary greek exit from the eurozone perhaps lasting ten years this plan never came to pass in large part because of mr draghi s sure touch and resistance from chancellor merkel six months ago the eurozone was enjoying a modest recovery with ireland leading the way as recently as november the ecb head talked of a wind down in quantitative easing but since christmas the mood has changed markedly at the top of the ecb tower in frankfurt the big question is whether mr draghi s dovish approach will survive his departure mr lane is seen as being in this camp and he may have to exert a greater influence in the organisation in support of that approach depending on who takes over many in the financial markets appear to favour current executive board member benoit coeure for the job but there are more conservative figures in the frame including germany s jens weidmann a hardliner and the finn erkki liikanen mr weidmann was described last year by foreign policy magazine as the most dangerous man in europe because of his uncompromising approach as head of the german bundesbank mr lane s own post as governor will also have to be filled it is being suggested that the ecb acted to lever mr lane into the job effectively vetoing moves to install a senior official from the department of finance if the ecb were to intervene again it could lean towards another highly experienced economist alan ahearne at nui galway with the central bank s top regulator sharon donnery also in the frame mr lane arrives at a time when key decisions over the future of central banking in europe are required the whole area of risk sharing across the eurozone remains a very live issue the question of how to tweak quantitative easing to improve flows of funds to where they can be most effectively deployed comes up the london school of economics economist paul de grauwe argues that an eu government bond buying programme can be structured so as to ensure that the german taxpayer is not on the hook he believes that political opposition to such activity critical to ensuring that member state interest rate burdens are minimised can be overcome there are flaws in the bank s governance and the manner in which it can exercise its powers the maastricht treaty ordained that maintaining price stability would be the ecb s primary mandate there is a secondary mandate to support economic activity but this needs boosting many believe at the same time that the ecb is insufficiently accountable given the power it has to impact on the political and economic fortunes of its members thirty years ago then bundesbank head karl otto pohl warned that in a monetary union with irreversibly fixed exchange rates the weak would become ever weaker and the strong ever stronger the obstacles remain considerable in the form of restive populations attracted by nationalist populist rhetoric not to mention legal objections in uncertain times it is a source of some comfort at least that we will now have an irishman seated at the very top table in the ecb with the intellectual capacity to consider many of the great questions of our time
the use of prisons has risen dramatically in the last 50 years with a tripling of incarceration rates in the us and a near doubling in western europe albeit from much lower initial levels these trends illustrated in figure 1 raise important questions about how well ex convicts reintegrate into society after incarceration and in particular whether they return to a life of crime prison could increase recidivism due to lost human capital exposure to hardened criminals or subsequent employment discrimination conversely prison time could deter future offences or have a rehabilitative effect through education and job training programmes figure 1 incarceration trends in norway western europe and the us note the western european countries used to construct the population weighted average include austria belgium denmark finland france germany greece iceland ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands norway portugal spain sweden switzerland and the uk source institute for criminal policy research world prison brief 2016 early research on the effects of prison concluded that prisoner rehabilitation programmes do not work martinson 1974 this research was influential in rehabilitation gradually taking a back seat in favour of prison policies emphasising punishment and incapacitation subsequent scholars questioned the evidence base for this conclusion cullen 2005 but as nagin et at 2009 summarise remarkably little is known about the effects of imprisonment on reoffending the existing research is limited in size in quality in its insights into why a prison term might be criminogenic or preventative understanding the effects of imprisonment has proven challenging for two reasons the first is data availability since in many countries the required panel datasets on crime and labour market outcomes either cannot be accessed or linked together second which individuals are sent to prison is not random while simple correlations reveal that ex convicts have relatively high rates of criminal activity and weak labour market attachment this could be driven by their unobserved characteristics as opposed to the experience of being in prison an emerging literature in the past decade has recognised the limitations of correlational data and uses new approaches and new datasets to sort out causal effects a norwegian experiment our recent work in norway bhuller et al forthcoming overcomes the data challenges and non randomness of incarceration offering new insights into how imprisonment affects subsequent criminal behaviour we link several administrative sources to construct a panel dataset containing complete records of the criminal behaviour and labour market outcomes of every norwegian we address threats to identification by exploiting the random assignment of criminal cases to norwegian judges these judges differ systematically in their stringency with some sending defendants to prison at a high rate while others are more lenient defendants who happen to get a stricter judge face a higher probability of being sent to prison since this increased probability is as good as random the variation in judge stringency can be used to estimate the causal effect of imprisonment our study of norway s criminal justice system yields three key findings first imprisonment discourages further criminal behaviour we find that incarceration lowers the probability an individual will reoffend within five years by 27 percentage points and reduces the corresponding number of criminal charges per individual by ten these reductions are not simply due to an incapacitation effect with sizable decreases in reoffending probabilities and cumulative charged crimes even after defendants are released from prison our second result is that a misguided correlational analysis would lead to the erroneous conclusion that time spent in prison is criminogenic if we simply compare criminal defendants sent to prison versus not sent to prison we find positive associations between incarceration and subsequent crime this is true even when we control for a rich set of demographics the type of crime committed previous criminal history and past employment third the reduction in crime is driven by individuals who were not working prior to incarceration among these individuals imprisonment causes a 34 percentage point increase in participation in job training programs and within five years their employment rate increases by 40 percentage points at the same time their likelihood of reoffending is cut in half in contrast for individuals previously attached to the labour market there is no significant effect on reoffending and an immediate and lasting 25 percentage point drop in employment the employment drop is driven almost entirely by defendants losing their job with their pre prison employer comparison to the us a handful of papers use similar random judge assignment designs in the us as we do for norway these studies find either no effect or the opposite result namely that incarceration results in higher recidivism and worse labour market outcomes mueller smith 2015 uses data from harris county texas and finds that incarceration increases both the severity and incidence of recidivism worsens labour market outcomes and increases the use of public assistance harding et al 2017 use data from michigan and find that felony criminals sentenced to prison versus probation have a higher rate of repeat crime three years later primarily as a result of violations of post prison parole conditions rose and shem tov 2018 study felony offenders in north carolina and find a large incapacitation effect while an individual is in prison but no significant effect afterwards finally aizer and doyle 2015 find that juvenile incarceration results in lower high school completion rates and higher adult incarceration rates what is norway doing differently given the stark differences in the effects of imprisonment in the us versus norway a natural question is whether the us and other countries can learn anything from norway s experience for context norway looks fairly similar to other western european countries and the us in terms of prisoner demographics and the types of crimes committed with the exceptions that homicides are higher and race plays a large role in the us shorter prison spells the average time spent in prison is six to seven months in norway and other western european countries compared to almost three years for the us this is the primary reason the us is an outlier in its incarceration rate a fact which is documented in figure 2 figure 2 incarceration rates versus gdp per capita note sample consists of 160 countries with population greater than 0 5 million and with available data on incarceration and gdp incarceration rates and gdp are for the latest available year gdp per capita is adjusted for purchasing power parity ppp and reported in 2010 us dollars the western european countries used to construct the population weighted average include austria belgium denmark finland france germany greece iceland ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands norway portugal spain sweden switzerland and the uk sources institute for criminal policy research international monetary fund and the world bank prison conditions the norwegian system places low level offenders in open prisons which have minimal security as well as more freedoms and responsibilities than a us prison more serious offenders who are at risk of violent or disruptive behaviour are sent to closed prisons with heightened security creating a separation between minor and more hardened criminals lack of overcrowding norway has a policy of one prisoner per cell this stands in contrast to the us where inmates are often double or triple bunked and with a higher inmate to staff ratio making it harder to ensure the personal safety of prisoners job training education and drug treatment programmes all prisons in norway offer education drug treatment mental health and training programs in contrast adequate funding for such initiatives is lacking in the us post release support after release in norway there is an emphasis on helping offenders reintegrate into society with access to active labour market programmes set up to help ex convicts find a job and access to a variety of social support services such as housing social assistance and disability insurance in the us the safety net is less expansive but even so ex convicts often have a difficult time accessing services cost benefit analysis our research on norway s criminal justice system serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that time spent in prison with a focus on rehabilitation can help ex convicts reintegrate into society the norwegian prison system is successful in increasing participation in job training programmes encouraging employment and discouraging crime largely due to changes in the behaviour of individuals who were not working prior to incarceration a natural question is whether the positive effects from imprisonment found in norway pass a cost benefit test the norwegian prison system spends almost double the amount per inmate per year compared to other western european countries and between two and four times more compared to us states but rough calculations suggest these high rehabilitation expenditures are more than offset by the corresponding benefits to society on the benefit side there are three broad categories first there is a reduction in criminal justice system expenditures including police department and criminal court costs due to fewer crimes being committed second there is increased employment which results in higher taxes paid and lower transfer payments we estimate that either of these first two benefit categories justifies the direct costs of prisons the third benefit category is the reduction in victimisation costs due to fewer crimes being committed in the future victimisation costs are notoriously difficult to estimate so we instead simply note that this category would make the comparison of benefits versus costs even more favourable finally it is important to note that prison reform particularly for the us is more affordable than it may initially appear this is because if prison sentences were shortened to the lengths in norway it would alleviate overcrowding and free up funds to pay for improved prison conditions as well as job training education drug treatment and post release programmes authors note this column is based on prior

enelope wurr is already starting to see shifts in how british companies are operating in the international market the brattleboro glass artist and purveyor stocks unique goods she tracks down in europe and the united kingdom but now with brexit looming u k companies seem to increasingly be interested in getting into the american market themselves a shift that could impact wurr s vermont business i have noticed already that there has been a lot more interest from british companies to sell in the u s and open up to that market in case they european market is less strong or too complicated wurr wrote in an email the tumult surrounding brexit is sending ripples into the global economy as leaders in the united kingdom and europe fumble through their divorce some vermonters are watching aware that the outcome may impact them but unclear precisely what the effect might be three years after u k voters decided to leave the european union the country was set to separate from the economic bloc on march 29 but after years of haggling over a plan for the united kingdom to decouple from europe the deal prime minister theresa may negotiated flopped in parliament mps voted it down by historic margins twice most recently last week after may s deal failed a second time british leaders sought to delay the departure date by three months european union leaders agreed to a shorter extension the length of which depends on whether parliament will agree to may s deal in the coming weeks if the deal passes u k withdrawal will be delayed until may 22 if it doesn t the u k has until april 12 to figure out a next course of action the u k is now seeking to postpone the departure date by three months but it must be approved by the european union without consent from the eu the brits could be poised to crash out with no deal in just over a week kristina sargent an assistant professor of economics at middlebury college noted the talks are not just about the future of the united kingdom this is a two sided negotiation where it s not just what s happening in the u k but it s also really up to the e u to agree to this as well sargent said the biggest goal of negotiations is to minimize the loss sargent said the events surrounding brexit have the potential to shake up international economic dynamics in ways that will resonate in the united states including in vermont so far sargent said the biggest effect has been a decline in investment noting that the united kingdom is the biggest single investor in the united states the trend of lower investment in american companies could lead to u s companies hiring fewer workers it remains to be seen however whether the decline in investment is temporary as investments are being postponed or if they are being canceled amid the uncertainty in europe and britain the u s could be in a strategic position there s opportunity for american businesses competing with those across the atlantic to take advantage of the chaos the united states could also act as a force for global economic stability by moving to strengthen trans atlantic ties she said david blanchflower a dartmouth college economics professor and a former member of the bank of england s monetary policy committee views brexit as a broad international story that provides insights into the political implications of slow economic recoveries blanchflower links british voters support of brexit in 2016 to a global wave of populism that emerged amid the slow economic recovery and widening inequality following the financial crisis of 2008 with brexit blanchflower said leaders made promises they weren t able to deliver essentially we have no credible government in the u k said blanchflower who described the situation in parliament as literally absolute total chaos similar political backlash is resonating worldwide including in the united states europe and elsewhere there are big implications for everybody about you know credibility of governments and what happens when you have long painful recoveries and big recessions blanchflower said the uncertainty around what the likely outcome of brexit will be has left some in vermont like wurr questioning whether it will alter elements of how they do business wurr the brattleboro shop owner said british products are increasingly coming through u s distributors who charge higher prices a disadvantage for her she said i was able to purchase product in the uk at the uk wholesale price which is often considerably cheaper than a landed us price she wrote in an email a u k passport holder wurr travels through europe to purchase items she sells in her brattleboro store now she has easy passage without having to show her documents that may change if brexit happens she said importing products for her shop has been fairly easy currently it s fairly hassle free to ship from the european union but she wonders if that will change too however wurr said brexit is one of many changes that she must adapt to as a retailer every year retail is bombarded with a whole bunch of new challenges brexit is just one of them wurr said the need to be innovative and fresh in this new online market is a constant dilemma the united kingdom is vermont s ninth largest export market about 80 million worth of goods was exported from the state to the united kingdom in 2017 though it appears to be a big number university of vermont associate professor of economics art woolf noted that it s a rather small portion of the state s total exports in 2017 the u k received 2 9 percent of the 2 8 billion the state exported that year vermont businesses in industries including maple and manufacturing contacted for this article said they don t expect brexit will have a direct impact but changes in the global economy related to brexit might have an effect on them collins aerospace an international aviation technology company which has a manufacturing facility in vergennes said in a statement that they are watching the situation in europe and the u k we are closely monitoring negotiations between the united kingdom and the european union and are taking steps to ensure business continuity across all of utc s business units through a hard or soft brexit spokesperson robert edelson said brexit could bring changes to the global economy and those shifts filter down to the green mountains woolf said the world economy is not doing as well as it was half a year ago he said the brexit thing is just adding to the uncertainty and the possibility that the word economy is not going to do as well as people thought one factor to watch will be the value of the pound and the euro against the dollar if the pound and euro decline in value it could be a hit to vermont exporters making it more expensive for them to sell abroad it also could have implications for the tourism industry if the pound loses strength against the dollar it would be pricier for british tourists to come to the united states and vermont woolf said but conversely it would lower the price tag for americans on vacations to the united kingdom and europe they re putting a summer vacation on sale he said country walkers a vermont based tour organizing company hasn t had any inquiries or concerns about brexit president timo shaw said they re not expecting any immediate impact it s very quiet he said noting they have not had inquiries from customers however another company milne travel with outposts in vermont and around the northeast has been getting questions about whether brexit will impact travel plans according to company president scott milne milne doesn t anticipate any immediate dramatic changes to travel between the united states and the united kingdom we don t want to just stick our heads in the sand and say don t worry but there s still an awful lot of unknowns milne said the sudden cancelation of flights in case of a hard brexit as has been speculated is unlikely he said travel wise a worst case might be a new tourism visa requirement to enter the uk but those would likely be low level and easy to get for u s citizens he said the bigger concerns milne said go beyond tourism and the travel industry in the meantime milne travel will keep an eye on the situation it s just sort of one of these things let s just see out it turns out he said what you want is to make sure you re not ambushed by not paying attention to changes
romeo gacad afp getty images cepal these huge numbers also suggest that the united states should follow the lead of oklahoma and start collecting a share of the remittances to help mitigate the costs of illegal immigration you could build a wall with some of that money compensate victims of illegal immigration and much more and congress should do it chart pew research center the sums of money involved are huge particularly as a share of gdp and personal income in the central american countries it offers a big clue as to why these countries are giving only token efforts to stem the tide of migrants to the united states especially el salvador and honduras a good leader would try to develop other ways to build the economy that benefit more people instead of just those who have family in the united states they are betting that the united states will never have the will to enforce its laws and that s been a good bet so far immigrants from the three central american nation s sourcing many illegal border crossers sent a record amount of money home last year bringing the total this decade to 120 billion all said that natives in the united states sent over 17 billion home last year alone according to an immigration expert citing united nations and latin american banking data and newly released central american bank data said that the record breaking has continued this year the so called remittances have been in the focus of some immigration reform advocatesunder one proposal that failed to pass congress remittances would be taxed 7 percent pew research center revealed in january that immigrants in the united states sent home 138 billion in 2016 alone immigration expert jessica vaughan of the center for immigration studies stated money immigrants send home is a huge part of the economy of those three nations reaching over 20 percent in el salvador and honduras vaughan who regularly testifies before congress on immigration policy said
this limited partnership checks off all the boxes there are hundreds of high yield dividend stocks on the market at least that s the case if your definition of high dividend yield isn t too high i personally set the threshold for high yield at 4 although some prefer to use 5 or even higher my portfolio includes several high yield dividend stocks however there are quite a few other stocks with yields of 4 or more that i like choosing the best of these stocks that i don t already own isn t an easy task but if i could buy only one high yield dividend stock there are several reasons why brookfield infrastructure partners bip 1 37 would be it a rock solid business model what attracts me most to brookfield infrastructure isn t actually its dividend instead it s the company s rock solid business model like its name indicates brookfield infrastructure is in the business of owning and managing infrastructure assets the company focuses on long term assets that generate steady cash flow and have moats in the form of barriers to entry these characteristics also tend to cause the assets to appreciate in value over time a big plus think of a type of infrastructure asset and there s a good chance that brookfield infrastructure owns it utilities the company owns around 2 000 kilometers of regulated natural gas pipelines in brazil 2 200 kilometers of electricity transmission lines in north and south america 6 6 million electricity and natural gas connections in the u k and colombia and a coal terminal in australia brookfield infrastructure is big in other types of energy related businesses as well the company operates facilities with roughly 600 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage in the u s and canada it has 13 natural gas processing plants in canada brookfield infrastructure owns heating plants in 11 heavily populated north american cities and those are just a few examples the company s transport business segment includes an australian railroad 4 800 kilometers of rail in south america toll roads in brazil chile peru and india and 37 ports in north america the u k australia and across europe brookfield infrastructure has also jumped into data and telecommunications with around 7 000 cell towers 5 500 kilometers of fiber backbone in france and 33 data centers that service organizations across five continents there are three things that stand out in my view about brookfield infrastructure s business most of its assets are cash cows they all have very high barriers to entry and they re spread pretty evenly throughout the world around 25 of the company s cash flow comes from north america 30 from south america 25 from europe and 20 from the asia pacific region that s about as diversified as you can get from a geographic standpoint check out the latest earnings call transcript for brookfield infrastructure partners plenty of growth opportunities another thing that i really like about brookfield infrastructure partners is that it has multiple opportunities for growth and the company is well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities brookfield infrastructure thinks that there is around 150 billion of energy infrastructure opportunities in the u s alone even more opportunities exist in other countries including australia india and mexico the company s ceo sam pollock highlighted brookfield infrastructure s capital recycling program in his comments during the q4 conference call last month basically this program involves selling off low return assets then reinvesting the money into buying high return assets this helps the company avoid taking on too much debt or having to issue new shares to raise the capital needed to fund its expansion efforts several factors should drive growth opportunities for years to come governments across the world haven t invested enough in infrastructure as the condition of these infrastructure assets declines there will be no other choice but to replace them overall global economic growth will increase the demand for infrastructure assets worldwide trends such as urbanization and growing middle classes in developing nations will also fuel additional infrastructure demand about that dividend what about brookfield infrastructure s dividend technically the company refers to what most companies would call a dividend as a distribution because it s organized as a limited partnership lp but whatever name you want to use it s very good brookfield infrastructure s objective is to distribute around 65 of its funds from operations ffo to unitholders currently that translates to a yield of 4 9 the company is targeting annual distribution growth of between 5 and 9 since 2008 brookfield infrastructure s distributions have grown by a compound annual growth rate cagr of 10 simply put brookfield infrastructure partners is a high yield dividend stock that has a dividend that is likely to keep growing nicely the company s various businesses are largely insulated from intense competition brookfield infrastructure also claims an enviable track record of success if you re looking for a great high yield stock to buy my view is that this one could be it

as a proponent of initiatives that expand business growth and strengthen our economy i understand the need for businesses to seek tax policy that improves their bottom line and provides opportunity for expansion however it shouldn t be up to the federal government to decide which products fail and which succeed that should be left up to the consumer one prime and unfortunate anti free market example is the current electric vehicle ev tax credit currently the government heavily subsidizes evs using taxpayer dollars to provide ev purchasers with a 7 500 tax credit this credit only exists for the first 200 000 cars a manufacturer produces in a year then is set to phase down for 6 quarters until it expires for that company however companies like nissan tesla and general motors are pushing hard to lift this 200 000 car cap and extend the ev tax credit permanently perhaps a cap lift could be justified if the ev market was showing promising growth with a consistent and significant rise in sales but that is not the case despite millions of dollars in subsidies and rebates the majority of americans still aren t buying evs battery electric vehicles bevs accounted for just 0 06 percent of light duty vehicles sold in 2017 plug in hybrid electric vehicles phevs reached a 0 05 percent share while non plug in hybrids sales fell from 3 0 percent in 2012 to 1 9 percent in 2017 ev manufacturers hope removing the cap will incentivize more ev purchases but this really means they want the government to continue using taxpayer dollars to prop up their small sector of the auto industry what s more concerning these tax dollars are supporting a market where the majority of tax credits only benefit wealthy california purchasers as more evs are sold in california than all other states combined in 2017 california sold more than 1 860 times as many evs than wyoming with only 51 evs sold in our state representing roughly 0 25 percent of all light duty vehicles sold in the state that year the astronomical difference in state ev purchases essentially means the government is funneling the wealth of wyoming taxpayers across state lines so that california drivers can enjoy a 7 500 tax credit moreover this credit disproportionately impacts low income consumers in 2015 the median household income in the u s was 56 516 yet two thirds of ev owning households have an annual income of more than 100 000 however since subsidies for evs and supporting infrastructure are paid by all taxpayers a disparate share of the costs of ev subsidy programs will continue to be borne by lower income consumers who can t even afford to purchase the products their tax dollars are benefiting luckily our state s own senator john barrasso recently introduced the fairness for every driver act that would put an end to the federal tax credits saving billions in taxpayer funds while also making sure all drivers pay into the account that improves america s roads as ev owners don t pay the gas taxes that are used to support highway infrastructure sen barrasso s bill will impose a federal highway user fee on alternative fuel vehicles these fees will generate billions for the highway trust fund over the next 10 years uncapping and extending the ev tax credit is bad fiscal policy our government officials should seek economic incentives that improve the industry for all drivers rather than propping up a failing sector that only benefits the wealthiest americans senator barrasso s legislation is a step in the right direction and congress should take note

within 10 years the united states will phase out fossil fuels and source its energy from 100 renewable sources that s what a letter signed by over 600 people and sent to congress on january 10 2019 proposes and demands the signatories also call for making every building in the us energy efficient and eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing agriculture and transport achieving all these targets within the next 25 years would be very ambitious within the next 10 years requires not just a green transition but a green revolution the signatories know that which is why they propose that the federal government should lead this revolution and become the primary funder of this green new deal but how exactly would that work and what would it mean for the economy a new deal for workers the green new deal demands the polar opposite of austerity from government instead of fiscal frugality the state would have to pump large sums of money into society and the economy in an effort to overhaul everything this follows the ideas of modern monetary theory which sees government debt as normal and possibly even desirable as long as it helps foster an economy that benefits the common good and keeps people economically active governments and central banks would use state expenditure to keep unemployment low and to subsidise key decarbonisation activities such as creating electrified mass transport and making buildings energy efficient even though this would lead to a noticeable increase in national debt the government would also have to increase taxes especially on wealth capital gains and corporations in addition to being the main funder of the transition the state would also act as an employer of last resort since the green new deal promises employment for everybody this is a huge commitment considering that there would be significant job losses in fossil fuel dependent industries it won t just be coal workers being made redundant many workers in the car industry steel manufacturing large scale agriculture and food processing would lose their jobs too while it s true that many new jobs will be created as part of the green transition two issues remain can workers be retrained quickly enough to take on these new jobs or are the skills required simply too different will new green jobs be sustainable or will there just be a green boom during the transition followed by a harsh awakening and growing unemployment green universal basic income in the short and medium term full employment seems actually quite unrealistic unless the state forces people to work in jobs they don t want instead a green new deal should prioritise the introduction of a universal basic income to give people the freedom to refuse poorly paid work with bad working conditions the idea of a universal basic income is simple instead of means tested social welfare payments for people who are outside of paid employment the state would pay every member of society a monthly basic income allowance this money would come from absorbing the existing means tested welfare streams and taxing the new hubs of economic activity such as green technology manufacturing in an economy where not everybody might be able to get suitable employment this basic income allowance would cover essential living costs and allow people to pursue meaningful activities outside of work introducing a universal basic income would have advantages for delivering a green new deal if the radical changes of the green new deal aren t supposed to punish workers in the current fossil fuel dependent economy giving these people who most likely will lose their jobs a guaranteed alternative would create support for the transition and make sure that those most vulnerable to the proposed changes don t get left behind instead of creating state funded jobs just for the sake of employing people the state could empower many of its citizens to lead more sustainable lives as part of the green transition a universal basic income might offer citizens time to engage in fulfilling community based work that does not generate profit but which has social value taking them out of their cars in long lines of commuter traffic and putting them in allotments growing food or in parks enjoying nature could help usher a whole new way of life a generous universal basic income would destigmatise work outside of paid employment such as domestic care work and volunteering in the arts and community sectors and it would allow people to refuse environmentally harmful and badly paid jobs new income detached from wage labour would mean new flows of money in the economy breaking the cycle of energy intensive production and consumption which drives much of emissions to win popular support for the green new deal its benefits must be truly universal what better way to guarantee a just green transition and ensure no one is left behind than universal basic income fabian schuppert is lecturer in

washington amazon com inc s planned second headquarters in northern virginia cleared a key test on saturday when local officials approved a proposed financial package worth an estimated 51 million amid a small but vocal opposition amazon in november picked national landing a site jointly owned by arlington county and the city of alexandria just outside washington along with new york city for its so called hq2 or second headquarters that followed a year long search in which hundreds of municipalities ranging from newark new jersey to indianapolis competed for the coveted tax dollars and high wage jobs the project promises amazon in february abruptly scrapped plans to build part of its second headquarters in the new york borough of queens after opposition from local leaders angered by incentives promised by state and city politicians the five member arlington county board voted 5 0 in favor of amazon receiving the financial package after a seven hour meeting held in a room filled with up to about 150 citizens and representatives from local unions and minority advocacy groups there was strong opposition from some residents and labor groups many of whom chanted shame and waved signs with slogans including don t be the opposite of robinhood amazon overworks and underpays and advocate for us and not amazon one protester was escorted out of the meeting by police a few dozen protesters outside the county office chanted the people united will never be defeated danny candejas an organizer for the coalition for us not amazon which opposes the company s move into the area said we are fighting to make sure people who live here are not priced out by wealthy people some supporters in the meeting held up signs saying vote yes and amazon is prime for arlington one hundred and twelve people were registered to speak an unusually high number for a local county meeting forcing board chair christian dorsey to cut the speaking time to two minutes from three for every regular speaker and to four minutes from five for representatives of organizations many speakers who were opposed to the amazon headquarters especially opposed direct incentives citing rising housing costs the likely displacement of low income families accelerated wage theft for construction workers and lack of investment guarantees in affordable housing funds speculators are already driving up home prices landlords are raising rents and general contractors are raising their quotes for home improvement projects said one resident hunter tamarro unions including the afl cio objected to amazon not signing a project labor agreement with wage and benefit safeguards for workers hired to construct the new buildings but supporters such as resident june o connell said amazon s presence would ensure arlington is allocated state funds for investments in transportation and higher education i want that money from the state o connell said without amazon we wouldn t get a penny of it holly sullivan amazon s worldwide head of economic development spoke briefly and said the company will invest approximately 2 5 billion create more than 25 000 jobs with an average wage of over 150 000 which will generate more than 3 2 billion in tax revenue regarding incentives amazon is only eligible for the financial incentive after we make our investments and occupy office space in the community she said dorsey the board chair had said before the vote that he expected the measure to pass he said that rejecting amazon would not solve the community s problems and concerns and that this was the first deal the county has struck where new revenue growth will be used to fund it to be sure the vote approved an estimated 51 million a fraction of the 481 million promised by the county only 5 percent of the incentives are direct also amazon has been offered a 750 million package by the state that the virginia general assembly approved with little opposition the 51 million includes a controversial direct financial incentive or cash grant of 23 million to amazon over 15 years which will be collected from taxes on arlington hotel rooms the grant is contingent upon amazon occupying six million square feet of office space over the first 16 years arlington has also offered to invest about 28 million over 10 years of future property tax revenue in onsite infrastructure and open space at the headquarters site a filing on the county board s website says the 23 million grant and the 28 million in strategic public infrastructure investments were instrumental in amazon choosing arlington for its headquarters

ted booker south bend tribune elwood ill dan caruso who worries about st joseph county s industrial development plans near the town of new carlisle took a group field trip earlier this month to the village of elwood in illinois the new carlisle resident wanted to learn more about how undesired consequences from the massive logistics and warehouse hub in elwood population 2 200 might be repeated near new carlisle population 1 900 near new carlisle the county has proposed an industrial park called the indiana enterprise center across 22 000 acres that is now dominated by farmland and in a related effort about 10 miles east of the town the county plans to launch a rail to air logistics hub near south bend international airport before going on the march 8 trip caruso read an article in the new republic about how elwood has had lots of setbacks since a massive freight terminal set up shop just a few years after the centerpoint intermodal freight terminal opened in 2002 along the burlington north santa fe railroad elwood became the biggest inland port in north america with billions of dollars in goods crossing through the area each year shipping containers arrive on trains and are transported by trucks to huge warehouses owned by retail giants such as walmart amazon and home depot today about 300 warehouses are scattered across will county which elwood is part of caruso read in the article that warehouses are mostly staffed by workers who commute from outside elwood and staffing agencies often recruit workers to work for third party companies under short term contracts without the guarantee of permanent work the influx of truck traffic meanwhile has taken a toll on roads and caused an uptick in deadly crashes and though the article said the terminal was supposed to spur commercial and retail development to boost property taxes that vision never became reality elwood in fact is saddled with more than 30 million in debt as a result of a deal that created a tax increment financing district for centerpoint that doesn t expire until 2022 caruso wanted to see firsthand if what he read about truck traffic and warehouses was true so what did he take away from the elwood trip he returned to new carlisle with even more concerns with the toll road rail and major highways being similarly situated here like they are in elwood new carlisle is in a perfect spot to bring more stuff like that he said there s room for pretty much whatever they want to bring smokestacks or logistics but is it really that grim for elwood john greuling ceo of the will county center for economic development said the pluses of the logistics hub outweigh the negatives he said that while some employees have short term seasonal contracts with third party logistics companies the majority of them work directly for companies that own the distribution centers most of them are single company operations that operate year round with permanent full time employees who have benefits he said companies are looking for more full time workers than part time or seasonal workers so could such an enormous logistics hub be in the cards for the proposed indiana enterprise center local officials won t say st joseph county economic development director bill schalliol and county commissioner president andy kostielney didn t return calls seeking comment the field trip a tribune reporter joined caruso and two other members of the st joseph county open space and agricultural alliance on the trip to elwood the alliance is a community coalition supported by environmentalists farmers and others with concerns about the county s development plans elwood has a small strip mall and a downtown area with a few shops and municipal buildings on the western edge of downtown is a park with a playground that is a short walk from warehouses caruso who noted the truck traffic thought the village could have picked a better spot for the park would you want your kids to come play at this park he asked in dismay the centerpoint terminal was built on land previously occupied by an army ammunition plant that was shut down decades ago the brownfield site couldn t be used for farming and elwood struggled to find uses for it until centerpoint stepped in at the time elwood also agreed to build a water and sewer system for the terminal and it built a new municipal building to plan for population growth back then elwood officials thought creating a tax increment finance district would collect enough revenue to cover infrastructure projects but the deal backfired because the village hasn t drawn enough taxes to pay off long term bonds greuling said elwood was put into a financial predicament because it expected to draw a lot more revenue from businesses envisioned for the tif district they were anticipating bigger development in terms of utility requirements he said there was a site zoned for a huge power plant which would have generated all kinds of property taxes but it was never built roberto jesus clack associate director for will county based warehouse workers for justice said the village is still paying the price for the deal it made the county has nearly 100 staffing agencies that recruit workers for warehouses clack said the majority of workers in elwood commute from outside the area and he believes they often work for third party logistics companies instead of directly for retail giants that own the warehouses workers come from all over the place especially from the south side or west side of chicago clack said adding that third party companies offer low quality jobs and make it difficult for workers to unionize we see it as a way to get around giving benefits to employees greuling however said there are plenty of full time jobs with decent wages he said amazon which has five distribution centers in the county and employs 7 000 workers pays employees at least 15 an hour almost every other distribution center has had to do that to compete he said amazon meanwhile could soon have a presence in the south bend area it recently filed documents indicating it plans to open a delivery center with more than 100 employees at a warehouse that is part of the ameriplex at interstate 80 90 business park on south bend s northwest side near the airport debra durall an organizer for the open space and agricultural alliance highlighted how the proposed industrial park in the new carlisle area is part of a broader area studied by the county that encompasses the logistics park planned near the south bend airport she worries plans could result in a huge logistics hub similar to the one in elwood many of the elwood residents were sold on the jobs and economics but now they see it as a mistake they feel like it s made the community worse and now that it s started they re finding it nearly impossible to stop she said durall also fears she might have seen a preview in elwood of the kind of truck traffic that could come to the new carlisle area at points we were stuck in the semi truck traffic with passenger cars whizzing down the shoulder she said it was more traffic than i ve ever been in just say no to northpoint in summer 2017 a group organized in the elwood area to take a stand against a proposed additional industrial park northpoint proposed building 30 plus warehouses across more than 2 000 acres of farmland between elwood and manhattan the neighboring village to the east when they found out their homes were near the proposed zone stephanie irvine and delilah legrett helped launch just say no to northpoint they said the group rallied the community to oppose the project it launched a facebook page organized meetings and requested public records from elwood officials in late 2017 the village s planning and zoning board recommended the project to be approved by the village board but legrett and irvine said as community pressure swelled some of the elected officials who supported the project resigned the measure was never brought to a vote last year because there wasn t enough support and the developer withdrew its application with the village irvine said northpoint has tried to bypass village by filing a project application with will county but she said the effort has stalled and she thinks it will difficult to get the project approved we ve thrown some significant roadblocks their way she said adding that elwood needs to make roads and bridges safe before it considers allowing more warehouses we have to stop the bleeding first
the newly introduced cradle act will make social security s already precarious outlook worse few if any social programs bear more importance to our nation s senior citizens than social security each month nearly 44 million retired workers receives a monthly benefit check with more than three out of five of these seniors reliant on their payout for at least half of their income you could rightly say that social security is preventing this country from a major elderly poverty crisis then again it s also a program facing a steep uphill climb even though social security is in absolutely no danger of going bankrupt the revenue it s expected to bring in over the next 75 years has been deemed insufficient to support payouts to eligible beneficiaries over that same time frame according to the 2018 social security board of trustees report if an estimated cash shortfall of 13 2 trillion between 2034 and 2092 isn t dealt with an across the board benefits cut of up to 21 may be needed per the report to be clear numerous proposals to amend social security in order to make the program stronger have been proposed by democrats and republicans albeit no consensus has been reached but every once in a while a proposal involving social security comes along that s so terrible it needs to be called out in public this is one of those instances a paid parental leave proposal tied into social security was just introduced last week sens joni ernst r iowa and mike lee r utah unveiled a new piece of legislation dubbed the cradle act which would provide paid family leave for natural or adoptive parents more specifically the cradle act would allow new parents to take between one and three months of paid leave with the catch they would be agreeing to delay the start of their social security retirement benefits here s how it would work applicants would notify the social security administration between one month and six months prior to the birth or adoption of a child of their intention to take paid parental leave benefits and would need to decide whether to take one two or three months they d also need to give their employers 30 days written notice of their intention to take paid leave to qualify applicants would need to have worked four of the past four quarters five of the past six quarters or have worked a minimum of 20 total quarters to receive benefits the parental leave benefits would be calculated using social security s current disability insurance formula ultimately for each month of parental leave benefits taken by an applicant their social security claiming date would be postponed by two months thus taking three months of parental leave would require a six month wait before claiming social security benefits once eligible we ve seen similar legislation before if all of this sounds somewhat familiar it s because a paid parental leave bill tied to social security was also introduced last year last year sen marco rubio r fla introduced legislation the economic security for new parents act that he d worked on with president trump s daughter ivanka to give parents the option of funding their paid leave by drawing early on a portion of their social security benefits rubio s plan was designed to replace about 50 to 80 of working wages with each month of paid family leave delaying the start of social security retirement benefits by three months thus a two month leave would result in a six month delay to starting retirement benefits rubio s provision also included the ability for two parent households to transfer their benefit to their spouse for instance one parent could choose to take two weeks of paid parental leave while the other parent utilizes their own four weeks plus an additional two weeks from their spouse for a total of six weeks as with the cradle act the economic security for new parents act would require advanced notification be given to the social security administration and employers and that applicants meet certain work eligibility requirements this is a terrible idea although the united states is the only country in the organization for economic cooperation and development not to offer paid parental leave and clearly something should be done to fix that the idea of allowing parents to essentially take out a loan against their future social security benefits is nothing short of terrible one of the biggest problems with providing parental leave benefits tied to social security is that the program doesn t have the ability in its current state to lend out a substantial amount of benefits the trustees report has suggested that outlays will outweigh revenue collection very soon with the program s 2 9 trillion in asset reserves projected to disappear by 2034 lending out money for parental leave benefits would put the program in an even more precarious position parental leave benefits tied to social security may threaten economic growth and productivity as well even though these benefits would be paid via social security rather than by an employer thus saving that employer money an extended absence for a key worker might result in reduced output or productivity for a company furthermore an analysis from the urban institute of rubio s bill estimates that social security wouldn t recoup around 25 of the loans from a parental leave program as people die before reaching their claiming age receive disability insurance or simply don t work enough to reach the 40 lifetime credits needed for a retired worker benefit whether it s the cradle act rubio s bill or any other number of ideas that have been floated on capitol hill borrowing against future social security income to cover a few months of paid parental leave is a terrible idea
