1q2018 the increase in revenues was mainly driven by i an increase in the exchange rate for the 1q2019 higher than the inflation for the period which impacted tariffs set in us dollars in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during the twelve month period ended on march 31 2019 the foreign exchange rate increased 115 while the inflation rate for the same period was 55 ii an increase in fuel remuneration for units under energía base regulatory framework and other related concepts which amounted to ps 2 528 million during the 1q2019 mainly because of income in accordance to res 70 18 in some of the units under the energía base regulatory framework see factors affecting our results of operations our revenues the energía base compared to ps 245 million during the 1q2018 iii a 540 increase in the sales under contracts which amounted to 518 million during the 1q2019 as compared to ps 81 million in the 1q2018 mainly due to the energy generation of wind farms achiras and la castellana which started operation during the 3q2018 and iv ps 83 million in the 1q2019 from revenues from the cvo thermal plant management which started operations on march 20 2018 this was partially offset by the decrease in energy and power prices for units under the energy base regulatory framework established by res 1 19 see section a highlights starting on march 1 2019 gross profit increased 75 to ps 2 585 million compared to ps 1 475 million in 1q2018 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in revenues which was partially offset by an increase in costs of sales that totaled ps 3 651 million a 163 increase as compared to ps 1 386 million in the 1q2018 the increase in the cost of sales was primarily driven by i an increase in the purchase of fuel and related concepts which totaled ps 2 306 million during the 1q2019 as compared to ps 356 million in the 1q2018 due to a the cost of the self supplied fuel purchased in accordance to res 70 18 described above b a higher price of natural gas used in the units that generate steam or electric energy under the energía plus framework mainly due an increase in the exchange rate for 2018 that was higher than the inflation for the period which impacted in the us dollars denominated price of natural gas in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during the twelve month period ended on march 31 2019 the foreign exchange rate increased 115 while the inflation rate for the same period was 55 ii a 34 increase in non fuel related costs of production which totaled ps 1 394 million in the 1q2019 as compared to ps 1 042 million in the 1q2018 mainly due to i a 61 increase in maintenance costs totaling ps 169 million and ii a 59 increase in depreciations due to the increase in property plant and equipment related to the new thermal and renewable energy projects gross profit margin reached 41 during 1q2019 as compared to 52 in the 1q2018 this change was mainly related to the effect of res 70 18 which increased both the income and the cost of energy production from thermal units operating income before other operating results net increased 84 to ps 2 130 million compared to ps 1 155 million in the 1q2018 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in gross profits and ii a less than proportional increase in administrative and selling expenses that totaled ps 455 million a 42 increase as compared to ps 320 million in the 1q2018 this increase was mainly driven by i a 73 increase in taxes on bank account transactions due to increased revenues costs and capital expenditures completed during the period ii a 27 increase in compensation to employees mainly due to a higher profit sharing bonds for the personnel pursuant to section 33 of the bylaws related to the net income during 2018 as compared to 2017 and iii ps 57 million in maintenance expenses mainly as a result of civil works conducted on the office buildings conducted during the 1q2019 adjusted ebitda was ps 5 486 million in the 1q2019 compared to ps 14 476 million in the 1q2018 which included a ps 12 315 million gain during the 1q2018 from a one time gain from the cvo commercial operation approval the cvo effect without taking into account this extraordinary gain the result of increase would have been 154 this variation was driven by i the increase in operating results before other operating income net mentioned above ii ps 2 917 million during the 1q2019 as compared to ps 506 million from the foreign exchange difference and interest accrued on the trade receivables denominated in us dollars mainly from foni trade receivables iv the increase in depreciations and amortizations which totaled ps 472 million during the 1q2019 as compared to ps 329 million in the 1q2018 consolidated net income was ps 1 230 million or ps 0 82 per share in the 1q2019 compared to ps 10 900 million or ps 7 25 per share in the 1q2018 which included a ps 12 315 million gain during the 1q2018 from a one time gain from the cvo commercial operation approval the cvo effect in addition to the above mentioned factors net income was i negatively impacted by higher financial expenses that amounted to ps 1 474 million in the 1q2019 compared to ps 672 million in the 1q2018 and ii positively impacted by higher financial income which amounted to ps 382 million during the 1q2019 compared to ps 265 million in the 1q2018 in each case under i and ii mainly due to the foreign exchange difference over us dollar denominated debt and financial assets which excludes foni and other trade receivables additionally the results from discontinued operation during 1q2018 when the la plata plant was sold were ps 309 million and the results from the share of profit of associates decreased to ps 97 million in the 1q2019 as compared to ps 164 million in the 1q2018 mainly due to weaker results from the operations of ecogas finally loss from exposure to the change in the purchasing power of the currency totaled ps 1 334 million during the 1q2019 as compared to ps 310 million in the 1q2018 foni collections increased to ps 813 million in

2 861 million in the 1q2018 the increase in revenues was mainly driven by i an increase in the exchange rate for the 1q2019 higher than the inflation for the period which impacted tariffs set in us dollars in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during the twelve month period ended on march 31 2019 the foreign exchange rate increased 115 while the inflation rate for the same period was 55 ii an increase in fuel remuneration for units under energía base regulatory framework and other related concepts which amounted to ps 2 528 million during the 1q2019 mainly because of income in accordance to res 70 18 in some of the units under the energía base regulatory framework see factors affecting our results of operations our revenues the energía base compared to ps 245 million during the 1q2018 iii a 540 increase in the sales under contracts which amounted to 518 million during the 1q2019 as compared to ps 81 million in the 1q2018 mainly due to the energy generation of wind farms achiras and la castellana which started operation during the 3q2018 and iv ps 83 million in the 1q2019 from revenues from the cvo thermal plant management which started operations on march 20 2018 this was partially offset by the decrease in energy and power prices for units under the energy base regulatory framework established by res 1 19 see section a highlights starting on march 1 2019 gross profit increased 75 to ps 2 585 million compared to ps 1 475 million in 1q2018 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in revenues which was partially offset by an increase in costs of sales that totaled ps 3 651 million a 163 increase as compared to ps 1 386 million in the 1q2018 the increase in the cost of sales was primarily driven by i an increase in the purchase of fuel and related concepts which totaled ps 2 306 million during the 1q2019 as compared to ps 356 million in the 1q2018 due to a the cost of the self supplied fuel purchased in accordance to res 70 18 described above b a higher price of natural gas used in the units that generate steam or electric energy under the energía plus framework mainly due an increase in the exchange rate for 2018 that was higher than the inflation for the period which impacted in the us dollars denominated price of natural gas in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during the twelve month period ended on march 31 2019 the foreign exchange rate increased 115 while the inflation rate for the same period was 55 ii a 34 increase in non fuel related costs of production which totaled ps 1 394 million in the 1q2019 as compared to ps 1 042 million in the 1q2018 mainly due to i a 61 increase in maintenance costs totaling ps 169 million and ii a 59 increase in depreciations due to the increase in property plant and equipment related to the new thermal and renewable energy projects gross profit margin reached 41 during 1q2019 as compared to 52 in the 1q2018 this change was mainly related to the effect of res 70 18 which increased both the income and the cost of energy production from thermal units operating income before other operating results net increased 84 to ps 2 130 million compared to ps 1 155 million in the 1q2018 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in gross profits and ii a less than proportional increase in administrative and selling expenses that totaled ps 455 million a 42 increase as compared to ps 320 million in the 1q2018 this increase was mainly driven by i a 73 increase in taxes on bank account transactions due to increased revenues costs and capital expenditures completed during the period ii a 27 increase in compensation to employees mainly due to a higher profit sharing bonds for the personnel pursuant to section 33 of the bylaws related to the net income during 2018 as compared to 2017 and iii ps 57 million in maintenance expenses mainly as a result of civil works conducted on the office buildings conducted during the 1q2019 adjusted ebitda was ps 5 486 million in the 1q2019 compared to ps 14 476 million in the 1q2018 which included a ps 12 315 million gain during the 1q2018 from a one time gain from the cvo commercial operation approval the cvo effect without taking into account this extraordinary gain the result of increase would have been 154 this variation was driven by i the increase in operating results before other operating income net mentioned above ii ps 2 917 million during the 1q2019 as compared to ps 506 million from the foreign exchange difference and interest accrued on the trade receivables denominated in us dollars mainly from foni trade receivables iv the increase in depreciations and amortizations which totaled ps 472 million during the 1q2019 as compared to ps 329 million in the 1q2018 consolidated net income was ps 1 230 million or ps 0 82 per share in the 1q2019 compared to ps 10 900 million or ps 7 25 per share in the 1q2018 which included a ps 12 315 million gain during the 1q2018 from a one time gain from the cvo commercial operation approval the cvo effect in addition to the above mentioned factors net income was i negatively impacted by higher financial expenses that amounted to ps 1 474 million in the 1q2019 compared to ps 672 million in the 1q2018 and ii positively impacted by higher financial income which amounted to ps 382 million during the 1q2019 compared to ps 265 million in the 1q2018 in each case under i and ii mainly due to the foreign exchange difference over us dollar denominated debt and financial assets which excludes foni and other trade receivables additionally the results from discontinued operation during 1q2018 when the la plata plant was sold were ps 309 million and the results from the share of profit of associates decreased to ps 97 million in the 1q2019 as compared to ps 164 million in the 1q2018 mainly due to weaker results from the operations of ecogas finally loss from exposure to the change in the purchasing power of the currency totaled ps 1 334 million during the 1q2019 as compared to ps 310 million in the 1q2018 foni collections increased to ps 813 million in the 1q2019 compared to ps 156 million in 1q2018 both including vat equivalent to approximately us 19 million and us 4 million respectively at the exchange rate as of march 31 2018 in

the exter inverted pyramid of global liquidity credit risk liquidity and gold in a recent edition of credit bubble bulletin doug noland the long time critic of contemporary monetary policy writes about the odd times in which we live from a financial perspective such a precarious time in history he laments so much crazy talk has drowned out the reasonable deficits don t matter so why not a trillion or two for infrastructure our federal government posted a 691 billion deficit through the first six months of the fiscal year running 15 above the year ago level yet no amount of supply will ever impact treasury prices period a federal reserve governor nominee taking a shot at growth phobiacs within the fed s temple of secrecy while saying growth can easily reach 3 to 4 5 might be a stretch larry kudlow saying the fed might not raise rates again during his lifetime little wonder highly speculative global markets have become obsessed with the plausible in that essay noland goes on to note having been influenced by the highly regarded dr kurt richebacher 1918 2007 although he actually worked directly with the austrian economist banker my connection came only as an appreciative reader of the richebacher letter in pre internet times and his wall street journal editorials richebacher concerned himself regularly with the interplay between financial market credit leverage ordinary investors and the real economy please see international precious metals commodities fair munich germany transcript of dr kurt richebächer s lecture usagold november 19 2005 in re reading that lecture i am struck with how much of richebacher s analysis at the time can be applied to the present and a very similar set of circumstances now that noland has acknowledged richebacher s influence it explains to a large degree why his writings like the snippet above strike a chord with those of us concerned with the financialization of the markets in this context we reproduce at the top john exter s famed inverted pyramid of global liquidity exter who was an economist at the federal reserve and highly respected analyst made a fortune by purchasing gold just before richard nixon s devaluation of the dollar in 1971 and its rapid ascent in the ensuing decade his pyramid explains capital wealth advisor s lewis johnson stands upon its apex of gold which has no counter party risk nor credit risk and is very liquid as you work higher into the pyramid the assets get progressively less creditworthy and less liquid for instance paper money here means cash which is recognized everywhere but is ultimately dependent upon the creditworthiness of the u s government farther up the pyramid we find longer dated u s government debt which like cash is dependent upon the full faith and credit of the u s government but on a longer time horizon the next level is debt of municipals and corporations whose value is more safely assured than that of more junior claims such as investments in stocks the junior tranche of a corporation s capital structure a rough estimate of the global liquid financial markets would place their value close to 100 trillion this number grows further still as less liquid assets are added such as private businesses real estate and ultimately bank derivatives the largest and murkiest of all assets in a credit crisis he concludes this bloated structure pancakes back down upon itself in a flight to safety the riskier upper parts of the inverted pyramid become less liquid harder to sell and if they can be sold at all change hands at markedly lower prices as the once continuous flow of credit that had levitated those prices dries up in short what lewis johnson outlines is the bottom line rationale for diversifying one s portfolio with gold u s gold bar and coin demand up 38 over last year map courtesy of the world gold council the world gold council reports u s bar and coin demand rose 38 over the past year through the first quarter global central banks and financial institutions drove physical gold demand the past 12 months raising once again the question if professional investors know something that retail investors do not as the map above illustrates the united states ranked at the top globally for growth in gold coin and bullion demand over the past year while asian demand fell back most of the u s demand as previously mentioned originated with funds and institutions not individual private investors here s the world gold council s summary of demand trends through the first quarter of 2019 central banks bought 145 5t of gold the largest q1 increase in global reserves since 2013 diversification and a desire for safe liquid assets were the main drivers of buying here on a rolling four quarter basis gold buying

morgan asset management released a report recently ranking investments over the past twenty years it shows gold as the second best performer over the period at a 7 7 average gain annually reits real estate investment trusts were number one at a 9 9 gain stocks ranked fourth at 5 6 why a 60 65 stock market loss would be run of the mill though the presence of bearish sentiment on stocks is widely acknowledged it is also generally ignored too many believe that even if the stock market tumbles it will quickly recover as it did after the 2007 2008 credit debacle there is another scenario the 1929 example where the market does not return to peak values for decades see chart below one might view the very comparison of present stock market conditions to 1929 market peak as exaggerated and preposterous but then one would be wrong says john hussman of hussman funds the fact is that on the valuation measures we find most strongly correlated with actual subsequent long term and full cycle market returns across history and even in recent decades current market valuations match or exceed those observed at the 1929 peak chart courtesy of macrotrends com why the u s needs to encourage americans to hold gold we have always believed that citizen ownership of physical gold is in the national best interest not just the best interest of its accumulators in the event of a worldwide economic breakdown or a realignment of the global monetary system it would be good for the country to have a storehouse of gold held by the populace china encourages citizen gold ownership for precisely that reason with a growing number of countries encouraging their central banks and citizens to acquire gold writes the federalist s sean fieler it is increasingly reasonable to assume that gold will be part of the world s monetary future not just its past the u s treasury should embrace policies that will attract more of the world s gold to america and better position our citizens and our nation for whatever the monetary future may hold german citizens own a staggering 8918 tonnes of gold along these lines bullion star s ronan manly published a stunning revelation that the german people have accumulated a staggering hoard of gold 8918 tonnes a hoard larger than that held by the united states government the german central bank owns another 3370 tonnes the second largest official sector holding after the united states in reading manly s analysis we were reminded of the old aphorism those own the gold make the rules while the chinese and indian populations are well known for their insatiable appetite for importing buying and hoarding physical gold he says there is one market in the west that does likewise but which flies under the radar slightly garnering less attention than china and india that gold market is germany although german citizens are known for their fondness for holding gold the vast size of the german population s gold holdings was clarified recently in a newly published survey commissioned by reisebank a bank active in the german precious metals market american eagle bullion coin sales up sharply over last year the u s mint reports sales of american eagle gold and silver bullion coins running well ahead of last year s pace at the end of april gold eagle sales were up 49 6 over the first four months of last year silver eagle sales were up 35 2 over the same period month over month gold eagle sales were nearly double the sales from april of last year silver eagle sales were up 31 over march of last year many analysts consider bullion coin sales a bellwether for overall interest in the precious metals among investors this year s strong uptick over last year indicates increased activity among american investors interested in including gold and silver in their holdings as safe haven hedges and an underpriced asset class oecd indicator flashing danger ahead the organization for economic co operation and development oecd measures consumer confidence in various economies including the united states a reading above 100 indicates a positive outlook toward the future economic situation values below 100 reflect a more pessimistic outlook as you can see we are now at a level in consumer confidence that has signaled downturns in the past in fact consumer confidence is now ahead of where it was just before the 2008 2009 recession and just below the level it registered before the dot com stock market bust in 2000 why gold could rise for the next ten years bert dohmen editor of the wellington letter called the twenty year bear market in gold that began in 1981 and ended in 2001 now in forbes article he reminds us not only of that call but the one that went with it the second part of our forecast in 1981 said that according to our very long term cycle study that bear market would be followed by a 30 year rise in gold we even said we had no idea what would cause it but the cycles said it should happen if the forecast i made in 1981 still holds true gold could have a continued secular bull market until 2030 that means the gold bull market could have about 11 more years to go historically the final phase of a bull market is the most spectacular the lesson is one as old as the gold market itself the best time to buy is when the market is quiet a strategy that requires both discipline and conviction as an old friend and client of usagold used to say he passed away years ago it is not a question of if but when he accumulated a large hoard of the metal in the 1990s and early 2000s between 300 and 600 per ounce and lived to see his prediction come true his estate though was the ultimate beneficiary of his wisdom he was not one to sell gold once he had acquired it we chatted regularly on the phone back then and i told him that i had used the story just told in one of my newsletters he was in his late 80s at the time tell them he said resolutely that i bought my first ounce of gold at 35 7 notablequotable this single cosmic event close to our solar system gave birth to 0 3 percent of the earth s heaviest elements including gold platinum and uranium this means that in each of us we would find an eyelash worth of these elements mostly in the form of iodine which is essential to life bartos said carla cantor columbia news editor s note and economists wonder why humanity has a dogged attachment to the barbarous relic was it carl sagan who used to say that we are made of star stuff gold should be about 15 higher over the next year and the basic reason is that eventually the us dollar is going to stop going up at the same time with all these trade wars and confrontations between major powers of the world russia china the united states there is a case for diversification away from dollars and the central banks are doing that one of the things they are diversifying into is gold i would say we like gold in the commodity space mark matthews julius baer presently cryptocurrencies seem to be marred by intellectual contradictions why does anyone think for example that crypto is a good payment mechanism or store of value when transactions are clunky and the value of a bitcoin has swung from 20 000 to 5 000 in the past 18 months gillian tett financial times all of the fed s tools are failing to halt a race to buy physical gold as insurance and there is only one source of no counterparty risk insurance that can hedge against a meltdown and preserve capital and that is physical gold and silver this insurance is now so artificially depressed that natural forces alone will cause the price of gold to rise rapidly andrew maguire london metals trader and analyst at king world news federal reserve officials are considering a new program that would allow banks to exchange treasurys for reserves a move aimed at ensuring liquidity during difficult times that also would help the central bank decrease the size of its nearly 4 trillion balance sheet in some quarters the idea is viewed as a natural extension of current fed policy others though think it in essence could be a repackaged form of quantitative easing and thus yet another iteration of the fed s decade long tinkering in financial markets jeff cox cnbc i m adamant that even the most diehard gold bug should have some capital in the us stock market bonds and real estate even if it s just 10 of a gold bug s portfolio it s important for all investors to hedge their bets stewart thompson 321gold financialization is the smiley face perversion of smith s invisible hand and schumpeter s creative destruction it is a profoundly repressive political equilibrium that masks itself in the common knowledge of yay capitalism financialization is a global phenomenon in china it s transmitted through the real estate market in the us it s transmitted through the stock market financialization is the zombiefication of an economy and the oligarchification of a society ben hunt epsilon theory the 7 increase in price that is forecast to occur if it will materialize will be the beginning of a sustained silver price boom which might last decades the supply demand dynamics make it imperative for this to happen which is why i have been steadily buying physical silver in the past few years zoltan ban seeking alpha editor s note we will remind our readers too that when silver moves to the upside it tends to move in grand fashion they are snapping up the metal at the fastest rate in almost half a century in a trend that looks set to continue over the 12 months through march 31 they purchased a whopping 715 7 metric tons of gold bullion worth around 29 4 billion according to a recently published report from the industry group world gold council simon constable the street xi said china would keep the chinese currency stable within a reasonable range but would not engage in any beggar thy neighbour currency devaluation one of the criticisms of the us towards china amid concerns that china had failed to live up to its reform pledges xi said china treasures its promises and commitments with a thousand taels of gold teddy ng and lee jeung ho south china morning post tsaklanos expects the gold market to build up energy during the summer any breakthrough he predicts is likely going to happen in october or november and it would pave the way to 1 550 myra saefong marketwatch financial professionals frequently opine that asset prices are a function of economic conditions assets like stocks bonds and real estate rise in value when the economy is expanding they fall in value when the economy contracts the problem with those statements is that they represent a flawed understanding of 21st century credit cycles in particular recessionary pressures did not cause the tech wreck 2000 2002 nor the housing collapse 2008 2009 rather the bursting of each asset bubble sparked the recession that followed gary gordon seeking alpha congressional republicans are led on a short leash by a president who as a candidate vowed to not touch entitlement programs that are significant drivers of the deficit and who breezily promised to eliminate the national debt currently 22 trillion in eight years today that would mean eight reductions of 2 75 trillion a sum equal to 63 of the fiscal 2019 budget republicans now thoroughly disarmed concerning the issue of fiscal probity struggle to frighten the 2020 electorate with the specter of spendthrift socialists threatening the republic george will triblive in our business there is no place for certainty with that in mind i like to quote henry kaufman who was the chief economist at salomon brothers he said that two kinds of people lose a lot of money those who know nothing and those who know everything so at best the

editor of the wellington letter called the twenty year bear market in gold that began in 1981 and ended in 2001 now in forbes article he reminds us not only of that call but the one that went with it the second part of our forecast in 1981 said that according to our very long term cycle study that bear market would be followed by a 30 year rise in gold we even said we had no idea what would cause it but the cycles said it should happen if the forecast i made in 1981 still holds true gold could have a continued secular bull market until 2030 that means the gold bull market could have about 11 more years to go historically the final phase of a bull market is the most spectacular the lesson is one as old as the gold market itself the best time to buy is when the market is quiet a strategy that requires both discipline and conviction as an old friend and client of usagold used to say he passed away years ago it is not a question of if but when he accumulated a large hoard of the metal

had acquired it we chatted regularly on the phone back then and i told him that i had used the story just told in one of my newsletters he was in his late 80s at the time tell them he said resolutely

artificially depressed that natural forces alone will cause the price of gold to rise rapidly andrew maguire london metals trader and analyst at king world news federal reserve officials are considering a new program that would allow banks to exchange treasurys for reserves a move aimed at ensuring liquidity during difficult times that also would help the central bank decrease the size of

cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war mark antony in william shakespeare s play julius caesar investors now confront the dogs of trade war and they re destructive beasts indeed the u s last friday imposed a fresh round of tariffs against china on 200 billion worth of imported goods yesterday china retaliated with its own set of tariffs against the u s on 60 billion worth of goods china vowed to never surrender in the trade war which doesn t bode well for wall street s hopes of a truce the result has been a steep decline in global stock markets over the past several days with intense volatility you should expect stocks to remain on a roller coaster for an extended period of time as trade rhetoric periodically hits equities and investors turn around to buy on the dips below i ll provide two steps that can protect your portfolio from trade war but which also tap growth opportunities the high stakes of trade war the following chart shows the enormous stakes involved and explains why investors are crying havoc over tariffs as the chart shows the u s trade deficit with china reached a record high of 419 2 billion in 2018 but that s not necessarily a bad trend it s not as if that money were lost anyone who says tariffs are necessary because of the trade deficit simply doesn t understand trade or is being purposely dishonest the increase in the deficit actually reflects american strength as a strong u s economy and a strong dollar boost demand in the u s for chinese goods to be sure the u s imports more than it exports particularly manufactured goods but the u s government s trade numbers can be misleading because they tend to emphasize lower skilled manufacturing jobs and underestimate the importance of value added services in the services sector which tends to generate higher paying jobs than in manufacturing the u s ran a 244 billion trade surplus last year don t we want america to be an incubator for skilled jobs rather than low paying unskilled ones the vast majority of economists decry tariffs as dangerous of course you ll find a few pseudo economists on cnbc who ll defend tariffs some of these talking heads even get hired by the government where they can really do damage however economic experts who actually know what they re talking about condemn protectionism they say tariffs raise the cost of goods reduce output destroy jobs and exacerbate geopolitical tensions history proves their case what s more these tariffs are disrupting thousands of supply chains around the world making life miserable for corporate planners republican leaders in congress strongly oppose protectionism opening a rift between trump and the establishment wing of his party most democrats oppose tariffs too but trump s protectionist rhetoric will probably get more inflammatory to appeal to his base as the 2020 elections loom the ghost of smoot hawley the ghost of smoot hawley now haunts financial markets protectionists must have skipped economics class on the day that smoot hawley was taught a quick refresher course sponsored by senator reed smoot and representative willis c hawley the tariff act of 1930 commonly known as smoot hawley was signed into law by president herbert hoover on june 17 1930 the act raised u s tariffs on over 20 000 imported goods the tariffs sparked a ruinous global trade war that sank the world deeper into a depression that lasted 10 years what eventually got the world out of the great depression demand for production workers caused by the outbreak of world war ii hoover spurned a petition to the white house from more than 1 000 economists urging him to veto the legislation likewise trump has ignored the pleas of the financial community to not follow through on his tariffs the deeper problem here is that trade wars often erupt into shooting wars stay cautious investors face perilous times two appealing assets now amid this troubling backdrop two assets currently provide protection combined with outsized potential small capitalization stocks and gold you should increase your exposure to both here s why rise of the small fry the definition of small cap varies but it s generally a company with a market capitalization of between 300 million and 2 billion large cap stocks are getting whipsawed by trade war headlines one way to protect your portfolio is to buy high quality small cap stocks especially in sectors that benefit during the late stage of economic recovery e g consumer staples health care energy and utilities small caps disproportionately benefit from economic and earnings growth both of which have been resilient this year small business confidence also has been high due to the trump administration s business friendly regulatory and tax policies small caps are insulated from concerns about global growth because they tend to get most of their revenue domestically trade conflict and increasing instability in emerging markets have driven investors to smaller stocks which have less exposure to these overseas risks the yellow metal is poised to shine during the escalating trade war the power the u s has to implement tariffs stems from the dollar s status as a reserve currency however china has been accumulating a vast hoard of gold if this storehouse of the yellow metal becomes big enough it could give china the leverage to break the greenback s primacy there are signs that china seeks to promote the yuan as a national currency to rival the dollar a development that would be bullish for gold rising inflation and multiple crises at home and abroad as well as china s efforts to promote the yuan should significantly boost the yellow metal over the long haul adding to international instability is the massive amount of private and public debt that s sloshing around the globe the international monetary fund imf in april released its global financial stability report revealing that non financial corporate leverage in the u s is at its highest level relative to gross domestic product gdp since before the great financial crisis of 2008 political instability is on the rise too the agonies of brazil venezuela turkey and other nations not to mention the brexit mess are probably only a taste of what s to come all of these trends are bullish for gold gold prices have been in a slump this year but they re ready to regain luster as investors embrace a commodity that s historically been a safe haven during times of rising inflation and geopolitical uncertainty inflation seems muted at the moment but low unemployment will probably drive wage growth in coming months which in turn will exert upward pressure on prices another inflationary ingredient tariffs which increase the cost of goods and prompt companies to hike retail prices questions about

after months of difficult negotiations islamabad and the international monetary fund imf declared on sunday that they had reached an agreement on a fresh bailout package for pakistan if the deal is approved by the imf s management the south asian nation will receive 6 billion 5 34 billion in financial assistance over a period of three years to stave off a balance of payments crisis abdul hafeez shaikh pakistan s de facto finance minister told the state run pakistan television that he hoped it would be his country s last bailout package from the imf read more belt and road forum is the china pakistan economic corridor failing under the deal pakistan would give up central bank control of the currency to adopt a market based exchange rate and take measures to improve the functioning of loss making state owned firms as well as curtail subsidies among other things the world bank and the asian development bank would provide up to 3 billion in additional assistance in pursuance of the imf deal hafeez shaikh said the economy of the majority muslim nation with a population of over 200 million has slid deeper into crisis since imran khan took over as prime minister last year burgeoning fiscal and current account deficits and a dip in revenues from tax collection are at the heart of the crisis pakistan is facing a challenging economic environment with lackluster growth elevated inflation high indebtedness and a weak external position ernesto ramirez rigo who led the imf mission to pakistan said in a statement on sunday the authorities recognize the need to address these challenges as well as to tackle the large informality in the economy the low spending in human capital and poverty a challenging environment through the imf bailout package pakistan will resolve its balance of payments crisis there is currently a financing gap of 12 billion and the bailout will help bridge the gap this year as well as in the coming three years minister of state for revenue hammad azhar told dw pakistan has gone to the imf numerous times since 1980 seeking bailouts the country has had a tense relationship with the lender as the conditions attached to the assistance are always unpopular pm imran khan initially appeared reluctant to approach the imf for aid fearing that it would impose tough conditions on government policy instead khan s administration sought billions of dollars in help from friendly countries including saudi arabia china and the united arab emirates to fix the nation s finances but with inflation climbing to over 8 the rupee losing a third of its value over the past year and foreign exchange reserves barely enough to cover two months of imports it was forced to turn to the imf read more the myth of austerity why pm imran khan s populism won t solve pakistan s woes growing discontent analysts have warned that any imf deal would likely come with strict conditions that could restrict pm khan s ability to fulfil his grand promises to build an islamic welfare state as the country is forced to tighten its purse strings the imf deal with the austerity measures it will entail will be a political blow to a pakistani government that had promised to build out a new welfare state michael kugelman a south asia expert at the washington based woodrow wilson center for scholars told dw the imf package will make it quite tough for khan to achieve his economic promises and therefore undercut the populist image that he has sought to showcase to the electorate he added khan came to power last year after promising to improve the country s economy and provide jobs to people this view is shared by kaiser bengali a renowned economist in pakistan the imf has an agenda to privatize the assets of the country which will lead to massive unemployment said the expert the bailout announcement comes as discontent is already growing over measures khan s government has taken to fend off the crisis including devaluing the rupee by some 30 since january 2018 sending inflation to five year highs khan came to power after winning a simple majority in last year s parliamentary elections on promises to improve the country s economy and provide jobs to people but his critics say his government has so far not been able to honor his commitment to the masses a government report published on friday also noted that pakistan s growth rate is set to hit an eight year low with the country s gdp rate likely to sink to 3 3 t against a projected target of 6 2 read more china pledges aid to pakistan amid financial crisis but some observers say the imf package will be beneficial to end the growing uncertainty and build investor confidence the deal will put an end to uncertainty and improve pakistan s financial situation abid sulehri an economist told dw even though it might have some negative effects in the form of a rise in inflation it will produce positive results in the long run us support when asked why china didn t come to pakistan s rescue minister azhar said china has already been providing funding for pakistan s trade and infrastructure development and we opted for the imf funding so as to introduce structural reforms in the economy the united states which has tremendous influence over the imf warned last year that any potential international bailout for pakistan should not provide funds to pay off chinese lenders make no mistake we will be watching what the imf does us secretary of state mike pompeo said there s no rationale for imf tax dollars and associated with that american dollars that are part of the imf funding for those to go to bail out chinese bondholders or china itself pompeo added it s not yet clear if the bailout agreement reached on sunday enjoys washington s backing pakistan s crisis also comes as the country is facing possible sanctions from the financial action task force an anti money laundering monitor based in paris for failing to rein in terror financing the organization will soon decide whether to add pakistan to a blacklist that would trigger automatic sanctions further weakening its already faltering economy

zcl on april 2 2019 the company completed the acquisition of zcl that the company previously announced on january 20 2019 the company acquired all of the shares of zcl by way of a statutory plan of

facility was used to fund the acquisition of zcl and will be used for other general corporate purposes on march 7 2019 shawcor also repaid its senior notes debt including accrued interest and make whole payment in the total amount of us 205 million 1 1 outlook shawcor s financial performance is correlated with oil and gas infrastructure spending and the resultant demand for the company s products and services adjusted ebitda1 for the first quarter of 2019 was marginally softer than expected due to ongoing weakness in western canada which resulted in lower demand for small diameter line pipe coating joint protection and tubular inspection services in this market the first quarter results reflected continued demand for composite products in the united states and girth weld inspection services for large diameter pipelines and international projects along with ongoing investments in the pipe coating business for idle assets and project pursuit costs in preparation for the expected increase in activity in late 2019 and beyond the first quarter results support the company s continued expectation that 2019 will be a year of two halves where the results of the second half of the year will be an improvement over the first half although the 2019 annual results excluding the positive impact of the zcl acquisition are still expected to be an improvement over 2018 individual quarterly performance will be dependent on the continued strength of our base business particularly in the u s and the timing of when pipe coating activity will improve the company s base business in north america is heavily tied to the spending programs of exploration and production operators in western canada limited off take capacity in the region caused by the lack of new pipeline infrastructure is resulting in depressed spending the first quarter results were negatively impacted by a decline in activity that was greater than expected and unusually low compared to historical performance this market is not expected to improve until off take is addressed in the us land operators are shifting from strategies to add production volumes to ones that now include capital discipline and generating returns for shareholders this principle shift has the potential to result in a disconnect between operator drilling and completion spending and commodity price movements and operators maintaining higher cash balances than the past although the first quarter results benefitted from strong us land activity and the company s diversified portfolio of products and services is well positioned to support its customers in this market there is short term uncertainty in how the company will be impacted by this change in operator strategy the company continues to see signs of positive momentum in the offshore global oil gas capex cycle from the low point experienced in 2018 and believes that this market is poised for growth in late 2019 and beyond as evidenced by the level of our current bids outstanding the likelihood of large projects being sanctioned in the near to medium term remains strong these investments are required to replace maintain and rehabilitate infrastructure that is at or beyond its useful design life replace production due to reservoir depletion and address geopolitical challenges which are affecting several important producing regions additionally higher investments in gas specifically lng are being supported by the increased global demand for greener technology the company remains well positioned to capitalize on this continuing positive trend in project activity through its global footprint technology portfolio and execution history during the quarter the company continued its strategic efforts to position itself as the partner of choice in the pursuit of several large projects which are characterized as greater than 100 million in revenue operators continue the trend of engaging large global engineering procurement construction epc companies to standardize engineering approaches and lower overall costs as part of this process epc s are selecting preferred suppliers to participate in the planning process significantly earlier than in the past in order to ensure greater certainty of execution and costs this new model has allowed the company to work with several epc s on multiple projects and provide greater visibility on future project wins in advance of final investment decisions the project win of liza i and ii in the fourth quarter of 2018 is an example of this new contracting model and the company expects to win additional conditional awards in the near term under the same model 1 ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap measures and do not have standardized meanings under gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures provided by other companies see section 6 0 reconciliation of non gaap measures for further details and a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda although the exact timing of when large projects are sanctioned is difficult to predict the company believes that there is still a strong likelihood that some of these projects will be sanctioned in 2019 and beyond as they are more linked to energy security or reservoir access considerations than current oil and gas commodity prices the company expects that higher pipe coating activity in the second half of 2019 will assist in delivering improved annual operating results over 2018 stronger results in 2020 are possible from the build in backlog that the company believes it will realize in 2019 with confidence in the expected increase in pipe coating activity in the second half of 2019 the further strengthening in 2020 and the continued strength of our diversified base business the company continued its growth strategy with the acquisition of zcl composites inc north america s largest manufacturer and supplier of environmentally friendly fiberglass reinforced plastic underground storage tanks this investment was aligned with our long term fundamental drivers such as aging infrastructure and it leverages shawcor s material science expertise in advanced composite materials to provide customers with superior systems for both their transmission and storage needs it further demonstrates shawcor s continued commitment to diversify its portfolio and increase its base business to provide a foundation for long term investments in technology developments and profitable base business growth significant integration efforts are underway and annualized run rate cost synergies by the end of the first year are now estimated at over 8 million which is double the amount previously communicated in addition to the cost benefits the combination of zcl and shawcor has increased the addressable market for the company as a whole this additional market will be addressed through synergies that improve the distribution channels to the market the linking of discrete components into systems such as pipe and tank and leveraging the company s global footprint to extend the reach of tank technology while still in the early stages this additional addressable market will provide another lever for the company s growth in the future further detail on the outlook for the pipeline and pipe services segment by region and in the petrochemical and industrial segment is set out below pipeline and pipe services segment north america market demand in shawcor s north american pipeline segment businesses is closely tied to well completions and the build out of new and the repair replacement of old transmission pipeline infrastructure these activities drive the demand for small diameter pipe coating and joint protection composite pipe for gathering line applications octg pipe inspection and refurbishment and gathering line girth weld inspection the softness experienced in western canada in the first quarter is expected to continue as off take capacity remains limited and there is no certainty of new pipeline infrastructure being built although demand in north american land activity is expected to resume in the second half of 2019 when take away capacity constraints in the permian are addressed through several transmission pipeline projects currently underway activity levels in the near term may be challenged due to lower customer spending resulting from the greater focus on acquisitions and capital discipline the increased breadth of the company s portfolio as well as the continued adoption rate of shawcor s composite pipe systems technology over traditional steel products is helping to absorb some of these headwinds in addition the company continues to experience strong demand for its pipe coating capabilities from increased activity in the gulf of mexico and larger diameter onshore transmission line projects which is improving the utilization of our u s based coating facilities pipeline and pipe services segment latin america the company continues to expect increased activity in the recently reactivated facilities in mexico and brazil related to the continued activity in the gulf of mexico and smaller offshore brazilian projects this is supported by the liza ii project that is now under contract which is expected to be executed in the company s veracruz facility and contribute positive results in the second half of 2019 pipeline and pipe services segment europe middle east africa and russia emar shawcor s emar pipeline region continues to be negatively impacted by reduced capital spending by national and international energy companies the company will continue executing work on the awarded contract to provide anti corrosion and concrete weight coatings related to an offshore qatar pipeline the company continues to pursue several large projects in the region that if won could provide significant work beyond 2019 pipeline and pipe services segment asia pacific the region s project activity will continue to be depressed due to the lack of offshore project investments although the company believes activity levels will increase slightly in late 2019 greater contributions from pipe coating activity are expected beyond 2019 from several large projects that could be awarded in 2019 which are related to the development of gas reservoirs petrochemical and industrial segment shawcor s petrochemical and industrial segment businesses continue to deliver solid revenue and operating income supported by the stable european and north american industrial markets and despite some softening of european and china automotive markets these markets generally follow gdp activity however the segment continues to be well positioned to capture the growing trend of electronic content in automobiles with specified sealing insulating and customized application equipment systems for tier 1 assembly customers demand for wire and cable products continues to be strong and supply chain constraints for drawn wire from copper rods has stabilized from the fourth quarter of 2018 order backlog the company s order backlog consists of firm customer orders only and represents the revenue the company expects to realize on booked orders over the succeeding twelve months the company reports the twelve month billable backlog because it provides a leading indicator of significant changes in consolidated revenue the order backlog of 454 million as at march 31 2019 excluding zcl s orders was basically in line with the 459 million order backlog as at december 31 2018 this reflects revenue generated in the quarter from backlog orders which was mostly offset by new orders on the base business and other project wins moving from bid to backlog in addition to the backlog the company closely monitors its bidding activity and the value of outstanding firm bids is over 1 1 billion as at march 31 2019 up slightly from last quarter due to increasing bidding activity for pipe coating in the offshore and international markets included in the firm bid but not in the backlog is the recently announced 30 million tortue project award and unsanctioned conditional awards between epc companies and shawcor for a scope of work that is estimated at over 150 million in revenue beyond 2019 the company is also working with customers on a number of other projects and the budgetary estimates at the end of the first quarter remain strong at almost 1 9 billion although the timing of these projects is uncertain the company s bid and budgetary figures represent a diverse portfolio of opportunities to sustain and build the backlog through 2019 and beyond 2 0 consolidated information and results from operations 2 1 revenue the following table sets forth revenue by reportable operating segment for the following periods

well as to determine compliance with debt covenants and to manage its capital structure these non gaap measures do not have standardized meanings under ifrs and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures provided by other companies the company discloses these measures because it believes that they provide further information and assist readers in understanding the results of the company s operations and financial position these measures should not be considered in isolation or used in substitution for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap the

supplemental measures that provide a meaningful indication of the company s results from principal business activities prior to the consideration of how these activities are financed or the tax impacts in various jurisdictions and for comparing its operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing capital or tax structures the company presents adjusted ebitda as a measure of ebitda that excludes the impact of transactions that are outside the company s normal course of business or day to day operations adjusted ebitda is used by many analysts in the oil and gas industry as one of several important analytical tools to evaluate financial performance and is a key metric in business valuations it is also considered important by

the us threat and then imposition of tariffs on a wide array of chinese imports and the potential assignment of duties on all mainland goods have sent equity markets around the globe screaming lower the reaction of the currency markets has been less than excited the dollar has lost 2 6 versus the japanese yen since april 24th and 1 9 since the close on may 3th the last trading session before president trump announced new tariffs on chinese imports that went into effect this past friday to the finish on monday the 13th the yen is one of the traditional safe haven currencies for global and specifically asian risk sought for the perceived economic and political stability of the islands against the euro the dollar has lost 19 points from the close on friday may 3rd to the finish on monday may 13th those are pricing points basis points in another market in percent it is 0 17 much closer to a price than a range the dollar is higher against the australian dollar new zealand dollar and the british pound it is a curiously indecisive and restrained move for an economic conflict that has the ability to diminish growth around the world if the trade dispute between the world s two largest economies is about to go from a skirmish to all out war the impact will not be limited to china and the united states one of the reasons the imf reduced its projection for global gdp this year from 3 7 last october the 3 3 in april was the impact in abeyance until last week that a full fledged trans pacific trade war would have on the weakly growing european and japanese economies when the federal reserve first moved to a neutral stance in january the fomc statement called for patience but chairman powell was more specific in his news conference an escalating trade dispute between china and the us was one of the risks requiring insurance china and the united states are not just the two largest economies they are also the most dynamic and far reaching china draws in resources from around the world and acts as work and assembly shop for vast numbers of consumer products the united states is the largest and wealthiest market and the premier destination for every exporter from high value manufacturers like mercedes to makers of trinkets for children and everything in between if the growth of these two giants is about to suffer its ramifications will be felt in every corner of the global economy if china and the united states slow or slip into recession there is no other economic entity on the planet that can take up the slack over the past 30 years the dollar has been the safe haven currency of choice when markets are truly panicked in the months leading to the financial crisis the dollar and dollar assets were in demand everywhere from july 2008 through november the greenback rose 20 8 against the euro 26 5 versus the sterling 21 0 against the swiss franc 23 3 versus the canadian dollar and 35 against the australian dollar the one exception was the japanese yen which rose 11 2 the current situation and the potential is not comparable the financial crisis even if the two antagonists placed tariffs on every item that each sells to the other it might push the global economy to a recession but it might not the trade dispute between the united states and china could develop into a crisis for the global trade regime that has evolved since the second world war and for china after her entry into the world trade organization wto in 2001 it could plunge the world economy into a coordinated slowdown but there are more reasons to think that it will eventually be settled than to assume ever increasing acrimony and economic dislocation economic and political logic is still on the side of negotiation and agreement that is one reason for the blasé response of the dollar the euro and their coevals markets have not lost faith in the ultimate deal for international companies that have large operations in china the damage from the dispute is real and aimed directly at their bottom line the collapse in equities assigns lower value to those companies whose prospects are damaged by the dispute reuters that brings us to the second reason currency markets seem agnostic it is not clear whose economy would fare best in a protracted trade war or even the end of wto regulations given past performance it would probably be the united states rather than china europe or japan its large internal market and small dependence on exports leaves its economic growth less beholden to global trends the fed s interest rate policy over the last four years has left it with a much greater ability to stimulate the economy should it become necessary if and when the us china trade negations break down the dollar will resume its historical safe haven status and it will be aided by us economic growth the dollar is not flying because the circumstances do not as yet warrant it
postelection turkey needs to take tangible measures to restore economic stability and government credibility and strengthen domestic capital markets recep tayyip erdogan s combative decision to turn the march 31 local elections into a referendum on his presidency was always set to be a high stakes move unsurprisingly the campaign was bitter the governing justice and development party ak party and its allies claimed turkey s very survival was at stake it accused the secular republican people s party chp and its allies of being in thrall to foreign interests nobody expected the whole electoral process to backfire so dramatically turkey s main metropolitan centers including antalya adana and significantly the capital ankara fell to the opposition most poignant for erdogan was losing his home city of istanbul where he started his career and which he used as a launchpad as mayor to break into national politics the political map of turkey now shows similarities with that of the us with the chp like us democrats holding the more developed coastal areas while the ak party and allies like the us gop reign supreme in the rural interior some 51 of voters supported the ruling ak party coalition versus around 38 who supported chp this suggests that although erdogan remains by far the most powerful political figure in turkey the opposition is gaining traction how did this happen erdogan s liberal critics voiced opposition to his growing authoritarianism and concern over his various spats with the eu and the us yet most of those who turned against erdogan did so for a more mundane reason the economy turkey has yet to recover from the tumultuous days of last august when a sudden tariff war with the us sent the turkish lira into a tailspin at one point losing 70 to hit 7 2 to the dollar compared to a rate of 4 before the crisis in mid april the lira was trading at around 5 4 lira to the us dollar a drop of more than 20 the impact on consumer and investor confidence has been dramatic leading to gdp contracting 1 6 in the third quarter of 2018 and 2 4 in the final quarter of the year total growth for 2018 was 2 6 the lowest since 2009 with unemployment reaching 13 5 by year end nearly four percentage points above year end 2017 meanwhile inflation has increased to about 20 with consumers hit the hardest to mitigate the pressure the government has opened heavily subsidized food markets in the main cities but such measures have been insufficient with consumers and businesses also impacted by increasing interest rates banks which have seen an expansion in nonperforming loans npls even though they remain low at less than 4 have become more risk averse amid the drop in asset quality and are poorly positioned to issue new loans as confidence in the lira falls dollarization has been rising foreign exchange fx deposits now make up nearly half of total deposits compared with 30 at the end of 2010 over the first two months of 2019 we saw a huge increase in demand for fx from local depositors around 16 billion says inan demir head of emerging europe the middle east and africa at nomura bank adding that reserves at the central bank of the republic of turkey were initially unaffected a further acceleration in demand over march however led to a drop in fx reserves the central bank was obliged to launch countermeasures which included restricting offshore lira liquidity in an effort to boost demand for the currency these moves raised concerns about cb transparency at a crucial time with the worry it could have a negative impact on investor sentiment demir notes analysts at moody s investors service have added their own concerns noting at the start of april that the erosion of the central bank s foreign currency reserves is concerning and that recent apparent moves by the central bank to support the lira pose renewed questions about transparency and independence these developments followed a period of reassuringly conventional central bank activity after it moved swiftly last september to boost its key interest rate 625 basis points to 24 to stem the lira s decline roger kelly the lead regional economist covering turkey romania and bulgaria at the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd says the broad policy response has been reassuring despite some lingering doubts about the central bank s independence the announcement last autumn of a new economic plan which involves better coordination of fiscal and monetary policy will also go some way toward establishing credibility he adds but most investors have been looking at the broader picture which at first glance is not encouraging indicators for first quarter 2019 do not point to a significant pick up in activity and for the full year growth is likely to be negative says demir this is in line with many other forecasters including fitch ratings which in march lowered its 2019 forecast for gdp to decline 1 1 against its earlier forecast of a 0 6 decline this is a tough time for the economy as the impact of the fall in the lira and much tighter policy settings continue to work through says paul gamble head of emerging europe at fitch ratings sovereign ratings group in london gamble believes that the economy bottomed in the first quarter but that year on year growth will remain below potential next year inflation is expected to end 2019 in the double digits albeit lower than where it is today this gloom is echoed by lawrence brainard of ts lombard an economic research house in london in a recent note to clients he argues that contrary to government claims there is little evidence that the recession is bottoming out he believes the economy faces an extended period of stagflation compounded by a deteriorating fiscal picture as expenditures continue to increase and revenues fail to pick up he says the current fiscal deficit of 2 9 understates the current fiscal shortfall pointing to the large off balance sheet liabilities associated with up to 60 billion in public private partnership projects backed by the government s credit guarantee fund he adds there are reasons to question whether official data provides an accurate picture of turkey s fiscal position president erdogan has gone out of his way to discourage the naysayers and suggests that 2019 will turn out much better than many maintain to be fair there are signs that the economic contraction is bottoming out with exports and tourism expected to have a bumper year on the back of a weaker lira and bolstered by an improved domestic security environment the opening of the new istanbul airport last october turkish airlines moved all its operations there from istanbul atatürk airport in early april this year is also expected to bolster visitor numbers the new airport is vast with a current capacity of 90 million passengers a year which will more than double to 200 million once the final phase of construction is finished in 2023 flights will go to 350 destinations around the world meanwhile trade is doing well with exporters in the manufacturing sector in particular taking advantage of the cheaper lira between january and march this year the value of exports increased by more than 3 3 to reach 44 5 billion the highest level ever with imports down more than 21 to 50 5 billion the ebrd is among those who believe turkey will experience some growth this year although its current 1 forecast is well below the 4 2 forecast the bank made last may before the currency crisis exporters have the potential to be one of the bright spots in turkey and we expect them to play an important role in any recovery later this year says kelly as the dust settles from turkey s local elections investors will be looking to erdogan and his ak party government to cool the heated political atmosphere and restore some order and predictability to the economy turkey has had a turbulent few years with the attempted august 2016 coup subsequent far reaching purges within the public and private sectors some bitterly fought elections and numerous face offs with countries it once counted among it closest allies now it has an unprecedented four and a half year window with no elections scheduled observers will be hoping the government presses ahead with its three year reform program the outlines of which were unveiled last year politics always got in the way argues gamble now investors are looking at an environment that should be conducive to the introduction of reforms that could improve the business environment and the domestic savings ratio there is some solid ground to build on last year turkey improved its position by 17 in the world bank s doing business survey to rank 43 out of 190 countries having taken some key steps to improve the business environment including reducing the amount of time needed to start a business especially given turkey s travails coupled with the general downturn in global investor sentiment fdi has held up better than expected with 13 2 billion invested last year a 14 increase over 2017 and according to the country s banking regulation and supervision agency brsa the bank sector has also remained in good shape total sector assets increased 19 4 year on year in january february of this year to reach 743 billion with net profits totaling 1 22 billion last year net profits were up 10 and reached 10 6 billion this occurred despite the highly adverse impact the lira s depreciation has had on foreign currency debt in a report issued at the end of march fitch ratings stressed the sector s capital ratios and found that its profitability and capital buffers still provide a significant cushion against a potential marked deterioration in asset quality although weaker banks will breach minimum capital levels at lower levels of stress for these institutions the ebrd s offer in early april to help turkey tackle an increase in nonperforming loans which according to the brsa reached 4 11 in february up from 2 92 in february 2018 will provide solid reassurance despite such bright spots investors over the longer term will be looking for reassurance that turkey is looking to stabilize the economy and reenergize reforms the turkish industry and business association says priorities should be returning inflation to single figures alongside strengthening institutions improving transparency in the public sector and developing the insurance sector the ebrd s roger kelly says ankara should be focusing on a wide range of priorities enhancing domestic energy security and sustainability energy imports account for a large part of the current account deficit boosting the quality of infrastructure particularly municipal and boosting competitiveness to help the economy avoid the middle income trap the government should also he says look to boost inclusion and gender equality taking into account the huge regional differences between western turkey and areas in the east particularly those far removed from the big cities turkey also needs to press ahead with strengthening domestic capital markets so locals are more easily able to borrow in lira this is key to reducing dollarization kelly says adding that the high cost of borrowing in lira has been one of the major factors holding back domestic investment as growth slowly resumes can turkey look ahead with confidence as long as something like the expected delivery of the ss 400 missile system from moscow this summer doesn t translate into another bruising deterioration in relations with washington which cost turkey so much the last time then the nation may be able to right the ship

though both sides have raised tariffs on either other imports chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said in a regular press briefing my understanding is that china and the united states have agreed to continue pursuing relevant discussions but no detail was given on the way forward geng just said as for how they are pursued i think that hinges upon further consultations between the two sides additionally geng warned we hope that the u s side does not misjudge the situation and not underestimate china s determination and will to safeguard its interests china also typically denied any accusation of their wrong doings geng said you absolutely can t put the hat on china of reversing positions and going back on one s promises trump have to make up the tremendous ground since ridiculous one sided formation of the wto trump fired a series of tweets boasting his own tariff policies again he noted there is now a big a growing steel industry after the 25 tariffs he also blamed that there were tremendous ground lost to china since the ridiculous one sided formation of the wto he also claimed that it s time for the farmers as one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now the country will make up for the differences if china doesn t continue to buy from them fed williams decline decline in r means limited policy space in future downturns in prepared remarks new york fed president john williams said the global shifts in demographics and productivity have two important implications for the economy and monetary policy firstly slower population and productivity growth translate directly into slower trend economic growth secondly these trends have contributed to dramatic declines in the longer term normal or neutral real rate of interest or r star and the global decline in r star will continue to pose significant challenges for monetary policy there will be limited policy space for rate cuts in future downturns hence recoveries will be slow and inflation below target also the limitation in the ability of central banks to offset downturns results in an adverse feedback loop that is expectations of low future inflation drag down current inflation and further reduce available policy space separately williams told bloomberg tv that as tariffs get larger assuming that happens the effects will be bigger boosting inflation in the next year and probably having negative effects on growth we could probably get a couple tenths or two tenths on the inflation rate over the next year based on what has already been announced if there is further escalation in terms of tariffs those effects would get even larger he added uk unemployment rate dropped to 44 year low but wage growth slowed uk unemployment rate dropped to 3 8 in march

give rise to the hope that the german economy too has grown more strongly than expected in the first quarter zew president achim wambach said the decline in the zew indicator of economic sentiment

will china use its us 1 2 trillion of us debt as firepower to fight the trade war china s promise to strike back after us president donald trump increased tariffs on us 200 billion worth of chinese goods on friday has heightened uncertainty on how escalating trade tensions between the two countries will unravel and raised fears among investors and analysts of worst case scenarios that will hurt global growth if china is unwilling to play ball on trump s terms beijing analysts said not only could retaliate by imposing countervailing tariffs of its own but also has a range of financial firepower at its disposal to punish the us for starters china could strike back by dumping its vast holdings of us government debt flooding the market with treasuries would push down us bond prices and cause the yields to spike that would make it more costly for us companies and consumers to borrow in turn depressing america s economic growth cliff tan east asian head of global markets research at mufg bank said it was unlikely that china would choose to scale back its holdings in us treasuries sharply as that would hurt its own interests and fuel extreme market volatility dumping treasuries would be an ineffective weapon for china as that would send yields higher and hurt the positions of their own holdings in treasuries said tan if china got out of us dollar assets completely it would be very risky to them because of extreme market volatility the trade war had seemed on the cusp of ending until sunday when trump threatened to raise existing tariffs in a tweet sending chinese stocks and its currency lower this week the benchmark shanghai composite index touched its lowest level in 10 weeks while the yuan is heading for its biggest weekly decline since mid 2018 minutes after the us raised tariffs from 10 per cent to 25 per cent on friday the ministry of commerce reiterated its tough stance in the trade war saying in a statement we ll have no choice but to take the necessary countermeasures nonetheless the statement said beijing remained hopeful to resolve the problem through cooperation and negotiations vice premier liu he had been in washington since thursday for two days of trade talks which ended late friday morning without a resolution up until 2016 the people s bank of china was buying us dollars from exporters while selling yuan to them to prevent the chinese currency s excessive appreciation most of china s us 3 1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves the world s largest is parked with us treasury securities which have a safe haven status china needs the us dollar assets as a safety buffer should it need to bail out the domestic banking system or to support the yuan through foreign exchange intervention although it has cut its holdings in us treasuries in recent years it still takes the top spot among foreign creditors at us 1 123 trillion followed by japan with us 1 042 trillion the amount however is only about 5 per cent of the us total debt of us 22 trillion owed by the federal state and local governments as of february of the total more than us 5 trillion is actually owned by the federal government in trust funds dedicated to social security much of the rest is owned by individual investors corporations and other public entities including the chinese government although us 1 123 trillion is by no means a small amount it accounts for only about 5 per cent of the us national debt and it remains to be seen if china s paring back of its holdings would lead to any effective results dumping treasuries is unlikely to be an effective move for trade war negotiations china is unlikely to find alternative investment options given that it holds so much said betty rui wang senior china economist at anz bank still if china decided to sell us treasuries and bought oil oil producers who receive the us dollars may channel them back into us treasuries which would not increase china s leverage to protect its interests mufg s tan said a better option for china would be to allow the yuan to depreciate against the us dollar to offset the negative impact of the tariffs the us had demanded china to limit the yuan s depreciation and thus the competitive advantage of china s exporters analysts had previously said the condition was seen by beijing as an acceptable term to end the trade war but this week s decline in the yuan s exchange rate dashed hopes that beijing would fulfil us demands to keep its currency stable at all costs if there is no currency stability pact negotiated then this is certainly one way china can prepare for what we think is going to be pretty serious escalation of tariffs tan said the latest round of tariff increase to 25 per cent by the trump administration now matches the rate imposed on a prior us 50 billion category of chinese machinery and technology goods trump has also threatened 25 per cent tariffs on possibly another us 300 billion worth of chinese goods source south china morning post

from brics to wows financial markets finally pulled their heads out of the sand overnight as the us china trade war escalated when china responded by imposing usd60 billion in tariffs of their own on imported us goods a healthy dose of reality bites saw the equity markets and oil crumple us bond yields fall and gold finally rally all of which should have happened at least a week ago the greenback was of course mostly resplendent rising 1 against both the offshore and onshore chinese yuan leaving both around 6 9000 to the dollar and within shouting distance of 7 0000 a level that will almost certainly have president trump s twitter account working overtime a look around asia however revealed several less mainstream currencies have actually surprised with their strength the thai baht vietnamese dong bangladeshi taka indian rupee and yes the japanese yen all either held their own or rallied against the mighty greenback readers will know the brics of course i am calling these countries the wows the workshop of the world substitutes if readers can construct something wittier i would love to hear it if the us china trade war digs in for a very long campaign many of those products we ve never heard of from the workshop of the world will have to come from somewhere and cheaper it s highly unlikely that usd500 billion of widget manufacturing will magically transpose itself to the rust belt of america in an employment nirvana i m afraid perhaps the strength of these lesser traded currencies reflects that theme they re simply best poised to benefit from a shift in trade war production equities wall street had a terrible night with the s p 500 falling 2 40 the nasdaq choking on an apple and falling 3 40 and the dow jones down 2 40 it was really a continuation of the rot that had set in throughout asia and europe earlier in the day but it likely means that regional stock markets will be a sea of red this morning given that equity markets are so far behind the curve in repricing the risk to the new world reality equities could be in for an extended period of pain those with high beta to china such as taiwan hong kong indonesia and australia may find it reaches migraine levels currencies the us dollar remained firm overnight supported by safe haven inflows into the bond market where us yields continued to fall one of the first things my grizzled chief dealer told me 30 years ago as a spotty junior was always to buy dollars in a war he didn t specify what sort of war but the advice remains sound especially so as us interest rates make it an effective high yielder in a zero interest rate world the british pound gbp notably fell through the critical 1 3000 level to 1 2950 as the conservative and labour brexit talks look close to collapse at least uk politics remain consistent regional currencies will remain under pressure to varying degrees today with the australian dollar aud a noted underperformer falling 0 80 to 0 6950 with nab business confidence this morning a federal election on saturday and its role as a china proxy the sharks are well and truly circling the not so lucky country dollar oil that other bastion of irrational exuberance oil finally felt the chill winds of potential trade war fallouts on consumption overnight attacks on two oil tankers in the middle east was not enough to save the black gold as brent crude fell 1 30 to usd70 25 a barrel and wti dropped 1 40 to usd60 90 a barrel iranian tensions and a possible escalation of hostilities in the middle east may slow oil s pullback but trade tensions should mean that oil finds plenty of willing sellers on any intra day rallies in asia gold gold rallied usd14 or 1 1 to recapture the usd1 300 00 an ounce level overnight propelled by belated but heavy safe haven buying the yellow metal enjoyed a sprightly start in asia rising to usd1 302 00 in early trading with usd1 310 00 the next major technical resistance area trade war fallout can finally put a floor under gold for now and it may well continue to make upside progress as investors seek shelter from the storms it s important to realise however that gold s rally is not a gold story but a safe harbour story that is a crucial difference with any sudden breakthroughs in the trade standout possibly seeing investors stampeding for the exit as fast as they arrived
overview president trump s willingness to meet china s xi at the g20 meeting at the end of next month and his feeling that an agreement will still be found seemed sufficient to break the momentum that had swept through the capital market equities in the asia pacific were mostly lower with japanese benchmarks underwater for the seventh consecutive session india and korea bucked the regional trend european bourses are firm led by the communication and materials sectors up around 0 4 in late morning turnover the dow jones stoxx 600 has recouped about a third of yesterday s loss us shares are trading higher and around a quarter of yesterday s 2 4 drop appears to be recovered the dollar is mixed with the recent leaders the yen and swiss franc paring the recent gains while the scandis lead the advancers emerging market currencies are trying to stabilize while gold s three day rally is stalling around 1300 the bitcoin rally is extending its 12th session asia pacific china detailed its tariff response to the us actions and roughly 90 of the imports from the us will have a 25 tariff both china and the us provocative actions left a small room to manoeuver specifically the new us levies do not apply to goods in transit and china s tariff increases will not be implemented until june 1 however no fresh talks have been scheduled the process by which the us will slap a 25 tariff on the remaining chinese goods that have not been covered yet has begun but will likely take several weeks to work through so that when trump meets with xi at the g20 meeting at the next of next month the new tariff gun will be loaded the conventional wisdom is that both sides want a deal of course the economic logic is compelling but it seems naive to think that simply because both sides have an economic interest in avoiding a tit for tat downward spiral in trade it means that a deal must be forthcoming the actions lead us to believe that both sides saw in their interest not to strike a deal now the us claim that china was backtracking is not new it made the same claim in february but talks proceeded what changed the political calculus trump has said he wants a great deal which means we suspect a comprehensive agreement and despite the assurances it was nearly at hand the odds of such a resolution was increasingly unlikely trump apparently judged more could be achieved and by that we mean his domestic agenda as well through escalating the trade spat than by resolving it with other actions intended to curb china such as the weapons sale to taiwan the efforts to block the belt road initiative the campaign against huawei and the blocking of china mobile chl officials in beijing recognize a new form of containment japan s current account stood at jpy2 85 trillion in march with us japanese trade talks underway today s report is a timely reminder of what drives japanese external surplus and it is not trade of that current account surplus only about jpy700 billion less than a quarter can be traced to the trade surplus the c a surplus is driven by investment income which are dividends and coupons of portfolio investment but also profits royalties licensing fees and dividends from direct investment included in the balance of payments data japan reports some of its portfolio purchases two developments stand out first japanese investors bought almost as much french bonds jpy3 18 trillion as they bought in the previous 12 months jpy3 45 trillion japanese investors bought jpy4 26 trillion of us bonds in march nearly buying back three quarters of what it had sold over the past year japan s preference was for us corporate bonds which accounted for almost 90 of its march purchases of us bonds the dollar has been confined to yesterday s ranges jpy119 00 jpy119 85 as the market catches its collective breath the 680 million in a jpy119 strike that expires today looks safe as does the 630 million in a jpy109 40 option that also will be cut today the intraday technicals give a reasonable chance that the 690 million at jpy110 could be in play before the expiration a close above the jpy110 10 area would boost the technical chances that a low is in place the australian dollar is not finding much traction and it remains pinned near yesterday s low 0 6940 it is trading like a proxy for china sentiment but employment data early thursday in sydney may offer a domestic distraction initial resistance is seen near 0 6960 the yuan weakened for the eighth session of the past nine but the fix was in line with market expectations and did not seem to reflect an attempt to drive it lower we expect chinese officials to seek to temper the depreciation as the dollar draws close to cny6 90 as the official tolerance may extend toward cny7 0 europe the uk s cross party talks apparently ended without much progress may holds a cabinet meeting today and will meet with the party s rank and file on thursday the latest polls show that may is leading the party into a third electoral defeat she lost the parliament majority the recent local elections saw a defeat of historic proportions the tories are polling around 10 in the eu parliament elections labour is not doing much better at 16 the new brexit party is drawing a third of the vote separately the uk reported a higher claimant count 24 7k vs a revised 22 6k in march softer pay increases and an unexpected fall in unemployment 3 3 vs 3 4 germany s zew survey was mixed the assessment of the current situation improved to 8 2 from 5 5 which is more than economists anticipated it is the first increase since last september on the other hand the expectations component fell back into negative territory 2 1 where it had been since april 2018 except for last month note that germany reports q1 gdp tomorrow recall that it contracted in q3 18 and was virtually flat in q4 18 it is projected to have grown about 0 4 in q1 19 the euro is trading in the lower half of yesterday s range which was roughly 1 1220 1 1265 there is a 910 million euro at 1 1240 that expires today it looks to be another consolidative session the euro has not traded above the 1 1265 area since april 18 just below 1 2925 sterling made a new low for the month today while it has stabilized in the european morning the 1 2970 is the nearby cap which may prove sufficient to limit gains today separately stronger than expected

import and exports price indices don t move the market in the best of times let alone in the current environment fed presidents george and daly speak today williams spoke in asia the market has turned very aggressive about pricing in fed easing the january fed funds contact implied a 2 24 yield before trump s tweets announcing the end of the tariff truce the yield fell to 2 15 by the end of last week it is currently implying a yield of 2 08 meanwhile the effective average fed funds rate has eased seven basis points to 2 38 since the fed cut the interest on reserves to 2 35 from 2 40 from the current 2 38 the market has nearly 1 5 cuts priced in if we assume that the interest on reserves will be cut a little more than a fed funds target rate reduction the last pullback in the s p 500 was in march the 2810 area which the s p 500 traded through but closed back above is the 61 8 retracement of that rally since march there are two levels to monitor the first is the 2840 area a move above here would begin repairing the technical damage it seems premature to expect this today the second is the 2775 area where the 200 day moving average is found a break of it would likely target those march lows near 2722 the us dollar remains in a cad1 34 cad1 35 range it is difficult to get enthusiastic one way or the other we see a sharp narrowing of the interest rate differential and better than expected data to be a net positive but due to the risk off sentiment and the weakness in oil prices the interest rate consideration has been unable to express itself we expect mexico s high real and nominal interest rates to continue to attract speculative flows the us dollar remains within last friday s range against the peso mxn19 045 mxn19 283 editor s note the summary bullets for this

the contemplation by asian finance leaders to add the chinese and japanese currencies to a regional foreign reserves buffer fund is the latest sign that the trade war is causing countries to slowly move away from dependence on the us dollar their consideration analysts said could be underpinned by expectations of the shift in world consumption patterns and corporate investments away from a globalised trading system and towards a system centred on the three large regions the us the european union and china that operate differently the 10 members of the association of southeast asian nations plus china japan and south korea together known as asean 3 were reported earlier this month to be considering including the yuan and the yen to their chiang mai initiative multilateralisation cmim scheme a framework for multicurrency swap arrangements the us 240 billion cmim scheme was established in response to the 1997 asian financial crisis to serve as a safety net that provides us dollar support to any one of the countries in the event of a liquidity crisis the leaders of asean 3 said with the region facing threats from trade protectionism and reduced external demand concrete measures needed to be taken to improve procedures and institutional arrangements of the finance process to foster regional integration and sustainable development increased mutual agreements on initiatives relating to the promotion of local currency usage and a greater role for local currencies as reserve currency local currency contributions to the cmim may be one enhancement option they said in a joint statement released earlier this month the asean members are brunei cambodia indonesia laos malaysia myanmar the philippines singapore thailand and vietnam the review of the cmim scheme to add additional regional currencies into the fund amid the escalating us china trade war underscores not only growing efforts in asia to bolster intraregional financial linkages but also the regional countries intent to reduce reliance on the us dollar based financial system until now america s global influence had come more from the strength of its financial sector than its military might said mike o sullivan former chief investment officer in the international wealth management division of credit suisse thanks to the ubiquitous use of the dollar the depth of its capital markets and the power of its banks the trade dispute was a marker of china s rise and the belated realisation of america s elite as to how it should curb this o sullivan said china s rise in recent years and its ambition to lead a new economic world order have irked the us which has dictated global trends for decades trade tensions between the world s two biggest economies escalated last july when us president donald trump slapped the first round of tariffs 25 per cent on us 34 billion worth of chinese imports followed by 25 per cent tariffs on an additional us 16 billion in august a further escalation occurred friday when the us raised levies for another us 200 billion of chinese goods from 10 to 25 per cent and started making preparations to impose 25 per cent tariffs on all remaining imports from china worth about us 300 billion as trade talks between the two countries hit an impasse last week the us dollar remains the global reserve currency accounting for 63 per cent of global reserves the euro is in second place at 20 per cent but it has suffered the largest proportional decline over the past 10 years the japanese yen ranks third at 4 9 per cent by comparison the yuan accounts for about 1 9 per cent of global reserves and a 1 2 per cent share for international payments the potential addition of the yuan into the cmim scheme would be another boost to china s relentless push to promote wider use of its currency alongside its global economic rise concerns about the country s financial stability and its relatively closed capital account had limited the usage of the yuan and prevented it from becoming a dominant reserve currency said colin ellis credit strategist at moody s investors service international trade and financial links with china were unlikely to prompt major changes in foreign reserve composition in the near term ellis said but standard chartered s greater china senior economist kelvin lau said the internationalisation of the yuan had continued to gather pace this year despite the trade war foreign investors had raised their holdings of onshore yuan denominated assets with equity investments in particular jumping 46 per cent in the first quarter lau said recent official comments including xi jinping s keynote speech at the belt and road forum show continued commitment to further opening up china s markets encourage fair competition and protect foreign interests he said the belt and road initiative is china s global trade strategy to spur economic activities along the ancient silk road land and sea routes linking asia africa and europe the initiative together with the increase in the opening up of the chinese domestic financial markets had made the internationalisation path of the yuan clearer said betty rui wang anz bank s senior china economist when the global financial system is dictated by us dollars you need other currencies for diversification china aims to open up its capital account and the increased international use of the yuan will help chinese exporters to manage their currency risks wang said source south china morning post
the world is turning into a prepper s dream the trump administration jacked up tariffs last week as everybody knows about by now and another 300b in goods remains on the 25 tariff chopping block any minute china is vowing to retaliate and president trump is threatening them via twitter if they do quoting statistics that are hard to understand only 4 points were paid by the u s 21 points by china bloomberg has already debunked this further may 18th could see more tariffs of 25 tacked on to all car part imports to the us from any country according to george will and to add a layer of rancid frosting on this rank cake being baked as we speak now saudi arabian oil tankers are being attacked in the persian gulf and oil has spiked again as a result rather than engage in stock picking in response to this tsunami of news i m sure there will be many articles on this on seeking alpha this week i d like to analyze all this from a monetary and interest rate perspective as is my wont this is a partial follow up on my previous article on the us money supply and what that means for equities in the months ahead and possibly years ahead if this trade war isn t resolved soon the main point i would like to make is that as bad as tariffs are for the economies and stock markets of both the us and china what matters more is how tariffs affect the current business cycle if at all if this trade war slows down monetary growth in both countries then the current downtrend should continue if it doesn t then a reversal is more likely to higher highs in any case a quick reminder i had said three weeks ago that the next 3 weeks could be decisive in terms of money supply and whether it signals a double top in the broader indexes a best case scenario would see m2 total savings and demand deposits in the us banking system climb for the weeks of april 8th and april 15th and retreat less than 1 2 for april 22nd the good news for the bulls is that this is pretty much what ended up happening m2 went up 0 33 then 0 18 then fell 0 88 during the annual post tax day slide these are very bullish numbers by themselves and could indicate a relatively high m2 growth rate trough of about 2 5 annual by mid to late august however i also said three weeks ago that most likely something in the middle and more indeterminate will happen so while the raw m2 numbers by themselves seem bullish for the broader indexes i am reluctant to pull the trigger on going long the nasdaq qqq or s p 500 spy at this point as of the newest m2 numbers there has been another strong drop from the 22nd to the 29th of another 0 8 that is the biggest drop for this week of the year the federal reserve reports m2 on a 10 day lag since 2014 this in itself is not so alarming since 2014 had a relatively high m2 annual growth rate trough also of 2 5 thanks to strong m2 upticks at the turn of each month up to the trough for real danger we have to get down to 1 5 or 1 which we saw in summer 2015 so still so far so far so good on the m2 front though it s not perfectly bullish and continued monitoring is warranted if there is no strong rebound next week on the turn to may we could be back in trouble again from a monetary standpoint a week to week fall this thursday could be particularly dangerous as the next seasonal turn for strong week to week growth is during the turn from may to june 5 weeks from now until then we are going to be static at best next week s numbers from april to may also typically show growth but not that much historically the tariff hike and worsening trade war could mess with the entire monetary picture fundamentally and change the entire trajectory of the business cycle perhaps in extreme ways depending on how the chinese retaliate and currencies react first we must understand what exactly happens to us dollars in the current trade structure between the us and china this article from investopedia explains it well here s a summary prepare for a bunch of acronyms let s use the examples of joe the american importer and cho the chinese exporter joe makes an order of say 10m for cho s goods in usd cho needs renminbi rmb so he goes to the people s bank of china pboc which buys usd and prints up rmb out of nothing in exchange this is how the pboc peg between usd and rmn functions in a basic sense pboc then takes usd and buys treasuries ust from usa shipping usd right back to usa keeping long term rates low in usa and m2 generally rising what happens now that tariffs are raised joe can afford less goods from cho sends him less usd cho sends less usd to pboc which in turn prints less rmb and buys less ust from usa interest rates rise more than otherwise now one could try to argue that m2 would still rise as before ceteris paribus since usd isn t being exported to china in the same quantities leaving those usd in usa and raising m2 more than otherwise this analysis is incorrect because usd exported to china comes right back to usa anyway when cho sells it to pboc for rmb and pboc buys ust so the situation now is we have the same amount of usd here in the domestic banking system than otherwise just with higher interest rates which on the whole constricts m2 here we re not even talking about active retaliation yet but rather simply natural monetary consequences of less trade between the two countries china will simply have less usd to spend on ust than otherwise simply because american importers will be able to afford less chinese stuff given the tariffs the trade deficit with china and the amount of debt china buys are directly correlated though trump does not seem to understand this with less chinese buying of ust either government spending will have to come down proportionately this absolutely will not happen or other ust investors will have to fill the gap one could argue that the additional revenue from tariffs will offset the lower buying of ust but that s faulty reasoning also the us government will be collecting less in taxes from american importers from china cancelling out the gains in tariff revenues government spending goes up as always and interest rates rise more than otherwise here s where things get really dangerous though if no new demand is found for the ust gap the fed will have to buy the difference to keep interest rates under control aka qe combine that with less imports of goods from china and we have a lower goods supply in the usa and the fed monetizing additional debt not bought by the chinese again not even out of retaliation but simply because they have less dollars to buy ust with active retaliation will make the situation even worse and it s coming the danger is a quick spike in price inflation that could catch the fed by surprise and we could quickly end up in a stagflationary feedback loop whether that happens soon or not will depend on how the chinese choose to respond to trump s latest escalation of the trade war if they decide to sell some of their existing stockpile of over 3 trillion in ust things could go downhill quickly the usd ust and equities could all go down together while real assets appreciate we don t know if this is imminent and everything could be diffused quickly and continue as normal if the two sides decide to ratchet down the trade war congress s recent passage of a pro taiwan resolution 414 0 on may 8th that violates china s one china policy namely that taiwan is part of china certainly isn t helping the trade situation though regardless of what one may think of taiwan s situation politically the crux of it is this monetarily things look bullish right now cross winds from the trade war an entirely political rather than monetary phenomenon are pulling down equities hard if we short the market now we risk getting whipsawed if there is any concrete good news out of talks with china if we go long and there are any developments with iran or saudi arabia regarding oil equities could fall even faster for now the best thing to do is to stay on the sidelines and see how this all plays out this market is about to get very volatile here is a list of resources to watch through the summer while all this goes on in the background china forex reserves these consist of mostly ust support is at 3 trillion if that number gets breached ust may be coming under a selling attack china m2 money supply so far seasonal trends are continuing you can check this by looking at the same period for last year at the link and the year before by tweaking the dates at the chart if there are any anomalies in the months ahead in the down direction it means the chinese are trying to prop up their currency at the expense of the dollar the yuan is already falling so we ll see what the pboc does cpi inflation for june and july could be critical and be the tell if the tariffs affect cpi directly we ll know by then if they do the fed likely won t take immediate action correctly blaming it on the trade war which they have nothing to do with and seeking symmetrical 2 inflation anyway risking a spiral once the inflation genie is out of the bottle it s hard to stop the federal government cannot afford to pay the interest rates required to stop it if it comes out this time m2 money supply this thursday first numbers for may we have never seen a week to week fall on the turn from april to may as far back as records go if we do now then it would indicate that the trade war is affecting loan activity and that would be the time to go short on friday as it would signal something wrong at the business cycle level and not just the external economic layers in short the trump administration is playing with fire from so many directions that traders are about to get seriously seasick if you want to go short wait for the m2 numbers on thursday if they fall from last week despite new data for may then the trade war has probably infected the monetary dimension and i ll go short if the numbers are up as usual i m holding off for another month to see how the june numbers come in if i miss the decline in the meantime so be it
overview president trump s willingness to meet china s xi at the g20 meeting at the end of next month and his feeling that an agreement will still be found seemed sufficient to break the momentum that had swept through the capital market equities in the asia pacific were mostly lower with japanese benchmarks underwater for the seventh consecutive session india and korea bucked the regional trend european bourses are firm led by the communication and materials sectors up around 0 4 in late morning turnover the dow jones stoxx 600 has recouped about a third of yesterday s loss us shares are trading higher and around a quarter of yesterday s 2 4 drop appears to be recovered the dollar is mixed with the recent leaders the yen and swiss franc paring the recent gains while the scandis lead the advancers emerging market currencies are trying to stabilize while gold s three day rally is stalling around 1300 the bitcoin rally is extending its 12th session asia pacific china detailed its tariff response to the us actions and roughly 90 of the imports from the us will have a 25 tariff both china and the us provocative actions left a small room to manoeuver specifically the new us levies do not apply to goods in transit and china s tariff increases will not be implemented until june 1 however no fresh talks have been scheduled the process by which the us will slap a 25 tariff on the remaining chinese goods that have not been covered yet has begun but will likely take several weeks to work through so that when trump meets with xi at the g20 meeting at the next of next month the new tariff gun will be loaded the conventional wisdom both sides want a deal of course the economic logic is compelling but it seems naive to think that simply because both sides have an economic interest in avoiding a tit for tat downward spiral in trade means that a deal must be forthcoming the actions lead us to believe that both sides saw in their interest not to strike a deal now the us claim that china was backtracking is not new it made the same claim in february but talks proceeded what changed the political calculus trump has said he wants a great deal which means we suspect a comprehensive agreement and despite the assurances it was nearly at hand the odds of such a resolution was increasingly unlikely trump apparently judged more could be achieved and by that we mean his domestic agenda as well through escalating the trade spat than by resolving it with other actions intended to curb china as the weapons sale to taiwan the efforts to block the belt road initiative the campaign against huawei the blocking of china mobile officials in beijing recognize a new form of containment japan s current account stood at jpy2 85 trillion in march with us japanese trade talks underway today s report is a timely reminder of what drives japanese external surplus and it is not trade of that current account surplus only about jpy700 bln less than a quarter can be traced to the trade surplus the c a surplus is driven by investment income which are dividends and coupons of portfolio investment but also profits royalties licensing fees and dividends from direct investment included in the balance of payments data japan reports some of its portfolio purchases two developments stand out first japanese investors bought almost as much french bonds jpy3 18 trillion as they bought in the previous 12 months jpy3 45 trillion japanese investors bought jpy4 26 trillion of us bonds in march nearly buying back three quarters of what it had sold over the past year japan s preference was for us corporate bonds which accounted for almost 90 of its march purchases of us bonds the dollar has been confined to yesterday s ranges jpy119 00 to jpy119 85 as the market catches its collective breath the 680 mln in a jpy119 strike that expires today looks safe as does the 630 mln in a jpy109 40 option that also will be cut today the intraday technicals give a reasonable chance that the 690 mln at jpy110 could be in play before the expiration a close above the jpy110 10 area would boost the technical chances that a low is in place the australian dollar is not finding much traction and it remains pinned near yesterday s low 0 6940 it is trading like a proxy for china sentiment but employment data early thursday in sydney may offer a domestic distraction initial resistance is seen near 0 6960 the yuan weakened for the eighth session of the past nine but the fix was in line with market expectations and did not seem to reflect an attempt to drive it lower we expect chinese officials to seek to temper the depreciation as the dollar draws close to cny6 90 as the official tolerance may extend toward cny7 0 europe the uk s cross party talks apparently ended without much progress may holds a cabinet meeting today and will meet with the party s rank and file on thursday the latest polls show that may is leading the party into a third electoral defeat she lost the parliament majority the recent local elections saw a defeat of historic proportions the tories are polling around 10 in the eu parliament elections labour is not doing much better at 16 the new brexit party is drawing a third of the vote separately the uk reported a higher claimant count 24 7k vs a revised 22 6k in march softer pay increases and an unexpected fall in unemployment 3 3 vs 3 4 germany s zew survey was mixed the assessment of the current situation improved to 8 2 from 5 5 which is more than economists anticipated it is the first increase since last september on the other hand the expectations component fell back into negative territory 2 1 where it had been since april 2018 except for last month note that germany reports q1 gdp tomorrow recall that it contracted in q3 18 and was virtually flat in q4 18 it is projected to have grown about 0 4 in q1 19 the euro is trading in the lower half of yesterday s range which was roughly 1 1220 1 1265 there is a 910 mln euro at 1 1240 that expires today it looks to be another consolidative session the euro has not traded above the 1 1265 area since april 18 just below 1 2925 sterling made a new low for the month today while it has stabilized in the european morning the 1 2970 is the nearby cap which may prove sufficient to limit gains today separately stronger than expected industrial output figures 2 1 increase in march the third consecutive increase from turkey and the better market mood may be helping the lira stabilize today america the us economic calendar is light import and exports price indices don t move the market in the best of times let alone in the current environment fed presidents george and daly speak today williams spoke in asia the market has turned very aggressive about pricing in fed easing the january fed funds contact implied a 2 24 yield before trump s tweets announcing the end of the tariff truce the yield fell to 2 15 by the end of last week it is currently implying a yield of 2 08 meanwhile the effective average fed funds rate has eased seven basis points to 2 38 since the fed cut the interest on reserves to 2 35 from 2 40 from the current 2 38 the market has nearly 1 5 cuts priced in if we assume that the interest on reserves will be cut a little more than a fed funds target rate reduction the last pullback in the s p 500 was in march the 2810 area which the s p 500 traded through but closed back above is the 61 8 retracement of that rally since march there are two levels to monitor the first is the 2840 area a move above here would begin repairing the technical damage it seems premature to expect this today the second is the 2775 area where the 200 day moving average is found a break of it would likely target those march lows near 2722 the us dollar remains in a cad1 34 cad1 35 range it is difficult to get enthusiastic one way or the other we see a sharp narrowing of the interest rate differential and better than expected data to be a net positive but due to the risk off sentiment and the weakness in oil prices the interest rate consideration has been unable to express itself we expect mexico s high real and nominal interest rates to continue to attract speculative flows the us dollar remains within last friday s range against the peso mxn19 045 mxn19 283 disclaimer
by robert romano on may 10 the south china morning post published a report will china use its us 1 2 trillion of us debt as firepower to fight the trade war speculating that china might have potential leverage against the u s after president donald trump levied 25 percent tariffs on a total of now 250 billion of chinese goods but that s all it is speculation nothing more china is in no danger of dumping its treasuries holdings and even if it were it would gain no trade advantage from doing so why you ask because they re a paper dragon for starters if you look at the 16 2 trillion public treasuries market excluding the 5 8 trillion the u s government holds china has about 1 13 trillion of that or about 7 percent of the total the south china morning post s karen yeung warns china could strike back by dumping its vast holdings of us government debt flooding the market with treasuries would push down u s bond prices and cause the yields to spike that would make it more costly for us companies and consumers to borrow in turn depressing america s economic growth so if beijing were to start dumping treasuries flooding the open market interest rates for the bonds they were dumping might increase but just temporarily because to sell they d have to have willing buyers and right now there are plenty of those in fact fearful of the breakdown of trade talks with the u s by china investors are fleeing equities and buying none other than u s treasuries which is driving down interest rates in addition one must also factor in potential actions by central banks to perhaps purchase any bonds that were being dumped even if treasuries markets could not fully absorb the temporary glut in that context both markets and the federal reserve and allied central banks in the uk japan and elsewhere would likely be able to smooth over any impact of china or anyone else dumping bonds so kind of like daffy duck eating the gunpowder and swallowing the match it s a neat trick but china will only be able to do it once moreover dumping treasuries would actually erase china s ability to use treasuries purchases to manipulate exchange rates the way that works is not by dumping treasuries but buying dollars and dumping their own currency in bulk usually with a horde of foreign exchange reserves and using the dollars to purchase treasuries the manipulating country issue domestic securities or raise interest rates during this process to domestic inflation this makes the country s exports to the u s cheaper and helps boost global market share on our side it acts as a tariff since it increases the price of china s imports when it does this yes big purchases of treasuries do tend to push interest rates for our bonds down and with lower interest rates the dollar tends to be cheaper on a price basis because of the manipulation relative to the yuan it remains more expensive after this process here china has an additional advantage in this regard with its ability to set the fixed exchange rate so when it wants to manipulate it can devalue the yuan buy dollars with it and buy treasuries with those and repeat the cycle it s quite ingenious and is one of the reasons why china and other exporters have such large sums of treasuries to date again it makes its exports to the u s cheaper and just one more non tariff barrier that makes it more difficult for the u s to ship goods there since the process also makes imports more expensive that is why president donald trump should not only tell china to bring it on when it comes to dumping treasuries he might also consider having the u s treasury label china a currency manipulator and bar it from purchasing any more treasuries after all china needs to keep buying treasuries to exert its trade advantage without treasuries to fall back on the yuan could appreciate vis a vis the dollar even with the fixed exchange rate dumping treasuries is often viewed as a potential retaliatory move by china but the only way it might hurt would be if doing so would set off a sovereign debt style crisis with high interest rates and low demand but that is extremely unlikely to occur even if the initial aftermath was painful even without china u s paper is still very much in demand what china would lose in the process would be its manufacturing market share to other countries that could use the new available stockpile of treasuries on the market to devalue their own currencies and compete with china for goods shipments to the u s in other words markets are resilient and should be more than able to offset any interest rate impact on china dumping treasuries and in the meantime beijing would gain no advantage in doing so it s not leverage it s suicide they can stop buying paper or we could block them from buying more paper we don t need china to buy u s debt someone else will it s no skin off our nose robert romano is the vice president of public policy at americans for limited government you can read more of his articles at

the article published in this column on may 7 2019 showed that the whole world is watching the us monetary policy because the us dollar is the widely used global reserve currency the article also highlighted that the model of the monetary policy implemented by the us federal reserve system fed at present is primarily the regulation of the daily liquidity in the banking sector to control financial conditions i e interest rates and credit desirable for the control of inflation symmetrically around 2 present us monetary policy model key monetary policy tools the fed funds rate target and open market operation omo buying and selling of securities by the fed are the major policy tools the omo is the mechanism used to regulate the liquidity or funds in the banking sector in order to control fed funds rates inter bank overnight interest rates within the rate targets therefore the fed attempts to control both the price interest rate and quantity liquidity in the inter bank market inflation control the fed believes that this price quantity control will have corresponding impact across the financial sector which will influence all economic activities the overall economic impact will eventually be the change in commodity prices or inflation over the time i e tight monetary policy to reduce inflation and relaxed monetary policy to raise inflation therefore the fed takes policy decisions to drive annual inflation around a target goal set by the fed in order to preserve the purchasing power of the us dollar as such the fed has both goal independence and tool independence policy cycle the us monetary policy in the recent past is seen in two distinct periods the period of policy relaxation from august 2007 to december 2016 and the period of policy tightening thereafter such policy cycles are generally seen in almost all countries this article covers the us policy tightening period background for tightening ultra relaxed monetary policy the present policy tightening phase commenced to reverse the ultra relaxed policy that was implemented during the period from august 2007 for the recovery from the financial crisis 2007 09 in the us and europe the fed cut fed funds rate target to 0 0 25 by december 2008 from 5 25 in august 2007 to bring down interest rates close to zero so that credit and spending could be raised significantly to stimulate growth and employment to keep interest rates close to zero the fed had to print an excessive amount of money through purchase of securities omo known as quantitative easing as a result the fed balance sheet assets reported a historic increase by four times or us 3 583 bn between 2007 and 2014 i e from us 915 bn in 2007 to us 4 498 bn in 2014 this would have created a phenomenal amount of new liquidity in the world through credit money multiplier around 4 the forward guidance given by the fed for this monetary policy was to raise inflation to 2 from deflation and to reduce unemployment to 6 from 10 policy tightening phase when the economy recovered to strong levels with inflation around 2 unemployment falling below 5 and growth rising to 3 4 the fed started to tighten the monetary policy the idea was to prevent inflation rising above 2 in future due to excessive liquidity prevailing in the economy the fed envisages to pick neutral long term levels of interest rates and unemployment that are expected to keep the economy stable the fed communicated the tightening signal in two stages first it terminated the monthly asset purchase programme qe in october 2014 however all maturity proceeds of assets held by the fed under qe were reinvested to prevent a drastic reduction in market liquidity second the fed raised fed funds rate target to 0 25 0 50 in december 2015 after maintaining it at 0 0 25 for 7 years thereafter the fed started faster tightening since december 2016 raising fed funds rate target the fed raised the fed funds rate target eight times by 0 25 each during the period from december 2016 to december 2018 the total increase is 2 from 0 25 0 50 to 2 25 2 50 see chart 1 in december 2018 the fed speculated another three interest rate hikes by 0 75 in 2019 the fed chairman jeromy powell made a comment at a forum on october 2 2018 that interest rates are still accommodative we are gradually moving to a place where they are neutral but not that we are restraining the economy we may go pass the neutral but we are a long away from the neutral at this point probably at this time fed funds rate target was 2 00 2 25 the fed did not provide any forecast for neutral interest rates but clarified neutral interest rates as interest rates that neither restrain nor overheat the economy based on interest rate forecasts of the fed markets speculated neutral interest rates fed funds rates to be around 3 0 to 3 5 reducing money printing while undertaking the omo at reducing phase to control fed funds rates at higher targets the fed reduced its balance sheet by about us 523 bn from december 2014 to march 2019 by absorbing money permanently from the economy the reduction from december 2017 to march 2019 alone was us 475 bn see chart 2 reinvestments of maturity proceeds of fed s assets also were gradually reduced i e from all monthly maturity proceeds and interest in the month of october 2014 to maturity proceeds in excess of us 30 bn in respect of treasury securities and us 20 bn in private securities in the month of march 2019 policy spillovers the us monetary policy decisions immediately cause considerable spillovers across financial conditions in both the us and the rest of the world they affect real economic activities i e resource mobilization production employment wages spending and prices inflation over a period of time the monetary tightening is expected to tighten financial conditions and slowdown inflation spillovers in the us economy accordingly the faster tightening led to raise interest rates and decelerate liquidity and credit flows as compared to interest rates around zero kept for about 7 years the increase in interest rates by 2 in just two years 2017 2018 was considerable for the us as a result short term interest rates and yield rates in all us financial markets rose sharply while securities prices declined the us yield curve became flattening as short term yields rose faster than long term yields where the yield for 10 years fell 6 basis points below 3 months yield first time since 2007 in march 2019 in addition financial markets underwent considerable volatilities and sell offs from time to time however the us economy showed mixed results unemployment steadily declined from 4 7 in january 2017 to 49 year low 3 6 in april 2019 while new employment rose on records the gdp growth slowed down from 4 2 in second quarter 2018 to 3 2 in first quarter 2019 annual inflation which reached 2 target in 2016 18 started falling away below 2 i e 1 5 in march 2019 therefore analysts including the president donald trump and his economic team started heavily criticizing the fed s policy tightening when both inflation and unemployment were falling and that the fed s economic models were outdated to track the real economy global spillovers emerging market economies started feeling the pinch by way of capital outflows in early 2018 although those central banks did not act timely high interest rates along with us protectionist economic policies caused capital flows to the us resulting appreciation of the us dollar and excessive depreciation of emerging market currencies in fact emerging world experienced currency turmoil since july 2018 as a result many economies confronted considerable crunches of foreign reserves liquidity and credit which caused adverse effects on the growth currency depreciation led pressures on inflation in countries that widely depended on imports as an immediate reaction many central banks raised policy interest rates in the range of 0 5 to 10 to fight capital outflows and injected fresh liquidity by printing money to keep financing the economy some central banks even tightened controls of import credit and foreign exchange the global growth also started showing signals of slowdown since fourth quarter 2018 due to trade tensions between the us and china and frequent volatilities of financial markets and capital outflows fed s response to adverse spillovers in this background the fed on march 20 2019 decided to pause interest rate hike and to provide some accommodative measures decisions to slow down the reduction tapering of fed balance sheet and to pause the tapering since september 2019 are to ease the financial conditions the fed also changed its policy goal as to sustain economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the american people as against earlier communication of maximum employment and stable prices inflation target of 2 therefore the fed now seems to prioritize the growth the new policy stance has brought some stability to both the us economy and emerging market economies therefore in last two weeks central banks who do not have major concerns over foreign reserve levels decided to cut policy interest rates meantime the second round of us tariffs hike from 10 to 25 announced last friday on imports worth us 200 bn from china and plan for tariffs on additional us 300 bn of imports are likely to call for accommodative monetary policies in both the us and china to address possible adverse effects on growth in retaliation china also raised tariffs on u 60 bn worth imports mainly agricultural products from the us the us proposed us 15 trillion of subsidy plan to support agriculture the us stocks fell on monday and wiped out nearly us 600 bn of value in this background some analysts predict even a rate cut by the fed in the second half of 2019 and another three cuts later the president trump commented that the us economy would go up like a rocket if the fed cuts interest rates by like 1 and resumes asset purchases quantitative easing chinese central bank also will relax monetary policy and raise new funding at low cost to identified sectors of the economy to negate the price impact of new tariffs central banks in advanced market economies also will keep current relaxed policy stance given the slowdown in global growth and further recovery needed in this background it may not be unreasonable to predict a new phase of monetary accommodation in the us and the world this would be a relief to emerging market economies however monetary policies are highly uncertain in present market based models despite policy forecasting models as policy decisions are driven by theoretical thoughts rather than credit delivery across economic sectors the next article will cover the us monetary policy relaxation since 2007 the writer is a former deputy governor of the central bank and chairman and member of 6 public boards with nearly 35 years of public service he authored 6 economics and financial banking books and more than 60 published articles his latest book innovating central banks covers a detailed part on the monetary policy
the canadian dollar rose slightly by 0 06 percent as trade concerns eased but not enough to change the narrative the us is still on the offensive with a new round of tariffs in effect and working on a list of 300 billion in chinese imports subject to tariffs without walking back those comments the trump administration showed willingness to sit down and negotiate as even if they claim they would win a trade war they would prefer a good deal with china stocks rebounded after the less combative statements and risk appetite for equities was higher in the currency world the us dollar gained ground against safe havens like the japanese yen and the swiss franc the british pound continues to lack traction awaiting any progress on brexit proposals the eur depreciated after a disappointing german zew report that turned negative as investor sentiment are pessimistic on the economy in the next six months german gdp data tomorrow could further validate the outlook if it comes under the 0 4 percent forecast canadian inflation will be the highlight of wednesday s economic calendar for cad traders a massive job gain in april could find it hard to translate into higher wages so inflation is expected to remain stable if the us decides to engage in a trade war with china two scenarios become clear a north american block strengthening the usmca to better integrate the economies of the us mexico and canada in order to avoid inflationary pressures due to higher imports and a growth slowdown the opposite scenarios would be to open up more trade war fronts and not ratify the usmca taking the same combative stance against canada which could put the loonie under pressure as the economy depends on trade with the us oil oil higher after drone attacks reduce saudi arabia s output oil prices rose after saudi arabia reported a drone attack on one of its pipelines on tuesday supply disruptions have kept crude higher even as the us has ramped up production the opec agreement to limit output is the biggest factor but geopolitical disruptions like the us sanctions against iran and venezuela and the armed conflict in libya are added to the situation in saudi arabia saudi arabia is seen as the main producer that could cover the gap in supply left by iranian crude us president donald trump has tweeted about the opec s role in keeping prices lower if they increase their output the deal between opec and other major producers will reach its end in june but it could be extended if participants deem the market has not reach price stability which was their main goal russia remains a big question mark as it has sacrificed its revenue to be part of the deal and could be ready to take advantage of higher prices ahead of even higher levels of us production causing another drop us production has increased dramatically to the point that the one time net importer is now an exporter of energy products shale technology has tipped the scales of global production and threatens to reduce the influence that the opec has on the market the decision from opec members to fight fire with fire and flood the market to drive shale operations into bankruptcy backfired and forced the group to reach out to non opec members in order to have a significant impact on the market by collectively reducing their output gold gold loses safe haven appeal as trade concerns ease gold lost 0 31 percent on tuesday after china and the us both issued less aggressive comments hinting at a new round of talks trade war concerns eased and with them the support for the yellow metal as a safe haven gold will remain in the conversation as geopolitical risks remain with the ongoing trade negotiations as well as brexit and the upcoming australian elections a trade deal with china was thought to be in the final stages but last week the us suddenly announced china had backtracked on previous commitments and set a friday deadline for tariffs to rise to 25 percent and a new proposal on 300 billion of chinese imports content is for general information purposes only it is not investment advice or a solution to buy or sell securities opinions are the authors not necessarily that of oanda business information services inc or any of its affiliates subsidiaries officers or directors if you would like to reproduce or redistribute any of the content found on marketpulse an award winning forex commodities and global indices analysis and news site service produced by oanda business information services inc please access the rss feed or contact us at info marketpulse com visit to find out more about the beat of the global markets 2023 oanda business information services inc
latin america used to be the worldâ s most prosperous emerging region but it is on the verge of being overtaken by other regions that were long considerably poorer it has lost ground since the 1980s despite reform initiatives because of sluggish growth and the unequal distribution of the gains of that growth latin americaâ s missing middle rebooting inclusive growth pdfâ 2mb focuses mainly on brazil colombia and mexico and examines two â missing middlesâ holding the region back a robust cohort of midsize companies and a solid middle class with growing spending power the two are connected expanding the pool of modern competitive firms can create better paying jobs and lift middle class demand needed for new investment the disruption presented by adoption of digital technologies provides an opportunity to reignite this virtuous cycle of growthâ but it will require reforms to help companies compete and workers prepare section 1 latin america faces a dual challenge of slow gdp growth and unequal distribution of the gains of that growth growth in latin america has been slower and more volatile than in other emerging economies and the unequally distributed gains from that growth have failed to ignite the domestic economy and sustain growth gdp growth in the region averaged 2 8 percent annually between 2000 and 2016 far lower than the 4 8 percent rate in 56 other emerging economies in the same period not including china which grew at twice that pace among latin american economies peru grew most strongly averaging 5 2 percent per year of the three countries that are the focus of this report colombia performed best with average growth of 4 2 percent brazilâ s growth rate at 2 4 percent was closer to the regional average while mexicoâ s was weaker at 2 1 percent in addition to being weak regional growth has been volatile buoyed by the commodity boom which saw prices for resources such as oil mineral and some agricultural products surge only to fall back sharply the largest driver of gdp growth in latin america has been expansion of the labor force the result of a demographic boom and increased participation of women the workforce grew by 66 million workers between 2000 and 2016 and this expansion accounted for 72 percent of the regionâ s overall gdp growth the demographics are now changing fertility rates in latin america declined from 4 2 in 1980 to replacement rate in 2015 this means the region will need to count on productivity growth rather than labor expansion as the main driver of gdp growth this would bring latin america into line with other emerging economies where labor expansion has been a much smaller factor in driving gdp growthâ 37 percent on average in 56 countries excluding chinaâ and considerably less important than productivity growth the largest driver of gdp growth in latin america has been expansion of the labor force the result of a demographic boom and increased participation of women a sharp reduction in poverty is a notable success but more than 150 million people in latin america remain vulnerable since 2000 56 million peopleâ or more than 40 percent of latin americaâ s poor in 2000â have crossed the 5 per day absolute poverty threshold reducing the overall proportion of people in poverty to 13 percent of the total from 27 percent both the income boom from rising commodity prices and governmentsâ pro poor policies propelled this movement these include conditional cash transfer programs in mexico and brazil which tie transfers to keeping children in school or making preventive healthcare visits bolsa famã lia the brazilian program launched in 2003 now reaches 14 million households about one quarter of the population and helped bring down the proportion of those living in extreme poverty from 10 percent to 4 3 percent over a decade the poverty reduction momentum has slowed in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis and the end of the commodity boom however by 2018 poverty and extreme poverty rates had risen above the levels of a decade earlier while poverty has been reduced since 2000 the slow expansion of higher productivity and higher wage jobs has left many vulnerable no longer officially poor they have not yet reached comfortable middle class spending patternsâ meaning they are still unable to afford goods and services that go beyond basic needs and may not have access to creditâ and remain at high risk of falling back into poverty during a recession or in the event of a health or employment crisis more than one third of the regionâ s population lives on less than 11 per day based on purchasing power parity including 152 million people in the â vulnerableâ category of 5 to 11 per day over 60 percent from brazil colombia and mexico more than 60 percent of the population lives on less than 20 per day exhibit 1 1 the bottom 90 percent in latin american households consumes just 64 percent of the total the lowest share in the world consumers crossing over to the middle class have more money and more access to credit to spend beyond basic necessities and they tend to spend a higher share of their income than more affluent people however social inequality marks consumption patterns in latin america the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution in latin americaâ the regionâ s poor and vulnerable and most of the middle classâ accounts for just 64 percent of domestic consumption this is the lowest share in the world akin to that in sub saharan africa but substantially lagging behind other regions where the bottom 90 percent consumes about 70 percent or more of the total exhibit 2 2 section 2 a missing middle of dynamic midsize companies reduces competition and innovation the business landscape in latin america is polarized the region has some powerful companies including some with very high productivity that have successfully expanded from their strong local base to become global companies or â multilatinasâ â regional powerhouses operating across latin america they include ab inbev america movil arcor bimbo cemex embraer femsa techint group among others by comparison with large firms in other regions such companies are fewer in number and less diversified beyond energy materials and utilities at the same time latin america has a long tail of small often informal companies that collectively provide large scale employment but whose low productivity and stagnant growth hold back the economy missing is a cohort of vibrant midsize companies that could bring dynamism and competitive pressure to expand the number of productive and well paying jobs in latin america much as these firms do in many high performing emerging regions exhibit 3 shows how much less prevalent large and midsize companies over 50 million in revenue are for the size of the latin american economy compared with peers elsewhere argentina brazil chile and mexico have only about half as many of these large firms relative to gdp as a range of ten emerging economies we use as benchmarks 3 latin americaâ s large companies can face less dynamic domestic competition than peers in other regions the missing middle of companies reduces competitive pressure on large incumbents in comparing latin american companies with large firms in a benchmark set of ten countriesâ china india indonesia malaysia philippines poland russia south africa thailand and turkeyâ we find several indications that the competitive dynamics are less powerful but with important variation across countries we chose these benchmarks based on geographic variation and similar levels of development but we do not claim they are globally representative the missing middle of companies reduces competitive pressure on large incumbents first the number of public companies with revenue rising above 100 million since 2000 is smaller proportionately in latin america than in high performing asian countries whereas 87 percent of publicly listed companies of this size in our benchmark countries have crossed the 100 million threshold since 2000 the proportion is less than 60 percent in brazil and mexico colombiaâ s much smaller corporate sector has been more vibrant with 81 percent of firms crossing that threshold since 2000 second is the degree of turnover at the top of the rankings top quintile of companies with more than 500 million in revenue in the best performing emerging economies have a hard time getting to the top and staying there less than half of top ranked firms in economic profitâ that is returns above the cost of capitalâ in one cycle were still at the top in the next cycle in latin america we see a distinction between mexico where two thirds of the top quintile firms in terms of economic profit remained in place over the past 15 years whereas in brazil only one third did indicating a more vibrant market other economies in the region tend toward the average of our benchmarks third these dynamics have correlated with concentrated gains in some cases some recent research shows that latin american firms have been able to command larger and more stable markups on their products dating to the 1980s that was even before the rise of the â superstarâ phenomenon among large global firms that are capturing an ever larger share of profits and pulling away from their peers we also find that midsize and large firmsâ profit margins in our three countries are higher across most sectors since 2000 than in our benchmarks the variation in economic profit is also higher the top quintile economic profit is higher and the lowest quintile economic profit is lower more negative than in the benchmark economies trade protection a legacy of earlier import substitution policies also continues to contribute to high consumer prices in a number of industries the causes of this firm distribution and dynamics are rooted in common legacies of import substitution that favored a few private licenses or large state run firms in many sectors other reasons are differing ways in which state companies were privatized and especially in brazilâ s case tax and compliance heavy regulation that favors either large scale or informality unequal access to finance weak infrastructure and high input costs also squeeze the middle the result is a weak level of innovation and specialization needed for future growth brazil colombia and mexico rank below their development level on innovation indices they have one quarter to one third of the digital diffusion of the united states for example research and development investment in the region is relatively low at just 0 3 percent and 0 5 percent of gdp for colombia and mexico respectively although it reaches 1 2 percent for brazil this compares with about 1 percent for benchmarks much of latin americaâ s labor force is trapped in a long tail of small unproductive and often informal firms the other side of this dual economy is a multitude of small companies many of which operate outside the formal economy as do some midsize and even large firms these small companies tend to have low productivity and absorb a significant proportion of low skill workers they are most concentrated in sectors like retail construction and agriculture brazil has had the most success in reducing the level of informality in the overall labor force the rate fell below 50 percent in 2015â 16 mexico and colombia have much higher rates of 57 percent and 62 percent respectively according to household surveys in each country in mexico for example small retailers employ two thirds of the sectorâ s workforce or 6 6 million workers but value added per worker is only about one seventh that of large and more efficient retailers retail highlights how the long tail of small companies drags down overall productivity in mexico for example small retailers employ two thirds of the sectorâ s workforce or 6 6 million workers but value added per worker is only about one seventh that of large and more efficient retailers to increase our understanding of the long tail of small businesses and its resistance to change we conducted a survey of 3 000 workersâ informal formal and self employedâ in brazil colombia and mexico it suggests that a majority of workers see self employment as the main fallback option when wage employment is not available 70 percent of respondents said temporary or informal self employment was a viable option in a time of financial uncertainty such uncertainty is high with 28 percent of all workers saying they expected to leave their job in the next 12 months the survey also highlights the constraints of small business some 28 percent of the sample were self employed of which about half were formal businesses only one in four of respondents indicated that they had access to the credit needed to expand their businessesâ but two in three said they would like to expand if they could section 3 a missing middle of consumer holds back domestic demand and incentives for investment the other missing middle is a cohort of upwardly mobile consumers whose rising disposable income helps drive economic demand and investment on a sustainable basis as noted many of those lifted out of poverty remain vulnerable and have not reached a comfortable middle class existence for this cohort the main path to sustained and rising prosperity comes from access to productive well paid jobsâ which have been too scarce to meet the needs of the rapidly expanding labor force in the region as the supply side challenge of a missing middle of companies has constrained the expansion of attractive jobs with higher wages and opportunities to build skills it has contributed to the demand side challenge of a missing cohort of middle class consumers with sufficient income to sustain robust domestic demand the sluggish demand acts as a serious drag on the economy it limits the growth of markets for domestic businesses that constitute the majority of jobs in a modern economy it also holds back the development and provision of more complex goods and services which in turn could strengthen the economy by encouraging investment the growth patterns providing the context for this missing middle differ among our focus countries in brazil the commodity boom led to rising wages and helped draw workers from small scale agriculture to low skill jobs in small establishments with below average productivity in mexico by contrast wage growth has been strikingly weak and at times negative even in expanding high productivity sectors such as automotive consumption has grown with expanding population exports are not filling the demand gap and both investment and savings are relatively low household consumption represents the biggest share of gdp expenditure in any economy and 64 percent in latin america yet it has expanded only slowly contributing 1 9 percent to gdp growth compared to 2 7 percent in our emerging market benchmarks furthermore compared to benchmarks a higher proportion of the consumption growth that has occurred in latin america has come from expanding population rather than rising per capita consumption since the turn of the millennium per capita consumption growth in latin america has been just 1 8 percent less than half the 4 3 percent in benchmark countries colombia is high for the region with per capita consumption growth since 2000 of 2 8 percent while chile and peru are outliers at 3 7 and 4 2 percent respectively in mexico the reverse is true per capita consumption growth accounted for less than the population growthâ s contribution consistent with low wage growth this matters because consumption patterns change as incomes rise with markets for more complex goods and services growing to provide new growth opportunities for business a higher proportion of the consumption growth that has occurred in latin america has come from expanding population rather than rising per capita consumption the purchasing power of latin american consumers is further taxed by the high cost of many consumer goods trade barriers continue to raise local prices above global ones including for basic goods such as food similarly taxes can limit the purchasing power of those most ready to spend in brazil value added tax represents 40 percent of the total tax burden compared with 32 percent of the tax burden in organisation for economic co operation and development oecd countries on average taxes on cars approach 50 percent of the cost to consumers counting all taxes the lowest decile ends up paying 32 percent of income in taxes compared with 23 percent for the middle decile and 21 percent for the top decile the difficulty in obtaining consumer credit and underdeveloped digital services in finance and retail compound the plight of the vulnerable financial inclusion is limited with less than 50 percent of people in mexico and colombia having access to bank accounts this restricts the ability of households to make the most of their incomes by borrowing and saving only 6 percent of sales in brazil in 2017 took place online for example about the same proportion as in india and indonesia but substantially lower than in china 16 percent and south korea 13 percent however digital disruption is starting to appear in colombia notably a startup called rappi is providing on demand delivery of items such as groceries and medication and has become one of latin americaâ s first â unicornsâ â a startup with a valuation of at least 1 billion the argentine digital marketplace mercadolibre is also gaining ground and spreading across the region exports could help fill this demand gap providing the incentives and markets that companies in latin america need to invest and broaden their production however with the notable exception of mexico exports play a smaller role than in the other emerging economies we use as benchmarks exports in the region account for just 22 percent of gdp compared with 36 percent in the benchmark countries mexico has achieved a much stronger export performance since the establishment of nafta its exports of goods and services rose from 25 percent of gdp in 2000 to 38 percent in 2017 however the benefits of its export growth have not spilled over into the domestic economy more broadly expectations of future demand are a main reason for companies to invest in larger and better production capabilities with limited access to export markets and slowly growing domestic demand latin american economies have maintained rates of investment below those of their peer economies latin american and caribbean investment in 2016 amounted to 19 percent of gdp below the global average of 24 percent and the investment rate among east asian emerging countries of 41 percent of our three focus countries only colombia reached the global average recording a rapid rise from 13 to 24 percent between 1999 and 2015 before dipping in the mexican auto sector labor income gains have come from added workers at a wage level that is 1 6 times the national average yet the average wage of mexican autoworkers declined in the same period income is not flowing through to expanded domestic consumption for different reasons a comparison of brazil and mexico the flow of income to expanding domestic consumption can slow for different reasons brazil and mexico provide two examples in brazil social policies minimum wage increases and a credit expansion during the commodity cycle upswing all gave a boost to the domestic marketâ but it was not sustained employed labor income accounted for 57 percent of gross income growth due mostly to expansion of low skill retail and other services the demand boom was not matched by supply side reforms to raise productivity however moreover high consumer prices and expensive credit continued to tax the purchasing power even of those with rising incomes the benefits faded away through inflation and macroeconomic instability once the commodity boom ended the demand boom was thus unsustainable because it was not supported by supply side initiatives or a macro environment conducive to private investment mexico by contrast focused on supply reforms and access to external markets boosting productivity among the large modern segments of many industries by as much as 5 6 percent in the 2000s mexico by contrast focused on supply reforms and access to external markets boosting productivity among the large modern segments of many industries by as much as 5 6 percent in the 2000s yet domestic demand has lagged productivity in the long tail of small industries did not improve and unlike in brazil the gains did not feed through into broad based wage growth rather they accrued mainly to the profit share of income for example while manufacturing productivity increased by an average of 1 7 percent annually between 2005 and 2015 average wages were stagnant given that a higher share of wage income is spent rather than saved this limited the multiplier potential of the productivity gains to translate into a more sustained source of domestic demand expansion domestic market growth was thus limited crimping incentives for investment the middle lost out amid these changes the mexican auto sector provides one striking example of the divergence between productivity growth and wages production has grown at an annual average rate of 7 percent since 2006 and after doubling in a decade labor productivity now ranks with that of the top producers in the world labor income gains have come from added workers at a wage level that is 1 6 times the national average yet the average wage of mexican autoworkers declined in the same period by comparison south korea at the same point in its auto industry development saw a 58 percent increase in sector wages over the corresponding ten years of productivity growth in colombia the patterns of growth since the turn of the century have been more inclusive wage growth averaged more than 2 percent annually exceeding productivity growth and reflecting productivity gains across sectors some six million workers joined the workforce between 2000 and 2015 with disproportionate gains for women however this rapid expansion slowed wage growth compared with some peers for example thailand grew at about the same rate during this period but nonetheless achieved wage growth of 3 7 percent almost double that of colombia thanks to substantial productivity gains section 4 filling in the missing middles and capturing the next wave of growth if latin american economies were able to fill in and strengthen the missing middles thereby establishing a virtuous cycle of inclusive growth the potential reward would be substantial using a macroeconomic simulation that assumes conservative growth in productivity is matched by increased labor shares and consumption in line with more inclusive countries we find that achieving such a growth cycle could lift gdp in the region in 2030 by 50 percent above a baseline scenario that factors in current trends including reduced labor force expansion that would amount to an increase per person of more than 1 000 per year or a 1 trillion incremental boost to gdp in 2030 obtaining that prize will be challenging governments and business leaders will need to embrace a growth focused policy agenda that addresses the missing links of past reforms even in a time of social and political tensions latin america has a new opportunity to revitalize inclusive growthâ and new tools to achieve it digital technologies that can raise productivity growth and develop the missing middles if embraced and adopted at scale digital entrepreneurship is already on the rise with new platforms and applications from e commerce to digital finance springing up across the region several digital startups have achieved valuations of 1 billion valuation or more digital technologies can help directly address some of latin americaâ s challenges around the missing middles while not a â silver bulletâ or cure all the technologies can make it easier for companies to open businesses register property and file taxes over the internet reducing the cost of red tape digital can facilitate more efficient markets from land and jobs to local services digital platforms make it possible for small and mid size companies to become â micromultinationalsâ able to compete with much larger competitors by offering their goods and services through online marketplaces regionally or globally critically digital can and is already creating new more productive jobs in latin americaâ and the potential productivity boost it could give to the regionâ s economies as a whole could offset the drag from its changing demographics at the same time these technologies present potential risks for inclusive growth in terms of job displacement and further concentration of profits three priorities will be needed to lay the foundations for a pro growth inclusive agenda for the region and make it better able to embrace digital disruption first is the need to create a competitive business environment in which digital can thrive innovation is rewarded and opportunities are created for all especially squeezed firms in the middle that will mean using digital tools where available to cut red tape improve access to finance and reduce barriers to entry and growth that reduce dynamism and performance pressure second regulation will need to be redesigned to create labor and consumer markets that spread productivity gains to the vulnerable and middle classes if latin america is to boost prosperity for all productivity gains must flow to rising incomes for workers as they increase in skill level and to firms well placed to reinvest in their people technology and communities third government itself can leverage digital platforms to raise public sector efficiency and improve the delivery and cost of public services institutions will need to adapt and shift focus from protecting and regulating the status quo to encouraging new investment and experimenting with new delivery solutions institutions will need to adapt and shift focus from protecting and regulating the status quo to encouraging new investment and experimenting with new delivery solutions such changes will make latin america better able to harness digital technologies which could serve as a powerful source of productivity and growth many countries in latin america have already started on this path if that energy can be maintained and built out the region may be ripe for a digital spring while the changes may be led by digital companies and technologies they will extend to non digital parts of the economy too disruption from digital and in the broader economy offers an opportunity for a new model of inclusive growth in which governments facilitate new sources of productivity for firms and workers and design policies to share benefits with all citizens
getty the economy follows an inexorable pattern of peaks and troughs and the transitions between those points expansions and contractions our current condition puts us in one of the longest expansions in us history the us economy began its expansion in june of 2009 and will mark its ten year anniversary at the end of june 2019 at that point it will be the longest expansion in us history the average post wwii expansion has been about 58 4 months this expansion however long it lasts will likely be at least twice as long there are clear commonalities among the 11 prior post wwii recessions all 11 had fed funds rate increases prior to recession each instance saw a drop in the unemployment level prior to recession five recent recessions had a spike in oil prices 1973 1980 1990 2000 and 2008 let s look at some prospective differences the fed has two wrenches in the past the fed s chief tool of monetary policy has been the federal funds rate the fed remains vigilant watching inflationary trends and raises the fed funds rate to slow the economy and hopefully forestall inflation short term rates drive the direction of lending rates so this tool works albeit with a noticeable lag the lag tends to cause the fed to overshoot the rate increase historically fed rate increases have preceded recessions the fed has stopped short term rate increases and engineered a soft landing about three times in its history the fed now has a new tool in its toolbox thanks to the bond buying program of quantitative easing as of may 1 2019 the fed had total assets of 3 9 trillion compared to 800 billion at the start of the last recession the fed currently holds about 1 575 trillion in mortgage backed securities and about 2 1 trillion in treasury securities the fed s position with those securities was to roll off those securities at a rate of about 50 billion a month this means the fed would simply allow the securities to expire theoretically and only in theory because this has never happened before the roll off would raise longer term rates the fed must choose a course of action in terms of its balance sheet it can increase its securities holdings stimulate or do nothing neutral the fed has announced that it will cease balance sheet normalization in september 2019 what will the outcome of this decision be and how will it affect the economy we don t know yet we export oil now we didn t then in five out of the six most recent recessions oil prices rose either prior to or commensurate with the recession in december of 1973 oil prices doubled in a month thanks to an opec oil embargo from march of 1979 to march of 1980 oil wti rose from 15 85 a barrel to 38 the same scenario arose in 1990 when wti went from 16 87 in june to 35 92 in october oil tripled before the 2000 recession and similarly moved from 54 57 in january of 2007 to 133 93 in june of 2008 us oil imports peaked in 2008 in august of 2008 us oil imports for the month were about 320 million barrels compared to 186 million barrels in february of 2019 simply put in the past oil price spikes hurt the us economy more than they do now if oil prices rise now us producers see higher returns and money flows in not out we re bloated with debt we are awash in debt more so than in all other post wwii recessions gross public debt is nearly 105 of gdp in contrast with about 68 of gdp at the start of the 2008 recession add to that an 800 billion dollar budget deficit and we have a debt tsunami typically debt increases in a recession as the government tries to stimulate the economy with spending is the answer to just keep borrowing china in all post wwii recessions the us has clearly been the dominant economic superpower today china s gdp as measured in purchasing power parity ppp is over 27 trillion versus just over 21 trillion for the us china s trade with the us in 2018 was 737 billion china gdp in 2009 was around 5 trillion it is now estimated at 14 trillion by contrast the us gdp in 2009 was 14 4 trillion with a 2019 estimate of 21 trillion china was unaffected by the 2008 09 slowdown how will the interface of the two economies play out what does a protracted trade war do to the relationship the new unknown the tax cuts aren t built for downturns the tax cuts and jobs act tcja the massive fiscal stimulus from 2017 initiated major changes in tax planning for businesses and individuals the aftershocks continue to be felt by tax professionals and their clients the tcja brought sweeping changes in corporate and individual income taxes tcja cut the corporate tax rate to 21 and cut most of the brackets for individuals it also provided a significant cut for small business owners of pass through entities however there are some significant changes that will be of importance in a downturn net operating losses nols under prior law if a business had a net operating loss they could carry back the loss two years and carry forward the loss up to 20 years this allowed a smoothing of losses and provided some stimulus in a down year where the prior returns could be amended and a refund applied nols were formerly 100 applied against taxable income as an example amazon amzn currently has about 627 million of nol carry forwards under tcja nols may not be carried back but can be carried forward indefinitely however an nol now only offsets up to 80 of taxable income if xyz company generates a 100 million loss in the past they could carry the loss back and offset it against 100 of the prior two years taxable income and carry any remainder forward 20 years under the new law xyz gets no current benefit for the nol and can only offset it in the future and only then at 80 of future taxable income by the joint committee on taxation s jcx 67 17 estimates this is a tax increase of about 200 billion for corporations the tcja basically establishes a minimum tax on income in post nol years of 4 2 compound this with full expensing rules tcja allows bonus depreciation of up to 100 of the cost of an item however if purchasing a piece of equipment runs our company into an nol we end up deferring the tax benefit of the purchase this may thwart some purchases if a business perceives a downturn excess loss limitation a second aspect of tcja that will have a significant effect in a downturn is the excess loss limitation provision for noncorporate owners of pass through entities under the prior law business losses from a non passive business were deductible against other income from any source under tcja the excess business losses are limited to 510 thousand for a married couple filing jointly and 255 thousand for all other taxpayers any excess losses are carried forward and treated as an nol suppose cindy is single and has a start up software business with 510 thousand in losses she also has 250 thousand in other income note there are some questions on what constitutes other income 20 thousand in dividends and 150 thousand in capital gains under the previous rules cindy would have income of 90 thousand which she could carry back against the previous two years income under the current rules cindy would have income of 165 thousand 250 20 150 255 the remaining losses would be carried forward and then offset against 80 of future income professor steven dilley ph d cpa jd of michigan state university thinks the ell rules have a wide reach a considerable number of cpas will be seeing these rules impact their clients because many start up businesses are pass through entities and have initial year losses said dilley this will be of greater consequence if we have an economic slowdown the last compounding factor is the complex networking of new tax provisions the new pass through rules interface with the nol and ell provisions and those interface with the full expensing provisions j michael kolk cpa tax partner at cohen company in akron ohio foresees a considerable expansion of new tax planning the average business owner will now have several new tax considerations in planning a change in economic circumstances to a business loss can have some big implications bottom line we will sooner or later see an economic slowdown in each of the last eleven recessions we heard this time it will be different we shall hear that prediction again and it will likely be correct

growth engine for boeing apple nike and other american brands china is expected to keep growing in importance as a buyer and america s insatiable appetite for cheap goods has created a chinese factory juggernaut that employs millions of workers the world s two largest economies are each other s biggest trading partners nearly 700 billion in goods were sent between china and the united states in 2018 alone and with 1 1 trillion of treasuries china is america s largest foreign creditor the united states has legitimate complaints about china s trading practices and persuading china to open its market to american sellers is an important goal now and for the future but china and america need one another the tit for tat tariff battle is threatening one of the world s vital economic relationships and because of their size the global economy at a time when the two nations should be forging rules for the next 20 years they are pointing a gun at one another we have to learn how to live with each other said keith lerner chief market strategist at suntrust for good reason the breakdown of the us china relationship is spooking investors and economists alike the dow plunged 617

both sides attempt to improve their negotiating leverage consumers and businesses find themselves caught in the crossfire the levies will increase costs muddle supply chains and drive up debilitating uncertainty ubs cut its 2019 gdp growth forecast for china from 6 4 to 6 2 while beijing will try to soften the blow with stimulus ubs said growth could slip below 6 in 2019 and 2020 if the trade war deepens the risk is monstrous it s very troubling said david kotok chairman and chief investment officer at cumberland advisors the interconnectedness of china and the united states has been driven in

beijing on monday raised tariffs on lng from 10 to 25 china s transition to a consumer led economy creates massive opportunities for foreign companies especially us ones by 2027 rapid income growth will lift about 180 million low and lower middle income households to a higher income bracket according to a study by bain co much of the focus during the trade war has been about the goods exchanged between both nations but american businesses are already cashing in by providing services to china s masses and they re eager to sell even more as china matures while the united states has long had a goods deficit with china it ran a services surplus of 40 5 billion in 2018 leading services exports to china include travel computer software and trademarks according to the office of the us trade representative china has long been a tantalizing place for american banks and investment firms financial services companies hungry to lend to businesses and provide investment banking expertise are

yardeni president of yardeni research wrote in a note dumping treasuries could backfire china also plays a critical role in financing america s staggering debt with 1 1 trillion of treasuries china is the leading foreign creditor that s just ahead of japan and roughly equal to the combined treasury holdings of brazil the united kingdom ireland and switzerland washington uses that debt to fund everything from tax cuts to fighter jets a leader in china s state run media suggested on monday that beijing may try to use treasuries as a weapon in the trade war an alarming idea that could rattle global financial markets many chinese scholars are discussing the possibility of dumping us treasuries and how to do it specifically tweeted hu xijin the editor in chief of china s global times such a move however could backfire on china by hurting the value of its own holdings and limiting its access to us dollars the world s reserve currency they would be shooting themselves said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group boockvar said it s more likely that china will continue to allow existing treasuries to mature without reinvesting them last week s 10 year treasury auction had the weakest demand since 2009 according to boockvar repairing the relationship won t be easy despite concerns over the deepening trade war many investors at the salt conference in las vegas last week applauded president donald trump for confronting china on its unfair trade practices china got used to having this advantage michael novogratz founder and ceo of crypto merchant bank galaxy digital told cnn business you needed to take the punch bowl away optimists hope that the pain from the trade war for both sides will limit its duration many economists expect washington and beijing will eventually come to their senses and reach a trade agreement trade wars are simply bad economics david kelly chief global strategist at jpmorgan funds wrote in a report to clients on monday the silver lining is that they are so clearly detrimental to the american economy and american business that despite current concerns they are unlikely to be a long term feature of our financial landscape but some worry the damage to the us china relationship may be hard to undo even if the whole thing settled today by miracle there would be no trust for a generation said kotok
in the eyes of the times the minimum wage has taken a 30 year journey from zero to hero there is no ill it seems that a higher minimum wage cannot alleviate if not outright cure following decades of moderate minimum wage changes select cities and states have recently passed substantial increases in seattle san francisco and new york city the minimum wage has already reached the milestone of 15 recent laws passed by california illinois maryland massachusetts new jersey and new york call for statewide increases to 15 in the coming years early in february of 2019 the u s house committee on education and labor held a hearing to advance the agenda to take a 15 wage floor nationwide 4 an erosion of the consensus among academic economists predates this lurch in public policy cracks in this consensus emerged in earnest when david card and alan krueger wrote their book myth and measurement the new economics of the minimum wage in the 1990s 5 even so a 2005 survey found that only 17 percent of economists favored increasing the federal minimum wage from the then floor of 5 15 per hour to 6 15 6 a more recent wave of research has coincided with a broader shift among academic economists in 2013 nearly half the respondents to a survey by the university of chicago agreed that a 9 federal minimum wage would be desirable policy 7 in 2015 only 26 percent of economists in a subsequent university of chicago survey worried that a 15 minimum wage would significantly reduce employment for low wage workers 8 proponents of high minimum wages argue that their position is supported by the best evidence giving them the scientific high ground but does the research really justify this confidence and the accompanying shift in the conventional wisdom though proponents of a higher wage can cite many papers to support their view their reading of recent research is incomplete the research these proponents ignore has many strengths including trans parent research methods analyses of high quality data and a truly randomized experiment in contrast to the research emphasized by advocates the broader body of work regularly finds that increases in minimum wages cause job losses for individuals with low skill levels another problem with advocates calls for a much higher minimum wage is that the theoretical basis for their claims is far more limited than they seem to realize advocates offer rationales for why wage rates might be suppressed relative to competitive market values these arguments are reasonable to a point but they are a weak basis for making claims about the effects of large minimum wage increases third economists empirical methods have blind spots notably firms responses to minimum wage changes can occur with nuanced dynamics i discuss why economists methods will predictably fail to capture such dynamics in their totality finally the details of employees schedules perks fringe benefits and the organization of the workplace are central to firms management of both their costs and productivity yet data on many dimensions of workers relationships with their employers are incomplete if not entirely lacking consequently empirical evidence tends to understate the minimum wage s negative effects and overstate its benefits what can we conclude from recent research media coverage of minimum wage changes provides a window into the minimum wage research landscape changes in states minimum wage rates bring news stories on the wage gains workers will receive and the number of workers who are ostensibly poised to receive them as reported on december 27 2018 in a headline from usa today from california to new york states are raising minimum wages in 2019 for 17 million workers 9 the article does not consider that some of those workers may lose employment under the higher wage it does not mention how employers might offset the minimum wage s effects on their costs or how such changes might affect workers lives where do the authors of such articles turn for their facts the usa today article draws on calculations by the national employment law project nelp similar articles from cbs npr and other news outlets draw on calculations from the economic policy institute epi 10 in turn these organizations cite academic research to support their views minimum wage analyses from nelp and epi draw on research papers that have challenged the traditional view that minimum wage increases reduce employment key research in this vein includes a 2010 paper by arindrajit dube t william lester and michael reich 11 a 2011 paper by sylvia allegretto dube and reich 12 a 2017 paper by allegretto dube reich and ben zipperer 13 and a 2019 paper by doruk cengiz dube attila lindner and zipperer 14 each of those papers analyzes a large set of minimum wage changes enacted by u s states or the federal government that spans several decades in every case the authors conclude that there is no evidence to support the view that minimum wage increases cause job losses in a recent piece of congressional testimony reich used this research to argue that minimum wage increases up to 15 have no negative employment effects 15 in addition to influencing policy discussions the papers previously referenced have been influential within the professional research community importantly these studies are not extreme outliers a 2016 analysis by paul wolfson and dale belman found that the estimated effects of minimum wage increases on employment have been on average quite small in recent studies 16 at the same time a great deal of recent research finds that minimum wage increases cause job losses among low skilled population groups in the remainder of this section i discuss four strands of research that fit this description in the first a number of papers use the same data to study the same minimum wage changes as the papers referenced previously but arrive at different conclusions the second strand of research analyzes more compactly defined episodes of minimum wage increases within the recent experience of u s cities and states a third strand analyzes minimum wage changes using high quality administrative data from europe finally i discuss a paper that analyzes a truly randomized experiment involving the imposition of minimum wages in an online labor market research on the long history of u s minimum wage changes the research most often discussed by u s media analyzes over three decades of u s state and federal minimum wage changes in what follows i focus on the substantive issues at stake in the debate within this strand of research readers interested in references to key entries in this debate can find a roadmap in the endnotes 17 researchers estimate the effects of minimum wage changes by making comparisons between states that increased their minimum wages and states that did not the goal is to infer whether an increase in minimum wages led to the number of jobs changing differently than it otherwise would have the key question for evaluating the quality of these analyses is whether the states being compared are good counterfactuals that is do the states being compared reliably allow us to infer how employment would have changed if states had not increased their minimum wages debates between researchers are in large part debates over which approaches to selecting comparisons generate good counterfactuals and hence unbiased estimates in their 2008 book minimum wages david neumark and william wascher summarized existing research as being broadly supportive of the view that minimum wages adversely affect low skilled workers 18 card and krueger s work notwithstanding neumark and wascher argued that the weight of the evidence implied that minimum wage increases reduce employment in their own empirical research neumark and wascher have relied on the broadest possible set of comparisons between states that increased minimum wages and states that did not in contrast papers finding that minimum wage changes have no effect on employment typically rely on subsets of the available comparisons because their comparisons are less selected neumark and wascher s analyses are less prone to charges of data mining this makes their approach the natural default unless there is a compelling case that their method would result in systematically biased estimates critics of their research argue that such biases do exist and are so severe that neumark and wascher s estimates are not credible the claim that a scholarly work lacks credibility is a strong one but does the strength of the evidence match the strength of the claim the answer is no because there is remarkably little fire behind the smoke to date direct evidence for the strengths and weaknesses of alternative research methods is in surprisingly short supply in their own terminology the biases alleged by dube lester and reich are unobserved that is their argument is not built on evidence of specific economic forces that in their telling give rise to systematic biases if anything states appear to enact minimum wage increases when their labor markets are expanding more rapidly than the labor markets in other states this will tend to bias analyses toward finding that minimum wage increases have a positive effect on employment which is the opposite of what neumark and wascher s critics allege as neumark observes in a 2018 review of recent research papers using a variety of best practice methodologies have concluded that minimum wage increases reduce employment 19 indeed several recent papers use methods that are designed to account for precisely the kind of unobserved forces that dube lester and reich claim bias traditional minimum wage research two examples that analyze roughly the same history of u s minimum wage changes include a 2017 paper by david powell and a 2012 paper by yusuf baskaya and yona rubinstein 20 both papers estimate substantial negative effects of minimum wage increases on teen employment echoing the traditional research finding in summary the segment of the minimum wage literature that simultaneously analyzes three decades of minimum wage changes remains contentious relative to neumark and wascher s early estimation frameworks some methodologies for accounting for nuanced biases yield smaller estimates while others yield larger estimates because direct evidence in favor of one approach and against others is in short supply strong conclusions based on this strand of research alone are unwarranted research on recent u s minimum wage changes the debate described above is difficult to evaluate because key differences between competing studies are opaque the studies in question attempt to analyze hundreds of distinct events simultaneously an advantage of this approach is that it may provide evidence for the average effect of minimum wage increases across a broad range of settings but when estimates are in dispute a drawback of such an analysis is that it becomes difficult to determine why competing studies of the same events arrive at different conclusions a number of recent studies take an alternative approach they analyze compact historical episodes in isolation the key benefit of this approach is that differences between studies can be transparently debated with reference to the events surrounding a single historical episode transparency of this sort is crucial for evaluating competing studies for this reason the approach of focusing on compact historical episodes is standard practice in other areas of economic research including analyses of major health and tax policy reforms my own work on the minimum wage has separately considered two distinct historical episodes in a recently published work michael wither and i estimate the effects of the federal minimum wage changes enacted during the great recession 21 the 2007 2009 federal increases had greater effects in some states than others depending on the initial level of a state s minimum wage we use data that follow individuals over time which allows us to separate minimum wage workers from workers with moderately higher skills we find that employment among minimum wage workers declined far more in states that were fully bound by the federal minimum wage changes than in states that were not notably employment among moderately higher skilled individuals does not exhibit this pattern changes in the employment of these workers were comparable between the two groups of states this bolsters the case that our analysis is not biased by differences in the severity of states underlying recessions indeed housing market indicators reveal that our estimates are more likely to be biased toward finding positive effects of minimum wage increases than negative effects we estimate that the federal minimum wage increases enacted during the great recession reduced employment among low skilled individuals by hundreds of thousands of jobs like other minimum wage research that has drawn public attention our work has its detractors zipperer replicated the findings wither and i reported in an earlier version of our paper but he contested our interpretation and conclusions 22 wither and i responded to zipperer s critiques with a series of additional analyses 23 we leave interested readers to digest the details of this debate by reading the studies themselves a number of papers have analyzed state and local minimum wage changes enacted in recent years in a widely discussed study by researchers at the university of washington administrative records from washington state s unemployment insurance system were used to analyze the effects of a recent series of increases in seattle s minimum wage 24 the research team found evidence that hours worked by low wage employees declined substantially in the wake of the series of increases indeed the decrease for all these workers together was so large that their overall earnings declined slightly subsequent work by the seattle team found evidence that employment fell only a little if at all for workers with prior experience in low wage jobs 25 this suggests that employment declined primarily because of reductions in hiring rather than increases in firing at this point readers may be unsurprised to learn that the conclusions of the seattle minimum wage study are in dispute most notably the study s initial findings were contested in a memo from reich to the office of seattle mayor ed murray 26 this memo was complemented by critical analyses by zipperer and john schmitt which were disseminated through the epi 27 in revisions to their analyses the seattle team has responded to several of the initial criticisms leveled against their work although they have only modestly revised their original conclusions it is unclear what economists final verdict on this episode will be many u s states have enacted substantial minimum wage changes in recent years the early phases of these changes have been analyzed in a 2017 paper by radha gopalan barton hamilton ankit kalda and david sovich 28 these authors analyze administrative employment records from equifax which allow them to track roughly one million hourly wage workers using data from 2011 through 2015 they find that establishments that employ low wage workers reduced employment following minimum wage increases this occurred through reductions in hiring rather than layoffs of existing low wage workers which is consistent with the findings of the seattle minimum wage study in additional research michael strain and i are analyzing recent minimum wage changes using precommitted research designs 29 that is to avoid the pitfalls of data mining we are reporting the results of analyses to which we committed after analyzing data that extended through 2015 thus far our estimates suggest that the effects of recent minimum wage changes have been highly varied the largest of states minimum wage increases are negatively associated with employment among those in low skilled groups further the employment declines associated with large minimum wage changes have grown in magnitude as we have incorporated data from 2016 2017 and 2018 into our analyses in contrast small changes have had modest and possibly positive relationships with employment recent evidence points to important roles for subtle yet conventional labor market forces that is the evidence suggests that the dynamics of labor demand are crucial for understanding the minimum wage s effects during the great recession for example a combination of low demand and substantial churn may have set the stage for the relatively sharp effects of the 2007 2009 federal minimum wage increases on employment in contrast it may be the case that only large minimum wage changes have large enough effects on firms costs to alter their hiring during an economic expansion when labor markets are tight firms may effectively ignore small minimum wage increases enabling such increases to have their intended effects on wages research from european contexts a number of recent papers have analyzed minimum wage changes using high quality administrative data from european countries recent country specific analyses examine denmark greece hungary the netherlands sweden and germany while estimates vary substantially among these analyses each case provides evidence that firms respond in traditional ways to increases in labor costs claus kreiner daniel reck and peer skov use danish administrative data from 2012 to 2015 to analyze the employment effects of an age specific increase in the minimum wage 30 they find that the higher wage floor applicable to 18 year olds substantially reduces their employment compared to 17 year olds for whom the wage floor is much lower the employment drop is large enough to ensure that the total earnings of 18 year olds are no greater than the total earnings of 17 year olds despite their higher wage floor constantine yannelis uses administrative employment records to analyze reductions in greece s minimum wage rates 31 the minimum wage changes he analyzes were implemented in 2012 in accordance with international monetary fund bailout terms these wage reductions were disproportionately large for young workers relative to older workers yannelis finds that these changes led firms to significantly increase their employment of young workers relative to older workers peter harasztosi and attila lindner analyze a large national minimum wage increase enacted by hungary 32 they use firms administrative tax filings to classify the extent to which each firm was affected and to track changes in firms employment over time harasztosi and lindner conclude that roughly 1 in 10 workers affected by hungary s dramatic minimum wage increase lost employment because the wage increase was quite large the wage bills of strongly affected firms increased substantially in this setting the authors find that the bulk of the minimum wage increase s costs were borne by consumers through increases in prices jan kabatek looks at the netherlands 33 like denmark this is a case of minimum wage rates that rise significantly with age using data that track individuals over time kabatek concludes that workers become substantially more likely to lose their jobs in the two months prior to birthdays on which their minimum wage rises he finds that these individuals gradually return to employment over subsequent months emmanuel saez benjamin schoefer and david seim analyze swedish payroll tax reductions implemented between 2007 and 2009 34 these tax changes were meant to reduce the cost of young workers to firms from the perspective of firms the tax changes were economically similar to a reduction in negotiated wage rates using swedish administrative records which are renowned for their high quality the authors found that these tax changes led to substantial increases in the employment of younger workers relative to older workers finally marco caliendo carsten schröder and linda wittbrodt summarize research including their own work with alexandra fedorets and malte preuss on the 2015 introduction of germany s statutory minimum wage 35 the german experience was novel because it involved a shift from collectively bargained wages to a statutory minimum wage floor as opposed to an increase in an existing minimum wage these authors conclude that the introduction of the minimum wage caused a small reduction in the number of low wage jobs consistent with work on recent u s minimum wage changes employment declines have come primarily through reductions in hiring rather than increases in firing among those individuals with jobs reductions in hours were large enough to ensure that the monthly incomes of low wage workers changed little an actual experiment a final piece of research that deserves emphasis is a 2018 paper by john horton 36 he analyzes an online labor market in which firms contract with workers for tasks including programming data entry and graphic design in contrast with the papers discussed thus far horton identified an opportunity to deploy a randomized controlled trial to study the effects of minimum wage increases as the designer of the study he could impose differences in firms minimum wage requirements through random assignment he finds that firms make significant shifts in the workers they employ when they are required to pay higher wages in other words they shift away from workers who are the least skilled and toward workers who demonstrate higher productivity on past jobs high minimum wage rates thus reduce the employment opportunities of workers who are less productive does the evidence justify the shift in the traditional consensus why has the consensus on minimum wages shifted this is a difficult question and any answer is necessarily speculative in this section i discuss several issues that arguably are underappreciated by the new conventional wisdom mistake 1 an incomplete reading of the recent research the new conventional wisdom has to an unwarranted degree focused on the debate over the long history of minimum wage changes in the united states that is it has focused on the research discussed at the beginning of the previous section of this paper it has focused less on other lines of research in particular it has focused less on recent research from european contexts including denmark germany greece hungary the netherlands and sweden as well as on research that transparently analyzes compact historical episodes in the u s experience the emphasis of the new conventional wisdom is unfortunate because other lines of research have desirable features in research on the effects of taxes unemployment benefits and other public policy initiatives three attributes of studies have with good reason emerged as attributes toward which researchers strive the first is a preference for data from individual level administrative records over both aggregate data and survey data the second is a preference for running experiments whenever possible the third is an emphasis on implementing transparent research methods the research that forms the basis of the new conventional wisdom tends to lack all three of these attributes even when these studies methods appear transparent and intuitive opaque choices tend to determine both the sets of events that are studied and the comparisons underlying the estimates in contrast the research with which many audiences are less familiar includes truly randomized experiments and makes regular use of transparent methods and individual level administrative records mistake 2 shortcomings in the application of economic thinking in addition to taking a narrow view of the recent literature the shifting consensus on the minimum wage has roots in several short comings in the application of basic economic ideas to real world markets the first involves discussions of labor market imperfections the second involves the fact that there is more to a job than its wage the third involves the time horizons over which firms can respond to changes in policy conceptions of perfect competition vs imperfect competition in economic theory the minimum wage s effects depend on how wages are set within labor markets if a market is perfectly competitive then pay aligns perfectly with a worker s productivity under perfect competition a binding minimum wage is by definition a wage that exceeds some workers productivity in this framework a binding minimum wage will inevitably cause some workers to be laid off by firms contrast that with models of markets with imperfect competition the key feature of these models is that market wages are suppressed relative to their perfectly competitive levels that is workers are paid less than the value of what they produce consequently in these models it is possible for a minimum wage increase to improve workers earnings without excluding them from employment firms are willing to pay a minimum wage that exceeds what they would otherwise have paid as long as that wage does not exceed a given worker s productivity in discussions of such models monopsony and frictions are the jargon with which readers may be increasingly familiar the first chapter of alan manning s influential 2003 book monopsony in motion begins with the following thought experiment what happens if an employer cuts the wage they pay their workers by one cent 37 because a penny is very small the answer to this question is nothing from this thought experiment manning concludes that it is monopsony not perfect competition that is the best simple model to describe the decision problem facing an individual employer 38 this shift in framing is of great consequence the textbook mono psony model is one in which a modest minimum wage can actually increase employment among low skilled workers it is a model in which the minimum wage can be used to combat inefficiencies linked to employer market power but the transition from the one penny thought experiment to a monopsony centric view of the labor market merits scrutiny a model s importance stems from the power of its broad predictive and explanatory content not from an illusory to the penny precision whether a competitive or monopsony centric model is more useful depends on key details of both the labor market and the policy changes one is attempting to understand the practical implications of manning s thought experiment hinge on the size of the frictions that give firms market power workers do not leave their employers over pennies it costs more than pennies to find a new job it is the cost of finding a new job that determines the power held by a worker s employer to set wages both data and intuition suggest that employers wield only modest market power over low skilled workers one need only enter a mall with its food court and retail outlets to appreciate the large number of employers to which most low wage workers can potentially apply real world data concur the value of the time it would take most minimum wage workers to find a competitive job offer is unlikely to exceed 1 000 2 000 39 for full time workers these amounts are equivalent to 0 50 1 00 in hourly pay a wage differential of 1 is thus far more likely to lead workers to seek new jobs than the penny from manning s thought experiment real world search costs appear to have quite modest implications for the market power employers can exert over workers in low wage industries such as food service and retail sales the facts suggest that the monopsony framework may be useful for analyzing modest minimum wage increases from modest initial levels but for large minimum wage changes a model approaching the benchmark of perfect competition should be the more reliable guide fringe benefits and other attributes of jobs many analyses of the minimum wage adopt a narrow view of relationships between workers and employers specifically they simplify the relationship to two factors wages and employment in analyses of this sort the minimum wage s effect on a worker s well being is deceptively simple if the wage rises and the worker remains employed naïve models imply that the worker is necessarily better off but in practice when we negotiate with our employers we appreciate that jobs have many subtle but important characteristics work hours can be at the convenience of the worker or at the convenience of the firm the pace of work can be fast or slow safer or riskier and can require more or less mental energy compensation can either include or exclude health insurance retirement contributions and other benefits a job s location can be more or less preferable and opportunities for advancement within or outside the firm can be more or less ample all these factors affect both workers well being and firms bottom lines most minimum wage commentary sweeps these factors under the rug but nuanced models recognize that they are central for understanding the minimum wage s effects adjustments to nonwage factors are among the most obvious and inexpensive adjustments a firm can make reducing noncash compensation and requiring increases in a worker s effort are straight forward ways for employers to align costs and revenues following minimum wage increases crucially actions along these margins will tend to offset any wage increase s effects on a worker s well being because these factors are often unmeasured our awareness of their importance makes it appropriate to embrace humility regarding the strength of the conclusions we can draw from available data economists have long been aware that a job s nonwage characteristics can be central to its value to workers in a 1986 chapter from the handbook of labor economics sherwin rosen observes that the framework of compensating wage differentials has been with the economics profession since adam smith s the wealth of nations 40 there has recently been a wave of high quality research on this theme several recent papers highlight the value of worker driven schedules 41 one paper by nicole maestas kathleen mullen david powell and others finds that workers are willing to pay substantially for improvements in workplace conditions 42 complementary research by isaac sorkin finds that nonwage aspects of jobs account for a large fraction of total variation in workers valuations of jobs among different firms 43 despite the obvious importance of nonwage factors research on the extent to which these factors are affected by minimum wage increases is quite limited because of data limitations the primary nonwage factor that can be incorporated into minimum wage studies is whether workers have employer provided health insurance ephi analyses of historical minimum wage changes tend to find weak evidence of a relationship between minimum wage increases and ephi in contrast analyses of more recent minimum wage changes tend to find negative effects 44 on a qualitatively different but important margin papers by hyejin ku and by decio coviello erika deserranno and nicola persico find that low productivity workers increase their work effort in the wake of minimum wage increases 45 but little if any evidence exists on a rich set of potentially important margins including the flexibility of work schedules dynamics when estimating the effects of minimum wage increases economists struggle to capture subtleties in the timing with which firms might respond an example involving the payment processing technologies in which fast food chains can invest illustrates several points fast food chains can choose either employee operated cash registers or auto mated kiosks an important aspect of this choice is that it involves upfront investments in equipment that may depreciate gradually over many years for new firms high minimum wages may tip the cost calculation in favor of automated kiosks new entrants to the fast food market may thus adopt less labor intensive business models soon after high minimum wages go into effect but for continuing firms the calculation may be quite different this will be particularly true for those that made investments in standard cash registers prior to a minimum wage increase s passage if the minimum wage rises modestly such firms may continue operating with cash registers until their equipment requires replacement consequently their response to a minimum wage increase might not occur until years after the change has gone into effect this difference between new entrants and continuing firms highlights that a minimum wage change s overall effects may unfold gradually economists have little evidence on how firms adjust their capital investments in response to changes in minimum wages efforts to study firms production technologies have to date been indirect for example recent studies by dan aaronson and brian phelan and by grace lordon and david neumark find that minimum wage increases predict declines in employment among workers in occupations whose tasks are readily replaced with technology 46 related analyses emphasize the productivity of the workers within each occupation in his randomized experiment in an online labor market john horton finds evidence that firms shift from lower productivity workers toward higher productivity workers lisa kahn jonathan meer and i similarly find that recent increases in states minimum wages predict increases in the average age and education of workers in low wage occupations 47 minimum wage changes often come with long lags between the dates when they are legislated and the dates when they are implemented in an analysis of recent legislative histories duncan hobbs michael strain and i find that recent state initiated minimum wage increases had lags averaging six months between the date of their passage and the date a first increase was implemented 48 lags between the date of legislation and the final date of multistep increases are much longer empirical methods in the minimum wage literature account poorly for lags between legislative activity and implementation when an increase is signed into law forward thinking firms know to take cost implications into account some firms may thus change their technologies before a minimum wage increase goes into effect firms forward looking responses undermine the ways many economists deploy statistical tests to estimate a minimum wage change s effects when estimating those effects economists worry that their estimates will be biased if the labor markets in states that enact minimum wage increases were trending differently than the labor markets in other states unfortunately these differential trends cannot easily be distinguished from forward looking responses of firms the standard practice in recent research has been to lump these phenomena together that is forward looking responses have been conflated with divergent pre existing trends in turn they are assumed to be evidence that estimates are likely to be biased standard practice thus biases researchers against detecting negative effects of minimum wage increases on employment although this bias remains pervasive in recent minimum wage research its relevance has been recognized for quite some time the implications of investments by forward looking firms were developed in papers by sorkin and by aaronson eric french sorkin and ted to 49 a key empirical aspect of these insights was highlighted in work by jonathan meer and jeremy west 50 who show that common techniques for accounting for divergent trends may in fact bias analyses toward incorrectly concluding that minimum wages have no effect on employment these authors show that in some cases this bias can be resolved by analyzing employment growth rather than employment levels although cengiz dube lindner and zipperer have recently criticized the empirical analysis of meer and west the theoretical thread connecting the analyses of meer and west to those of aaronson french sorkin and to is unchallenged the key conceptual point is strongly intuitive and appears to be well founded conclusion where do we go from here the fight for 15 has shifted from the advocacy fringes to the political mainstream news media increasingly report that a 15 federal minimum wage would benefit low skilled workers at little cost this essay pushes against that shift on several grounds the new conventional wisdom s reading of recent evidence is incomplete its grounding in theory is far more limited than its supporters let on and it ignores significant blind spots in economists empirical methods because 15 wage floors have been narrowly and only recently applied there is no evidence to support the sweeping claim that a 15 federal minimum wage would benefit disadvantaged households at little cost this is particularly true when we consider regions where low housing and labor costs support the social and labor market integration of both immigrants and low skilled native born workers more than doubling the minimum wage from 7 25 to 15 00 risks radically altering the entry level opportunities on which these individuals rely recent minimum wage changes have been substantial with scheduled increases approaching 70 percent of the initial minimum wage in several states large differences in states minimum wage policies have now been sustained for several years recent experience may thus provide the best opportunity in decades to learn about the medium run effects of substantial minimum wage changes as data on recent labor market

speech new zealand government thank you to the wellington chamber for hosting and thanks to all of you for making the time to be here hon grant robertson minister of finance speech 14 may 2019 pre budget speech to the wellington chamber of commerce thank you to the wellington chamber for hosting and thanks to all of you for making the time to be here i am delighted to be here to talk about the up coming budget and to tell you a little about what will be different and indeed what will be the same there has been a fair amount of attention in the media here and internationally on this year s budget our country s first wellbeing budget enough for me to be invited to the recent spring meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund to talk about our approach our ideas are interesting to many countries as they seek ways of building truly sustainable economies that deliver prosperity and fairness and that build trust at those same meetings global economic forecasts were further downgraded for 2019 after having been downgraded only six months earlier global growth is now expected to be 3 3 for the year as the imf head christine lagarde said the global economy is still growing but it is growing more slowly the imf projections for new zealand are that we will grow at around 2 5 in 2019 and 2 9 in 2020 the average growth for advanced economies in the same period is projected to be 1 8 and 1 7 respectively we are projected to grow faster than the us the uk japan canada the eurozone and australia indeed just last week the reserve bank of australia further lowered its 2019 growth forecast for the australian economy from 2 5 to 1 75 there are certainly significant challenges in the global economy and new zealand is not immune to them the tariff war between the us and china has burst back into life and was a major factor weighing on the minds of those i met with in washington so too the uncertainty created by brexit and its impact across europe all of this adds up to a global environment in which new zealand exporters operate that is both unstable and uncertain here at home we know that the fundamentals of our economy are strong we continue to have historically low unemployment and stable low inflation this is supported by budget surpluses and low public debt due to our government s responsible fiscal management there has been a slowing of growth from the heights of recent years as the international situation impacts on new zealand and as both immigration and the housing market slow to more normal levels but we are well positioned to deal with this slowdown and we are holding up well exports and commodity prices are up as are building consents and consumer confidence there are challenges to lift business investment but the base is there to see new zealand through this challenging period recently i even heard someone utter the rockstar word again in respect of our economy actually it was the same person who said it the first time while it is very flattering and the new zealand economy is strong and we are doing better than many of our peers i think it is a term best avoided for many new zealanders the use of this phrase was jarring when they heard it several years ago sure we had and have gdp growth rates that many other countries around the world envied but for many new zealanders this gdp growth had not translated into higher living standards or better opportunities how could we be a rockstar they asked with homelessness child poverty and inequality on the rise this gap between rhetoric and reality was in many senses the defining issue of the 2017 election and what led to the formation of the coalition government this gap between rhetoric and reality between haves and have nots between the elites and the people has been exploited by populists around the globe it is a long term view of mine and the parties that make up this government that we need to close this gap in an inclusive not exclusive way because it is the right thing to do and because we need to do so to ensure the public keep faith and trust in government to do this we need a different view of what constitutes success gdp remains an important measure of activity in an economy but it doesn t tell us about the quality of that activity we still have thousands of young people not in employment education or training the home ownership rate has fallen to its lowest rate in over 60 years we have one of the highest youth suicide rates in the oecd hundreds of thousands of children are growing up in poverty and māori and pasifika continue to experience poor outcomes for me a simple growth rate is just not sufficient to tell us what success looks like our government will measure its success by how well we improve the living standards and wellbeing of all new zealanders yes we need prosperity but we also need to care about how we sustain and maintain that and who gets to share in it in order to succeed in this we need all the tools available to the government to consider wider wellbeing outcomes to ensure that everything the government does is done explicitly to improve the lives of new zealanders the government does not dictate a person s wellbeing but if we make improving wellbeing our purpose then we have a decent shot at helping improve the lives of all our people obviously one of the most powerful tools available to the government is the budget this year we ve put wellbeing at the heart of the budget process wellbeing has certainly become something of a buzz word lately so i want to take the opportunity today to explain what the budget will mean for you your companies and for new zealand for me wellbeing means people living lives of purpose balance and meaning to them and having the capabilities to do so there are three fundamental elements to our wellbeing plan first a whole of government approach this is about stepping out of the silos of agencies and working together to assess develop and implement initiatives to improve wellbeing secondly a wellbeing approach means looking at intergenerational outcomes we have to think about the long term impacts on future generations at the same time as meeting the needs of the present thirdly we need to move beyond narrow measures of success the treasury s living standards framework is at the core of our approach to this budget but the government also has other success measures to draw on as well such as child wellbeing and poverty indicators and statistics new zealand s indicators aotearoa new zealand taken together these are steps forward in giving ourselves a much richer picture of how we are tracking as a country ultimately the wellbeing approach still needs to help us make better decisions identifying trade offs and balancing outcomes i m sure many of you will have experience in making difficult trade offs in the business world perhaps you ve had to weigh up a payoff in the short term and reputational impacts on your brand over the longer term a wellbeing approach is about taking a wider view recognising and weighing up the overall pros and cons of government policy on all of the things that enable new zealanders to live lives of purpose and value it is important to note that the wellbeing approach is more than just the budget our job is to ensure that the whole system of government is geared towards improving wellbeing and living standards the focus at budget time is on new spending but there is much to do to make sure that the baseline and core expenditure is aligned to our goals i will have more to say about this in the coming weeks but we have to ensure our legislative framework planning reporting and accountability arrangements shift to support the wellbeing approach functionally this requires a different approach to the way budgets have been done in the past previous budgets have essentially been a contestable fund individual agencies would develop and submit bids the finance minister and a small group of other ministers then made relatively arbitrary decisions on what would and wouldn t be funded so what is different about this budget fundamentally this year we have taken a much more strategic approach to the budget s development and production the budget priorities have been developed on the basis of a wellbeing analysis we have looked at the evidence to assess where we have the greatest opportunities to make a difference to new zealanders wellbeing and we have focused our efforts on those opportunities to inform this analysis we have drawn on demographic and other data from the treasury s living standards framework dashboard as well as other evidence and advice from science advisors and other sector experts this information does not necessarily tell us what interventions we should make but it shines a powerful light on where interventions are most needed and where we can make the biggest difference the wellbeing budget priorities developed from this approach are creating opportunities for productive businesses regions iwi and others to transition to a sustainable and low emissions economy supporting a thriving nation in the digital age through innovation social and economic opportunities reducing child poverty and improving child wellbeing including addressing family violence supporting mental wellbeing for all new zealanders with a special focus on under 24 year olds and lifting māori and pacific incomes skills and opportunities these represent some of the biggest long term challenges and opportunities that we face as a country they will not be solved in one go these are obviously complex multi faceted issues requiring sustained attention and a collaborative joined up government ultimately like in business investments should align with strategy i m sure all of you agree that expenditure should not be undertaken in isolation it needs to be in coordination and alignment with the outcomes you seek previously ministers and agencies have been able to focus almost exclusively on their particular areas of responsibility in the budget process but this year multiple agencies and ministers have been expected to contribute towards the budget priorities and to show how their proposals are contributing to overall wellbeing we know that the old silo approach has not worked complex issues like mental health climate change the future of work and child poverty require a multi agency collaborative approach we have been strongly encouraging collaboration among agencies in the development of budget bids i m excited by the joint initiatives that have come through this process for example last week we announced the wellbeing budget will contain funding for a new pathway for māori high security prisoners the initiative is co designed by whānau ora corrections the ministry of social development and iwi and aims to tackle the long term challenge of māori overrepresentation in the prison system in developing this initiative we looked at the evidence we know that 76 per cent of those in high security settings identify as either māori or pacific we also know that of that 76 percent some 53 percent of them are released from high security the reimprisonment rates of people released from high security are above 70 percent former chief science advisor sir peter gluckman noted that previous responses to addressing the incarceration rate for māori have largely been individualised ineffective and guided by non māori world views the new pathway will enable people to experience a māori and whānau centred approach for all of their time with corrections from pre sentence to reintegration and transition in their community it will initially focus on māori men under 30 years of age as this group has the highest reconviction and reimprisonment rates this initiative acknowledges that our system does not work for māori the answer is not just another programme this is a system change a culture change inside our prisons to adopt a strengths based approach to rehabilitation for me this is a great example of the wellbeing approach in action multiple agencies coming together to address a long term challenge with an evidence based and expert informed approach the payoff will be a long term one that will have massive social and economic benefits as former prime minister bill english once said prisons are a moral and fiscal failure this initiative is one step in turning that around this is just one example of how a wellbeing approach can influence policy formation and spending decisions for the better you will see many more examples like this in this year s budget while there will be many things that will be different in the wellbeing budget i want to be clear that it doesn t mean simply writing blank cheques to fix the current problems we see fiscal sustainability is an inherent part of a wellbeing approach it s about making sure we meet the challenges of today without compromising the ability of future generations to do so most of the focus during the budget process is usually on where new spending will be allocated but we also have to look at whether existing spending is delivering value for money and aligns with government priorities this isn t new and governments of all stripes have reviewed spending in the past taking a wellbeing approach doesn t mean backing away from this during this budget i asked all ministers to identify 1 percent of their baseline spending that was the lowest priority in their area this spending was then assessed on the basis of its effectiveness and alignment with the government s priorities out of this we have identified just over 1 billion worth of spending over the forecast period that is no longer a priority or where the funding allocated is no longer needed i can announce today that one example of this was underspending on the fees free programme due to enrolments not meeting initial forecasts this funding some 197 million is now to be redirected to the implementation of the reform of vocational education which education minister chris hipkins is working through i know from conversations over many years with this chamber that this is an area where you want reform and so do we put at its most simple we need to value apprenticeships trades and workplace training more we need it to be higher quality more accessible more coordinated and more relevant to businesses and regions the proposals are still being finalised but the reprioritisation of funding that i have announced today is an initial indication of our commitment to making this work without fail the first issue that businesses raise with me is the need for more skilled staff for new zealand to become a more productive nation it is vital for us to get this right these reforms are an important step in that direction getting it right requires partnership for us to achieve the wellbeing outcomes we seek we need to work with all our social partners including business andrew haldane chief economist at the bank of england provides an interesting link between wellbeing and economic growth he tracked phases of economic growth over centuries and noted that it has been the emergence of institutions that saw rises in human and social capital that were essential pre conditions for economic growth haldane divides these institutions into enabling institutions like free primary and secondary education that better equip the workforce and insuring institutions like central banks or trade unions that provide the cushion of certainty and support through periods of change change on an unprecedented scale is without doubt what we are all facing as we speak forces such as artificial intelligence globalisation big data and climate change are causing ongoing and lasting impacts on our economy and society so the government has a role to play in providing enabling and insuring institutions and working as a partner so that businesses and workers truly flourish in this period of rapid change it is my firm belief that lifelong learning is one of the enabling institutions for the coming decades that is why it is one of the four focus areas for the tripartite future of work forum that i lead with kirk hope and richard wagstaff through the forum we are jointly funding the skills shift initiative with the manufacturers network to map out the skills needed in that sector over the coming decades we see this as a pilot for other sectors to identify their skill needs and design the programmes needed for the future this focus on new skills is what lies behind fees free and the reform of vocational education it is why the prime minister s business advisory council have led the skills pledge a commitment for businesses to double their investment in workplace training over the next five years it is why we are investing more than ever in programmes like mana in mahi he poutama rangatahi and employing more case managers at work and income to support people into training and work and it was a significant topic of discussion at the just transition summit in taranaki last week in this area as in others it is not solely the government that drives change nor is the government solely responsible for improving wellbeing over the past decade or so more and more businesses have shifted their emphasis from solely financial measures of their success to include their social and environmental impacts as well this behaviour has not been driven by government regulation or intervention but by a desire to have the most productive and effective business possible a growing number of consumers are taking a keen interest in the ethical and environmental impacts of company supply chains firms that can demonstrate more ethical and responsible behaviours are at a competitive advantage with these consumers despite the potential added financial costs of doing so i know that as businesses you are constantly challenged to make change and take tough decisions to focus on the wellbeing of your staff the environment or society at large the wellbeing budget is our own first attempt we are not going to get things 100 right the first time around governments have been preparing budgets the same way for decades so this is a significant change but we are learning throughout this process and will look to improve it over years to come in closing i want to reiterate the difference we are making with this budget the wellbeing budget is about a new approach to tackling new zealand s long term challenges it is about a joined up government focused on building the capabilities of our future generations our priorities are clear we are taking mental health seriously breaking the cycle on child poverty and domestic violence investing in crucial national infrastructure like building new hospitals and schools while managing the books responsibly and addressing long term economic challenges like building a sustainable economy and preparing for the jobs of the future these problems have been ignored for too long we re proud to be getting on with the job of starting to fix the long term challenges facing new zealand and providing opportunity for all thank you content sourced from scoop co nz original url

dispute oil prices fell on monday as china retaliated against us tariffs despite earlier reports of attacks on saudi crude tankers brent dropped 0 96 percent and west texas intermediate 1 33 percent as global growth expectations were hit by the trade dispute escalation supply disruptions have been the biggest factor driving prices higher geopolitical disruptions like the us sanctions against iran and venezuela the russian contaminated supply and the coordinated output cut from the opec have moved prices higher the sabotage on saudi tankers at first was positive for crude prices but it was offset by the pessimism surrounding global trade a full blown trade war would have lasting consequences on global growth seriously limiting the upside for energy demand disruptions have balanced the market but lower demand and rising us production could make for a quick reversal the us china trade deal was all but signed 10 days ago and at this point it could be back on the table in the short term removing some of the downward pressure for crude but with higher disruptions to supply the agreement between opec and other major producers reaching an extension could be off the table political infighting at opec and russia s lack of commitment could end up disbanding the output limit deal leaving saudi arabia with much to ponder on how to rebalance the market by itself gold yellow metal

this index is similar to the overall nahb housing market index hmi but only released quarterly the nahb started this index in q4 2008 during the housing bust so the readings were initially very low from the nahb 55 housing market opens first quarter with record high builder confidence in the single family 55 housing market continued to strengthen in the first quarter of 2019 with a reading of 72 up six points from the previous quarter according to the national association of home builders nahb 55 housing market index hmi released today this is the highest reading since the inception of the index in 2008 overall demand for homes in 55 communities remain strong as more buyers and renters in that market search for simpler living arrangements said karen schroeder chair of nahb s 55 housing industry council and vice president of mayberry homes in east lansing mich however there are still headwinds that are impacting the market such as rising construction costs and a lack of skilled labor all three index components of the 55 single family hmi posted increases from the previous quarter present sales rose four points to 76 expected sales for the next six months increased seven points to 77 and traffic of prospective buyers climbed eight points to 61 emphasis added click on graph for larger image this graph shows the nahb 55 single family hmi through q1 2019 any reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than as poor the index increased to 72 in q1 up from 66 in q4 there are two key drivers in addition to the improved economy 1 there is a large cohort that recently moved into the 55 group and 2 the homeownership rate typically increases for people in the 55 to 70 year old age group so demographics are favorable for the 55 market
earlier this month the world gold council published its quarterly report and it shows that central banks and foreign governments from around the world are buying up gold at their fastest pace in six years this is pretty big news and it says a lot about the future of the dollar remember central banks and foreign governments hold literally trillions of dollars of reserves and traditionally they do this by buying us government debt it sounds strange but to big institutions banks etc us government debt is equivalent to cash they use it as a form of money more importantly they hold us dollars because that s the global standard the us dollar has been the world s primary international reserve currency for seventy five years so us debt is extremely liquid in fact the 22 trillion us debt market is the biggest and most liquid market in the world but foreign governments have started breaking with the tradition of buying treasuries as the world gold council s report showed us foreign governments and central banks have been buying a lot more gold than in previous years net gold purchases in q1 2019 among foreign governments and central banks was nearly 70 greater than q1 2018 and the highest rate of first quarter purchases in six years the chinese in particular have been stockpiling gold faster than ever while at the same time chinese ownership of us treasuries as a percentage of total holdings has been gradually declining over the past years and it s not just china russia turkey qatar and even colombia a long time ally of the us have been diversifying and buying a lot more gold there are a few obvious reasons behind that the debt of the us federal government recently reached 22 trillion and it isn t getting any better they add at least 1 trillion to the debt each year and the congressional budget office forecasts that the uncle sam will never again see an annual budget deficit of less than 1 trillion starting in 2021 that has serious impact on the ability of the us government to repay its obligations to foreign creditors and if the bolsheviks come to power next year and offer free goodies paid for with more debt to anyone with a pulse the debt burden will explode anyone who thinks owning 10 year us treasuries or even worse 30 year government bonds is risk free is completely insane the dollar s problems aren t limited to the us government s pitiful finances either even the federal reserve the central bank of the united states is close to insolvency according to its own financial statements and the fed s coffers are routinely plundered by congress in order to fund pet projects in washington it s so ridiculous that in late 2015 congress passed a law to steal 53 3 billion from the federal reserve putting the central bank on the brink of insolvency then of course there s the looming prospect of escalating us trade wars and it s easy to see why so many foreign governments and central banks are diversifying out of the dollar and into gold history shows that reserve currencies come and go there was a time when the british pound was the dominant currency in the world and before that dutch guilders spanish pieces of eight reserve currencies go all the way back before the gold solidus coin of the byzantine empire today the us dollar is the dominant currency in the world this is unlikely to change in the near future but it would be equally foolish to assume that the dollar s dominance will last forever gold on the other hand has been a constant of wealth preservation for nearly all of human history it was first used as money more than 3 000 years ago and an ounce of gold continues to buy roughly the same amount of goods over time there are a number of reasons for that gold is scarce portable and it can stand the test of time without corroding today i own gold as an insurance policy it s a form of wealth with no counter party risk and one that has global demand virtually anywhere you can possibly go in the world gold has value and it s definitely worth your consideration one interesting benefit we re living in a time where nearly every other asset is at an all time high stocks bonds real estate etc a single troy ounce of gold sells for nearly 50 below its record price from 2011 given what s happening with central banks foreign governments and us debt it s clear that demand is rising but simultaneously the supply of gold is under a lot of pressure we ve discussed before that large mines have been closing and large producers haven t invested in new discoveries so there could be significant potential for rising gold prices in the future
by riverfront investment management seven weeks ago we updated our three tactical rules 1 don t fight the fed 2 don t fight the trend and 3 beware of the crowd at extremes a lot has transpired in that short period of time first the federal reserve officially announced a revised balance sheet normalization plan that would slow the runoff of treasuries and mortgages starting in may and ending in september of this year second the s p 500 rose over 150 points from 2783 to its current level of 2939 finally additional progress was made in the trade negotiations between the us and china china s economic data improved and earnings season in the us is off to a better than expected start influencing investor sentiment below you will find a summary chart highlighting changes in the three rules since our march 11th weekly view now that the federal reserve rate hiking campaign has been taken off the table and the fed has stated its willingness to allow inflation levels to run above its 2 target for an extended period we believe that the fed continues to be supportive the fed s pausing has helped facilitate lower mortgage rates and to reinvigorate a slowing housing market the range for the fed funds rate is currently between 2 25 and 2 50 since our last update the probability of the fed funds rate being unchanged through december 2019 has fallen to 36 due to the market pricing in a 64 chance of at least one rate cut before year end a scenario that did not exist in march chart above although we believe that traders are now overly optimistic about the prospects of a rate cut we recognize that the fed is willing to respond quickly to softer data thus for now we believe the fed is on the investor s side source chicago mercantile exchange cme group riverfront past performance is no guarantee of future results not indicative of riverfront performance internationally while the backdrop of central bank policy is accommodative in europe and asia we believe further stimulus is necessary given the tepid trajectory of growth hence our neutral view in china the peoples bank of china pboc is providing its own version of quantitative easing and we view the central bank guidance as bullish the trend which we define as the s p 500 s 200 day moving average smooth line right chart flattened after the s p 500 s high of 2940 in september 2018 the subsequent 6 months consisted of the s p 500 trading in a range past performance is no guarantee of future results shown for illustrative purposes and not indicative of riverfront performance see disclosures for index definitions however now that the s p is nearing its all time trading high the trend has steepened and turned positive this is a significant change from seven weeks ago reflecting accelerating momentum due to investors embracing the return of chinese growth and better than expected first quarter earnings by us companies we wrote on march 11th that the trend was at a crossroad if it turned positive the odds for a positive return over the next three months would improve above the long term average when combined with current sentiment levels however a decidedly negative turn of the trend would warrant caution the former scenario is playing out and therefore we rate the trend overall as bullish past performance is no guarantee of future results shown for illustrative purposes and not indicative of riverfront performance see disclosures for index definitions internationally the positive economic growth in china combined with de escalating trade tensions has turned the trend from negative to flat as shown by the smooth line in the chart bottom right of the msci all country world ex us index we are encouraged by the index rising above its 200 day moving average beware of the crowd at extremes sentiment is a contrary indicator at extremes analyze sentiment by determining if it is sustainable at current levels if sentiment is identified to be unsustainable then as investors we should be willing to lean in the other direction and be prepared to act more aggressively once the condition changes current condition us extreme optimism international neutral given the s p 500 s strong start to 2019 investors fear of missing out could drive the crowd to reach higher extremes of optimism as sidelined investors are enticed to chase returns we use crowd sentiment polls from ned davis research ndr to help gauge whether the crowd has reached optimistic or pessimistic extremes as can be seen in the chart below ndr s sentiment poll has moved further into extreme optimism territory over the last seven weeks suggesting that we should continue to be more cautious going forward extreme optimism can resolve itself in one of two ways either the market can decline making investors less optimistic or simply consolidate trend sideways until the condition fades we have found judging the crowd to be important however we recognize that crowd sentiment signals often require additional interpretation for instance when extreme optimism is combined with a positive trend which is the current condition in the us markets have historically tended to grind higher over time today we believe that the us market will encounter some resistance at the s p s historical highs and will be range bound until it can work off the high levels of investor optimism while there is no comparable sentiment indicator for international equities we judge international sentiment to be relatively neutral past performance is no guarantee of future results 2019 ned davis research inc further distribution prohibited without prior permission all rights reserved see ndr disclaimer at www ndr com copyright html for data disclaimers refer to www ndr com vendorinfo the final verdict we believe the fed is on the investors side the trend is positive but the crowd is too optimistic net net the conditions for our three tactical rules have improved from neutral to positive therefore we believe that it is appropriate to remain slightly overweight equities given our view of the low probability of a recession and reasonable valuation levels important disclosure information the comments

president sprinkled his criticisms of china over the last 48 hours with enough signals that negotiations haven t completely broken down that traders rushed back into the beaten down market to find bargains but the rally remains tenuous as the white house announced it was prepping tariffs on the remaining us 300 billion of chinese imports and economists warned the new penalties will eventually weigh heavily on the american economy in one year tariffs have rebuilt our steel industry it is booming we placed a 25 tariff on dumped steel from china other countries and we now have a big and growing industry we had to save steel for our defense and auto industries both of which are coming back strong donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 14 2019 china buys much less from us than we buy from them by almost 500 billion dollars so we are in a fantastic position make your product at home in the usa and there is no tariff you can also buy from a non tariffed country instead of china many companies are leaving china donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 14 2019 so that they will be more competitive for usa buyers we are now a much bigger economy than china and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 election we are the piggy bank that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of no more donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 14 2019 we can make a deal with china tomorrow before their companies start leaving so as not to lose usa business but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal no way we are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made will be taking in donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 14 2019 billions of dollars and moving jobs back to the usa where they belong other countries are already negotiating with us because they don t want this to happen to them they must be a part of usa action this should have been done by our leaders many years ago enjoy donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 14 2019 when the time is right we will make a deal with china my respect and friendship with president xi is unlimited but as i have told him many times before this must be a great deal for the united states or it just doesn t make any sense we have to be allowed to make up some donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 14 2019 of the tremendous ground we have lost to china on trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the wto it will all happen and much faster than people think donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 14 2019 our great patriot farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now hopefully china will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product the best but if not your country will be making up the difference based on a very high china buy donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 14 2019 this money will come from the massive tariffs being paid to the united states for allowing china and others to do business with us the farmers have been forgotten for many years their time is now donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 14 2019 here are some notable events coming up this week earnings this week include alibaba tencent cisco nvidia kansas city fed president

reading time 4 minutes this article has been updated colombia s president iván duque campaigned on a promise to ignite the economy through entrepreneurship by the end of 2018 he had raised funds on the bond market for creative economy startups and incentivized small businesses with tax breaks it seemed like the economics savvy leader was cruising along until a blizzard of budget problems buried him up to his chin the administration is now struggling to meet its fiscal deficit rule a budget target written into the constitution and watched carefully by investors and credit rating agencies as duque looks for ways to shore up colombia s finances observers and some in the administration have suggested he may be forced to privatize government holdings in national champions like ecopetrol the state controlled oil firm duque s finance minister alberto carrasquilla told reporters in january that the administration is mulling what it could sell from a list of 100 companies in which the government holds shares worth a total of around 50 billion on may 14 bloomberg reported that the government was preparing to sell some or all of its 51 stake in electric utility isa a sale that would be worth some 2 7 billion further sales of state assets are expected however necessary privatization carries significant political risks and could shake up colombian elections well into the future duque would be wary of the likely backlash from growing leftist forces when considering privatizing these assets especially with local and regional elections in october said antonia eklund a senior analyst at control risks a political risk consultancy in the scenario that partial privatizations advance under duque it would likely serve as fodder for the left s agenda in 2022 duque may not have a choice already under strain colombia s fiscal outlook has been complicated by large scale migration from venezuela as the government searches for new sources of tax revenue and clamps down on tax evasion it is also now being forced to factor in the future costs of treating venezuelan migrants in emergency rooms and supporting their children in classrooms across the country unfortunately as a country we haven t figured out how to finance these constitutional obligations said nelson vera an economist at anif a think tank in bogotá the un projects that venezuela s diaspora will reach 5 4 million by the end of 2019 up from 3 4 million at the end of 2018 at that rate colombia could become home to at least 2 million refugees by the end of this year last year duque estimated venezuelan refugees would cost colombia half a percent of gdp per year or about 1 5 billion control risks thinks the cost of venezuelan refugees this year could be north of 0 6 of gdp if duque does ultimately opt to privatize the most likely target would be a 10 to 12 stake in ecopetrol according to control risks that would shore up the government s finances in the short term but would come with several complications privatizing a crown jewel like ecopetrol or isa the state controlled transmission firm would likely be met with staunch resistance ecopetrol is a profitable company and its unions which want full nationalization would likely politicize the sale that could give nationalist factions on both sides of the spectrum power duque has failed on his campaign promise to overcome polarization since moving further to the right and strengthening the likelihood of a leading leftist candidate of the ilk of gustavo petro in 2022 eklund said a botched privatization process would contribute to the consolidation of the latter another problem is that colombian law says the government must keep at least 80 of its stake in ecopetrol depending on how much money it needed to raise that could push the administration to try to change the law or sell other assets like shares in isa duque would have to fight for his right to sell in congress where he is so far unloved past experience shows that privatization in latin america has come with political consequences in the late 1990s the world bank loaded pressure onto bolivia to privatize water supply and sanitation infrastructure in order to keep their loans then president hugo banzer met fierce popular protest from students and unions among them the coca growers union a key figure during the spat was evo morales who won the presidency in 2005 and has held power ever since privatizations were associated with economic mismanagement in the 1990s in argentina that led former president cristina fernández de kirchner to re nationalize the former state oil company ypf in 2012 in colombia the worry is that a nationalist government would scare away foreign investment low approval ratings will not make privatization easy for duque any privatization effort will likely be unpopular and meet legal action former president juan manuel santos launched the sale of a controlling stake in isagen a state run power utility in 2013 it dragged on for 30 months before the transaction with brookfield the buyer closed that s time duque does not have looking ahead duque s party is hoping to gain popularity as they head into local and regional elections in october of this year duque could actually take a tip from the isagen sale which santos successfully executed in the face of popular resistance the 2 billion it raised helped capitalize colombia s fdn a local financing institution for the country s much needed infrastructure upgrades part of the isagen privatization success came from santos selling it as a good deal colombians would get better roads in exchange for giving up the utility anif a colombian think tank thinks duque should do something similar it will be key for duque to show the public that he s trading in public assets for more than just some extra pocket change while a tax reform passed at the end of 2018 put the deficit on track for 2019 it s 2020 and beyond that could present a problem congress in april relaxed the fiscal rule from 2 4 of gdp to 2 7 of gdp that buys them some time the finance ministry also wants to do everything possible to resolve the remainder of the budget shortfall with debt financing before they take a step toward privatizations anif argues that no matter what colombia needs another tax reform to stabilize its public debt in the long term meanwhile the state has grown the public debt by 12 each year for the last 10 years and many in bogotá worry that taking on more debt is unsustainable in spite of the political risks the pressure is on to privatize after all it doesn t seem that the costs of venezuelan migration are going to let up anytime soon this piece was updated to reflect news that colombia s government was preparing to sell its stake in the electric utility isa tomaselli is a freelance journalist and researcher based in colombia

although markets are quick to respond to individual events such as a populist party s rise to power or the introduction of a tax cut or spending increase they have yet to grasp how populist policies could affect the global economy over the long term this poses a challenge for investors who need to understand the economics of populism to effectively navigate the changing market environment in the years ahead redistribution is key to populist thinking the key economic objective of populism is the redistribution of wealth and income from a corrupt elite to virtuous ordinary people this is true for both right wing and left wing populists although they disagree on who qualifies as ordinary and who doesn t to achieve redistribution populists typically favour loose fiscal programmes combined with policies that directly challenge central bank independence corporate governance and property rights typically this approach has resulted in negative economic outcomes such as unsustainable fiscal deficits high inflation and weaker currencies which eventually lead to slower capital formation as business confidence ebbs while growth might initially be supported by some of these policies it is likely to suffer over the longer term as their effects mature economically this picture resembles the united states in the 1970s a decade in which both inequality and profit margins fell meaningfully the economic policies of the period were characterized by a combination of price controls to limit inflation and expansionary fiscal policies to support real income growth enacted against a backdrop of shocks from rising oil prices these policies caused equity markets to rise well below inflation nominal bond yields to rise while real yields fell and the dollar to depreciate against other major currencies pressure on central banks to adopt accommodative monetary policies will typically lead to increased inflation expectations steeper yield curves lower real yields and currency depreciation at the same time the push for income redistribution and higher wages reduces profit margins which in combination with rising macro uncertainty challenges equity valuations both sovereign and corporate credit spreads can be expected to widen when governments undertake fiscal expansion amid a backdrop of limited fiscal space the early signs of this can be glimpsed in president trump s deficit financed tax cuts and the ruling italian populist coalition s battles with the european union eu to push through an expansionary budget faced with loose fiscal policies and reduced property rights investors in countries ruled by populist leaders are likely to turn to inflation linked bonds real assets and gold which may perform well during periods of rising uncertainty and heightened inflation investors are also likely to avoid the currencies of populist ruled countries boosting the currencies of countries with more mainstream governments how does it end it is unlikely that the current generation of populist politicians will deliver the income redistribution and social mobility that their base demands jobs that have been outsourced to other countries cannot easily be repatriated and excessively loose fiscal policies invariably have outcomes that dent business confidence and reduce capital formation and job creation i e the initiatives are a drag on growth which probably makes income redistribution and social mobility harder not easier to deliver but it would be a mistake to think that the potential failure of populist politicians will lead to the early demise of populist politics voters demands for greater equality and social mobility will not be silenced until they have been met and if the first populist government that is voted into power fails to deliver voters are more likely to elect another populist candidate than to vote for mainstream candidates moreover it is not only populist alternative candidates who promise greater equality and mobility incumbent politicians are likely to shift their stances to address the populist threat to keep populist politicians from power mainstream parties will find that they must offer a viable alternative that is center right parties must shift further right and center left must shift further left in this way populist movements can exert considerable influence over policy without actually gaining power the path forward is fraught with uncertainty it is important for investors to embrace the possibility that the populist movement is a long term structural phenomenon and if it is it will have long term mainly negative economic outcomes nikolaj schmidt chief international economist at t rowe price
reading time 4 minutes this article has been updated colombia s president iván duque campaigned on a promise to ignite the economy through entrepreneurship by the end of 2018 he had raised funds on the bond market for creative economy startups and incentivized small businesses with tax breaks it seemed like the economics savvy leader was cruising along until a blizzard of budget problems buried him up to his chin the administration is now struggling to meet its fiscal deficit rule a budget target written into the constitution and watched carefully by investors and credit rating agencies as duque looks for ways to shore up colombia s finances observers and some in the administration have suggested he may be forced to privatize government holdings in national champions like ecopetrol the state controlled oil firm duque s finance minister alberto carrasquilla told reporters in january that the administration is mulling what it could sell from a list of 100 companies in which the government holds shares worth a total of around 50 billion on may 14 bloomberg reported that the government was preparing to sell some or all of its 51 stake in electric utility isa a sale that would be worth some 2 7 billion further sales of state assets are expected however necessary privatization carries significant political risks and could shake up colombian elections well into the future duque would be wary of the likely backlash from growing leftist forces when considering privatizing these assets especially with local and regional elections in october said antonia eklund a senior analyst at control risks a political risk consultancy in the scenario that partial privatizations advance under duque it would likely serve as fodder for the left s agenda in 2022 duque may not have a choice already under strain colombia s fiscal outlook has been complicated by large scale migration from venezuela as the government searches for new sources of tax revenue and clamps down on tax evasion it is also now being forced to factor in the future costs of treating venezuelan migrants in emergency rooms and supporting their children in classrooms across the country unfortunately as a country we haven t figured out how to finance these constitutional obligations said nelson vera an economist at anif a think tank in bogotá the un projects that venezuela s diaspora will reach 5 4 million by the end of 2019 up from 3 4 million at the end of 2018 at that rate colombia could become home to at least 2 million refugees by the end of this year last year duque estimated venezuelan refugees would cost colombia half a percent of gdp per year or about 1 5 billion control risks thinks the cost of venezuelan refugees this year could be north of 0 6 of gdp if duque does ultimately opt to privatize the most likely target would be a 10 to 12 stake in ecopetrol according to control risks that would shore up the government s finances in the short term but would come with several complications privatizing a crown jewel like ecopetrol or isa the state controlled transmission firm would likely be met with staunch resistance ecopetrol is a profitable company and its unions which want full nationalization would likely politicize the sale that could give nationalist factions on both sides of the spectrum power duque has failed on his campaign promise to overcome polarization since moving further to the right and strengthening the likelihood of a leading leftist candidate of the ilk of gustavo petro in 2022 eklund said a botched privatization process would contribute to the consolidation of the latter another problem is that colombian law says the government must keep at least 80 of its stake in ecopetrol depending on how much money it needed to raise that could push the administration to try to change the law or sell other assets like shares in isa duque would have to fight for his right to sell in congress where he is so far unloved past experience shows that privatization in latin america has come with political consequences in the late 1990s the world bank loaded pressure onto bolivia to privatize water supply and sanitation infrastructure in order to keep their loans then president hugo banzer met fierce popular protest from students and unions among them the coca growers union a key figure during the spat was evo morales who won the presidency in 2005 and has held power ever since privatizations were associated with economic mismanagement in the 1990s in argentina that led former president cristina fernández de kirchner to re nationalize the former state oil company ypf in 2012 in colombia the worry is that a nationalist government would scare away foreign investment low approval ratings will not make privatization easy for duque any privatization effort will likely be unpopular and meet legal action former president juan manuel santos launched the sale of a controlling stake in isagen a state run power utility in 2013 it dragged on for 30 months before the transaction with brookfield the buyer closed that s time duque does not have looking ahead duque s party is hoping to gain popularity as they head into local and regional elections in october of this year duque could actually take a tip from the isagen sale which santos successfully executed in the face of popular resistance the 2 billion it raised helped capitalize colombia s fdn a local financing institution for the country s much needed infrastructure upgrades part of the isagen privatization success came from santos selling it as a good deal colombians would get better roads in exchange for giving up the utility anif a colombian think tank thinks duque should do something similar it will be key for duque to show the public that he s trading in public assets for more than just some extra pocket change while a tax reform passed at the end of 2018 put the deficit on track for 2019 it s 2020 and beyond that could present a problem congress in april relaxed the fiscal rule from 2 4 of gdp to 2 7 of gdp that buys them some time the finance ministry also wants to do everything possible to resolve the remainder of the budget shortfall with debt financing before they take a step toward privatizations anif argues that no matter what colombia needs another tax reform to stabilize its public debt in the long term meanwhile the state has grown the public debt by 12 each year for the last 10 years and many in bogotá worry that taking on more debt is unsustainable in spite of the political risks the pressure is on to privatize after all it doesn t seem that the costs of venezuelan migration are going to let up anytime soon this piece was updated to reflect news that colombia s government was preparing to sell its stake in the electric utility isa tomaselli is a freelance journalist and researcher based in colombia

open this photo in gallery bond prices which move in the opposite direction to interest rates should benefit as central banks including the bank of canada cut rates to support sputtering expansions richard drew the associated press bonds are a better bet than stocks over the next year according to a widely followed u k economics forecasting firm the s p 500 and other stock markets are likely to lose ground in coming months as they grapple with stubbornly slow global growth according to london based capital economics which hosted a conference in toronto on tuesday but bond prices which move in the opposite direction to interest rates should benefit as central banks including the bank of canada cut rates to support sputtering expansions growth will slow most everywhere over the next 12 to 18 months group chief economist neil shearing told the audience but no he added this will not be a repeat of the financial crisis unlike the 2008 downturn which was rooted in one massive problem of housing related debt the current sluggishness reflects a host of national or even local problems he said earthquakes and typhoons in japan faltering export growth in germany fiscal woes in italy slower credit growth in china and past interest rate hikes in the united states are among the culprits if these combine to drag on global growth in coming months as capital economics expects corporate profits will suffer and stock prices will come under pressure the forecaster predicts the s p 500 index in the united states will finish the year around 2 300 nearly 20 per cent lower than it now stands other global stock markets will also suffer double digit losses bonds in contrast should do well as interest rates slide the yield on the 10 year u s treasury bond the most widely followed global benchmark for long term interest rates will fall to 2 25 per cent by year end from its current level around 2 45 per cent mr shearing predicted canadian interest rates will follow suit as a cooling housing market chills the economy according to stephen brown senior canada economist at the forecaster he is not calling for a housing collapse but rather modest decreases in home prices in key markets such as toronto and vancouver where home prices have soared beyond the reach of most households even a restrained downturn is still likely to have significant ripple effects however residential investment has accounted for more than 7 per cent of canada s gross domestic product gdp in recent years well above the long term average of 5 8 per cent so any slowdown in that sector leaves a large gap to be filled especially with oil prices still too low to prompt a new burst of oil patch investment the full effects of the housing downturn are yet to be felt mr brown said to offset the impact of the housing slowdown he predicts the bank of canada will have to chop its current policy interest rate of 1 75 per cent by more than markets expect he expects the rate to tumble to 1 25 per cent by the end of this year and 1 per cent by the end of 2020 on a more upbeat note other speakers noted that the china u s trade war is likely to have smaller effects than many investors fear exports to china amount to less than 1 per cent of u s gdp from china s perspective the impact is limited as well the loss to china from current u s tariffs amounts to only 0 3 per cent of gdp they said but that doesn t mean china is set to roar again while short term drags on the chinese economy are fading any rebound will be small according to capital economics forecasts the size of the chinese work force has peaked and beijing has grown wary of the costs of unrestrained stimulus combined with the fading stimulus from tax cuts in the u s economy the brexit mess in the u k and a still challenging outlook for the euro zone economy the forecast for the world as a whole is continued slow growth against a backdrop of restrained inflation mr shearing said

expand close at first glance 2017 was not the best year for foreign direct investment fdi in canada fdi inflows into canada decreased by 36 4 percent to 31 5 billion mainly due to an overall decline in global fdi which fell by 23 percent to 1 43 trillion important divestitures by foreign based companies in the oil and mining sectors in canada also contributed to the decline of fdi inflows although there was a general decrease of inflows from the u s into canada the decline in fdi from other parts of the world was much more pronounced however as erik hertzberg journalist for bloomberg wrote outside of oil and gas foreign investors haven t given up on the canadian economy in fact the manufacturing sector did incredibly well in 2017 fdi inflows in manufacturing showed an impressive 94 5 percent increase in 2017 almost doubling since 2016 a clear indicator that canada is a destination of choice for growing manufacturing companies fdi stock measures the total level of direct investment at a given point in time in canada excluding oil and gas from the equation it grew by 4 7 percent a larger increase than in the past two years including oil and gas in the evaluation of fdi stock results in a 1 9 percent increase during the past year furthermore although the manufacturing sector did not drive the growth in fdi stock it still holds the largest share at 21 4 percent followed closely by the management of companies and enterprises sector totaling 20 7 percent in recent years the canadian government has been making fdi a priority namely by improving the fdi attraction strategy and program structure the advisory council on economic growth established by canada s minister of finance mentioned in its bringing foreign direct investment to canada report that there is no clear national strategy resulting in many initiatives being introduced in the 2017 federal budget those initiatives include innovation canada a one stop shop for innovating businesses that need support and funding the clean growth hub a group dedicated to guiding clean technology producers through the various services and programs applicable to them and the innovation superclusters initiative a program supporting business led innovation superclusters in various industries such as advanced manufacturing artificial intelligence and clean resources the federal government also simplified its program offerings by consolidating innovation funding programs resulting in a more cost effective overall structure the strategic innovation fund sif is a product of the consolidation of various innovation programs with a total budget of 1 26 billion over five years to support large projects leading to significant investment and job growth the launch of invest in canada by the government of canada in march 2018 marked an important development for fdi attraction and the jobs that come with it the organization was created to position canada as a top destination for global investment and to make it easy for investors to build innovative and global businesses in canada the establishment of a federal government agency dedicated to fdi attraction is a first time development for canada and sends a clear message to foreign investors that canada intends to pull its weight on the global stage canada has an extraordinarily positive global brand by leveraging that we can highlight canada s status as a premier investment destination says invest in canada ceo ian mckay companies that are already invested in canada are expanding rapidly and those that are not yet here are having a good hard look at all of our competitive advantages talent market access and a best in class business environment the nafta renegotiations began on august 2017 and since then a number of chapters have been successfully updated and closed the presidential elections in mexico have put the negotiating sessions on hold since may but as of this writing they were scheduled to resume in august recently the u s applied a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from canada and other countries claiming a risk to national security as per the trade expansion act of 1962 the u s is also hinting at an automobile tariff in the near future an industry with heavily integrated supply chains in every nafta country this could potentially prove more damaging than the current tariffs on steel and aluminum following these new tariffs many countries canada included have retaliated with tariffs on american products such as steel aluminum and various food products resulting in a situation that is now being described as a trade war although the nafta renegotiations and a trade war between canada and the u s are two entirely separate issues they nonetheless affect one another and the relationship between the two long term allies it is safe to say that the north american business community has remained in a state of uncertainty since the beginning of the nafta renegotiations last year what was once a stable and successful agreement since its signature in 1994 has now become a source of concern for all parties involved nafta after 25 years is due for a tune up but it is the framework for an integrated north american economy that has benefited all three partners significantly says mckay adding ceta cptpp and all of canada s bilateral trade deals investors here have unfettered access to a market of 1 7 billion consumers canada is well positioned to tackle the challenges of the 21st century economy and global investors are recognizing that although the global context is tainted with uncertainty and the business relationship between canada and the u s has become unstable our businesses are pursuing their expansion projects increasing their competitiveness and creating quality jobs says carl viel president and ceo of québec international a public agency pursuing inward fdi attraction for the québec city metropolitan region representatives from economic development agencies in montreal toronto and vancouver are also seeing normal growth in their respective business environments in other words tangible impacts of the nafta renegotiations are not yet being observed in the canadian business environment raymond bachand quebec s chief negotiator for nafta claims that canada s value proposition has actually improved in recent months in terms of workforce immigration policies research and development skills and the government s financial health dominique anglade quebec s deputy premier and minister of economy science and innovation who is responsible for its digital strategy believes that this continuous economic strength results from the fact that with regard to attracting fdi we are a very stable region that is well positioned in terms of talent costs and access to market as a matter of fact according to the world bank s doing business 2018 report canada is the 18th easiest country to do business in among 190 economies as previously mentioned canada is also a member of major free trade agreements namely nafta ceta with the european union and the cptpp with pacific rim countries providing access to a large and diversified market an important attraction tool to bring in foreign investors although canada s business environment is still showing evident signs of economic prosperity the current context seems to be making some foreign investors hesitant when it comes time to finalize an investment in the region what we are seeing is a delay in making final decisions around investments because investors want to make sure that the uncertainty is behind them outside of oil and gas foreign investors haven t given up on the canadian economy erik hertzberg journalist bloomberg although most individuals were hoping for the agreement to be finalized in 2018 nafta renegotiations have not yet neared a conclusion as of may 17th which was the deadline on an impending nafta deal set by the u s congress knowing that it could take up to six months for congress to vote on a new agreement and with the u s midterm elections to occur in november it is highly unlikely that a new and improved nafta will be unveiled prior to 2019 with the world economy buffeted by the strongest challenges to globalization in the past 50 years investors are being confronted with a higher degree of uncertainty as a country that is a 10th of the size of its largest trading partner and immediate neighbor canada does not have the same clout to influence the global trading system as its partners however canada is betting that maintaining and deepening economic ties to the rest of the world will ensure its continued growth canada will continue to promote fdi by maintaining an open economy by investing in its workforce through both education and an open immigration system it will continue to provide the highly trained personnel sought by investors furthermore by engaging in regional trade partnerships that stretch across the globe it will ensure that the country will continue to be integrated into global supply chains the message being sent is that canada will be an attractive destination for foreign investment in the coming years no matter what happens to the global economy

massive clean up undertaking this is the sixth in an eight part series that takes an incisive look at the bermuda economy historically from our humble beginnings to the 21st century and the challenges faced by the progressive labour party government war continued to influence the direction of the bermudian economy in the latter part of the 20th century when the american bases were established the population expanded by 20 per cent to 25 per cent when they closed in 1995 it is estimated that gross national product shrunk by 20 per cent the building of the bases made bermuda a us dollar surplus earner england was desperate for us dollars so that she could purchase war supplies thus the bermuda banks were able to sell their dollars to england at a premium bermudians realised that there was money to be made in international finance american international set up in bermuda in 1940 having followed one or two other companies that had come to bermuda for their own business reasons more than 1 000 companies have followed suit since then american neutrality law required that england purchase its war materials on the basis of cash and carry england had already defaulted on its first world war debt england s desperation for us dollars was amplified in the summer of 1940 when the english cabinet discussed ending the war in the end the english strategised in august 1940 to continue placing orders for materials in the expectation that america would see that its only hope of recovering payment would be for the english to win the war as there would be no hope of recovery if the germans won in which case the americans were forced to continue fulfilling the orders on december 8 1940 sir winston churchill wrote to franklin d roosevelt frankly stating that england had come to the end of her rope for military materials and begged roosevelt to find ways to help britain in their common cause both roosevelt and henry morgenthau jr the secretary of the treasury were personally opposed to the idea of germany winning the war they demanded that england demonstrate that she was bankrupt by selling off her american assets morgan stanley had its eyes on the largest asset that england owned in the united states american viscose corporation which in the end it was able to purchase for less than half price the white house was then able to get the land lease bill through congress after the war john keynes expected the americans to cancel the debt seeing as how england was left to fight the war alone before america joined the effort the best he could negotiate was a 50 year loan at 2 per cent interest the more long term solution was the marshall plan which was owing more to joseph stalin than england s special relationship with the americans when stalin took over eastern europe the americans concluded that he would take over the whole of europe if more of its help was not forthcoming bermuda also made a contribution to the war effort when the americans departed bermuda they left behind a 100 million environmental clean up bill both the americans and the british insisted that they were not going to pay for the clean up as the military bases were downsizing primarily the americans but also the smaller nato contingents of english and canadians international business was expanding by 1990 international business had taken over from tourism as the leading sector of the bermuda economy bermuda s location has always been one of her main selling points apart from travel by ships and aircraft as early as 1890 the island was connected to halifax by underwater cable less than two days by ship and less than two hours by flight bermuda is next door to new york one of the largest commercial centres in the world it is in a time zone one hour ahead of new york and four hours behind london with its pristine beauty and friendly but sophisticated population it is an extremely hospitable place from which to do business the island is politically and socially stable which makes the life of the businessman predictable and free from guesswork it has a westminster political system with an independent judiciary for which the english privy council is the final court of appeal the small size of the island and relatively small size of the population make internal communications personal and free from cumbersome bureaucracies the regulatory environment provides safety without being unnecessarily restrictive it is tax neutral and free from ideological confrontations being the first of the smaller financial jurisdictions bermuda has been responsive to new financial technologies and developed special expertise in certain areas such as insurance she is the world leader in captive insurance and reinsurance companies the captive insurance companies alone have more than 85 billion in assets she manages innumerable investment funds trusts and cutting edge insurance linked securities bermuda has gone to the forefront of solvency ii regulations thereby promoting investments from european pension funds the bermuda stock exchange is fully electronic offering a full range of listings and is a member of the world federation of exchanges the bermuda development agency is a government supported marketing agency that seeks to give personalised assistance to companies contemplating setting up in bermuda most bermudians believe that bermuda is another world whose sound economic and social policies can become an example for the rest of the world this is consistent with acts 17 26 27 where we are told that the purpose of god in dividing up people into nations was so that one of them would seek after him he deliberately chose israel because israel was small as is bermuda contrary to the above bermudians then go on to limit themselves but for our political leaders the average bermudian is sufficiently self confident to believe that we are able to produce our own experts there is no other country that bermudians believe we should model what bermudians lack is the courage to select leaders who believe as they do what is the impact of government on the economic system both in making the laws and the administration of those laws the judaic system recognised the role of moses and the priests in making and administering the rules of their society they may be equated to today s cabinet and civil servants the priest of israel had a right to be supported but it was not based on a coercive system of taxation but on voluntary sacrifices this was a tremendous incentive for them acting as civil servants to give good service ancient judaic law is not quite so remote as one is tempted to think if you incur a debt today it cannot be enforced after six years this idea came straight out of ancient judaic law this is worth mentioning for the sake of those who think that judaic law is too ancient to be relevant many aspects of judaic thinking on the subject of the economy continues with us today the judaic economic system underpinned serfdom mercantilism free enterprise and socialism it is the judaic system which moses gave to the nation of israel when they first occupied present day palestine israel at that time was a society of farmers as was the case of europe in the middle ages in israel the ownership of the land was in the hands of families as was the case during the period of serfdom but unlike serfdom in israel a man s freedom to sell his land was limited in israel the land came back to the family in the year of jubilee thus the system contained elements of serfdom as well as elements of the free enterprise system a land transaction was limited it was more in the nature of a lease equal to possession for 50 years of course productivity requires labour but the circumstances in which labour is acquired is crucial all workers are not the same for example in bermuda at its beginning labour was drawn from slavery the conditions of slavery have left an imprint on black bermuda society that makes it very different from white bermuda society even within bermuda s white society there are differences these differences are more than individual the differences become characteristic of large groups within the labour market in any system of productivity it is important to have access to capital this is so whether you are living in judaic times or serfdom times even though capital is far more important today than it was in either of those historic periods of equal importance is specialisation and having the right to engage in trade even though this right may be taken for granted today it is not a right that was always extended to all critical to the mercantile system was the exclusive right given to some allowing them to trade adam smith s main criticism of the mercantile system was the inability of those without a licence to trade in foreign lands all of which brings us to the question what do you think are the ideas that should be incorporated in what could be sound economic rules for a new bermuda for the long run perhaps that question should really be prefaced by another question do bermudians think they can do better than they have done in the past and do they think that they can do better than the rest of the world if the answer to those questions is no then of course there is nothing to be done except follow the rest of the world what then are some of the directions in which we can move the scarcest thing that the underprivileged needs is wealth capital without wealth the only thing that stands between an income and unemployment is financial assistance as a matter of fact the policy of the department of financial assistance is to ensure that a person has no wealth at all before they can claim financial assistance every family in bermuda should be encouraged to accumulate some level of wealth the government should have a policy to encourage the accumulation of wealth the usual way in which wealth is accumulated is through savings programmes which is unlikely since those who need it most have the most difficulty in doing it thus it will be necessary to find some kind of coercive means to force people to save in much the same way that the pension fund is operated the manner in which land was used by the ancient israelis was a good example of a compromise between allowing some degree of freedom of choice but not so much that a family could become trapped in poverty for generations for example belco and other utilities such as banks could have a billing programme that requires the consumer to acquire shares in the company dealing with these specially acquired shares should be limited to sale and purchase of other such shares of what may be called heritage products the law could limit dealings in heritage shares in much the same way that trustees are limited by law in the way they can deal with trust funds any alienation of the capital could also be limited in terms of time living accommodation may be regarded as a consumption item or it may be viewed as an investment item in any event the government has already taken steps to ensure the availability of housing it simply has to be refined and expanded bermuda has also developed a policy where homeowners are encouraged to build an apartment which is definitely an item of wealth incorporated into their home the need now is to develop a method whereby such apartments can be treated legally as a separate entity to the home financial institutions can fulfil the needs of what has been called heritage projects but also venture projects for the small and middle sized businesses in much the same way that the government intervened to assist the bermuda development company not only in 1920 when they began but also in the 1990s when tucker s point was being redeveloped bermuda should also explore the possibilities existing with the caribbean reparations commission this is a regional body created to establish the moral ethical and legal case for the payment of reparations by the governments of all the former colonial powers and the relevant institutions of those countries to the nations and people of the caribbean community for the crimes against humanity of native genocide the transatlantic slave trade and a racialised system of chattel slavery in the past government has been a source of capital for both heritage projects as well as venture projects but as a source of such capital it has operated in favour only of those who don t need it for example the government invested very heavily in the bermuda development company at its inception in 1920 and again at its point or redevelopment in the 1990s there is no business reason why the millions of dollars that were invested could not represent equity held in some form by bermuda families of course there are many government and institutional funds that can be used within the limits of wise financial management arthur hodgson is a former cabinet minister rhodes scholar and graduate of

the industrial sector the world s two largest economies had seemed to be on track to resolve the ongoing trade dispute that has raised prices for consumers and pinched corporate profit margins hopes for a resolution had helped push the market to its best yearly start in decades those hopes are now replaced by concerns that a full blown trade war could crimp what is otherwise a mostly healthy economy the larger issue with the tariffs isn t the specific amounts of tariffs at any given time but the uncertainty that s surrounding these tariffs and the what s next of an escalating trade war

overall rank prime workforce economic strength year over year growth midterm five year growth the u s economic outlook is healthy according to according to the key economic indicators with the gdp growth rate expected to remain between 2 and 3 percent unemployment hovering just below 4 percent and inflation or deflation in check for now there s a general feeling of optimism sweeping much of the nation as of may the u s economy had expanded for 107 months making it the second longest expansion on record tax cuts low unemployment and rising wages point to more spending power to fuel economic growth says dr christine chmura ceo and chief economist at chmura economics analytics increased investment by businesses in new plants and equipment resulting from corporate tax cuts and reductions in regulations has been supporting economic growth and should support future growth if economic growth lasts 15 more months it will hit record territory in july 2019 when it would surpass the longest expansion on record at 121 months as was the case last year northern california especially the san francisco bay area and the pacific and mountain regions made a good showing in this year s report in fact 14 of the top 20 metros in the survey are in the pacific or mountain regions the top three are san jose sunnyvale santa clara san francisco redwood city south san francisco and oakland hayward berkeley these locations benefit from clusters of high tech and biotech companies and renowned institutions of higher education including ucsf stanford and uc berkeley that provide a steady stream of skilled workers and r d high technology and an educated workforce will always be key factors that differentiate the leading locations for firm expansion comments chmura the most profitable firms rely on a creative and productive workforce technology underpins a firm s ability to be more productive and education supports a worker s ability to perform at high levels showing a particularly upward swing is oakland hayward berkeley which rose from a 25th position in 2016 to 3rd in both 2017 and 2018 based on improved economic strength and workforce the location benefits from less expensive and more available real estate compared to san francisco and silicon valley locations other northern pacific locations made overall strong showings most noteworthy portland vancouver hillsboro or wa received its highest overall ranking 7th in the eight years of the survey helping the area is its tech boom and desirable lifestyle here both hardware and software sectors are growing strongly chmura adds many metro areas in the pacific northwest and mountain regions were hit harder than other areas around the nation during the great recession home prices for example were down significantly economic growth in these regions lagged the nation in the first few years after the recession as they worked through the imbalances in recent years there s been plenty of news about the skilled labor shortage the leading locations analysis shows that more attractive tax structures support employment growth in the first few years after taxes are lowered other factors such as quality of life and a strong public k 12 education system are important as well says chmura according to the report a number of cities are bucking the labor shortage trend and rising in their overall ranking among those showing significant upswings are philadelphia and salt lake city philly ranked an overall 47th in 2018 up from 141st in 2017 salt lake jumped to 12th this year from 32 in 2017 both cities attribute their improved marks to increasingly attracting educated workers it doesn t hurt that philadelphia is home to university of pennsylvania with its wharton school of business as well as drexel university and temple university stalwarts like columbus ind and san jose calif have consistently shown high rankings although the two places could not be more different from one another the point here is one does not have to be a tech haven or a large city to score well year after year what keeps the small midwest city of columbus ind among the top 10 msas year after year is its ability to attract an educated workforce the msa ranks fourth among the top metros for prime workforce also making columbus attractive has been its ability to revitalize the city through architectural excellence a task that began in the mid 20th century when the cummins foundation made it a mecca of modern architecture economic development efforts widespread beautification innovations various tax incentives and increased law enforcement have helped columbus overcome downward economies besides columbus other small cities that show noteworthy marks for their prime workforce include bend redmond ore auburn opelika ala and st george utah mid size metros scoring high for their prime workforce include olympia turnwater in washington state reno nev and gainesville fla while some locations are economically sound and offer many attributes those that show both year over year and longer term growth receive higher marks in this analysis in the past there have been numerous booming growth cities in the south and southwest e g austin texas and nashville tenn but in recent years overall rankings for these cities have slipped the nashville msa fell to 26th from the no 7 spot in 2017 and austin dropped from a 10th place ranking in 2015 to 46th in 2016 47th in 2017 and 50th for 2018 many locations fair well due to industry clusters that set up shop in regions around the country for example the south atlantic has over the years become a magnet for auto and advanced manufacturing particularly along the interstate 75 corridor this location has been beneficial to dalton ga best known as being home to the carpet and floor covering industry while ranked 196th overall as a leading metro location dalton made a particular strong no 3 showing for five year economic growth thanks to its innovation in cutting edge technology applied science global marketing and services these have led to new high tech products and patents year over year growth rankings indicate some surprises kankakee ill which ranked 54th overall ranked first in year over year growth kankakee county is regarded among the fastest growing metros in illinois and benefits from its geographic location 45 miles south of downtown chicago along the i 57 corridor in 2014 2016 the total capital investment in kankakee county exceeded 1 2 billion its website emphasizes ready access to the interstate rail all utilities fiber and workforce in a diverse business community including fortune and global 500 companies additionally two enterprise zones provide property tax abatement sales tax exemptions and other growth incentives needless to say creating a competitive position varies based on the type of firm that is expanding chmura says some manufacturing plants might need proximity to rail or a large water supply while software providers need good internet access metro size also did not determine whether or not a location showed economic strength or longer range economic growth small metros like elkhart goshen ind and napa calif took the first two spots in these categories with elkhart goshen ranked no 1 for economic strength and no 2 for five year economic growth while napa was no 1 for five year economic growth and no 2 for economic strength carson city nev also has experienced a remarkable trajectory once known for the comstock lode today carson city ranks third among the top 20 small metros and ninth overall in 2015 it ranked 308th overall in 2016 191st overall and in 2017 163rd overall part of the reason for its ascent is year over year growth robert hooper president and ceo of the northern nevada development authority attributes the region s growth to nevada s governor and state legislature putting in place the right formula for recovery and job creation during the great recession this allowed carson city to leverage its streamlined building process attractive tax structure and low cost fees economical industrial real estate and competitive utility rates for commercial operations to stabilize and grow its economy he says the city s geographic location easy access to the silver state s multi modal infrastructure and close proximity to major u s markets and deep sea ports also play a role in the growth of the area s advanced manufacturing logistics and construction industries in essence this is what is driving growth in many u s metros in today s economy area development s

will there be a u s and chinese trade deal yes but it will not be the deal which is to say there will not be a near term comprehensive multiyear agreement between the u s and china this will be bearish for the commodity sector in general but especially problematic for the u s grain markets resolving u s and chinese trade disputes will be a multiyear process or said differently an ongoing fiscal monetary and trade negotiation policy process why china has defined objectives and sees no reason to deviate from those objectives which are global economic technological financial and military supremacy china sees no reason why they should not replace the united states as the world s super power economically technologically financially and militarily market dynamics and outlook for the week beginning may 13 2019 interest rates 10 year u s treasury yield the trend remains sideways to down charts a1 to a4 the 10 year u s treasury yield or interest rate may 10 2019 was 2 47 and presently my contention is given time it has the potential to revisit the july 2016 low of 1 43 the november 2018 high was 3 24 that said we need to take these markets a week at a time my expectation this is a year for global governments and central banks to realign global currency bond equity and commodity markets which would have the potential to extend global economic momentum for possibly a few years thus global economic momentum going forward will likely have a slight downside bias at least into the fall of 2019 related managing costs crucial for crop success that said global economic stability will be maintained even as global governmental actions address global economic challenges across the globe with a couple of examples being the european union and chinese uncertainties this will produce periods of strength and weakness in global economic activity more importantly this will lay the foundation for stronger domestic and global growth in 2020 therefore 10 year treasury yields should remain sideways with a downside bias which is critically important for the u s economy and the collective global economies u s dollar index the u s dollar index simply remains in a slowly rising sideways to up trading pattern which will likely be sustained for a period charts a5 to a8 the dollar is currently at 97 12 on may 10 2019 consider the following about the u s dollar first president trump finds no humor in a rising u s dollar why a rising dollar will place a drag on u s domestic and global growth given today s global economic dynamics second a neutral to lower dollar

but hope remains march 29 2019 planting intentions will fall significantly short charts b18 to b20 cotton price weakness highly problematic cotton prices need to hold above 64 cents the week of may 13 2019 or serious price weakness could emerge may 10 2019 close 68 cents per pound charts b21 to b24 wheat price weakness remains wheat is displaying a downside trading range of 4 02 to 4 58 per bushel with a may 10 2019 close 4 25 per bushel we will adjust our estimates as market dynamics unfold charts b25 to b28 global equity etf acwi if support at 71 00 does not hold a further correction is

2018 at 60 92 emerging markets global emerging market performance near term will in part be a function of dollar strength and potential waning global economic momentum so be vigilant of weak price

from the prior quarter and an improvement of 43 over the same quarter last year compared to the first quarter of 2018 revenue growth was largely derived from the addition of our us mills and partially offset by lower shipments and unit sales realizations from our bc mills bioenergy segment revenues were generally consistent with the previous quarter and improved by 9 over the first quarter of 2018 we recorded operating losses of 13 5 million in the lumber segment in the first quarter of 2019 and 15 8 million in the previous quarter and operating earnings of 6 0 million in the first quarter of

quarter and deferred income tax expense of 0 7 million in the same quarter last year lumber segment continuing operations reduced operating rates at our bc and us mills our lumber segment operating results were hampered by lower operating rates which resulted in higher unit cash conversion costs at our fort st james bc mill the fsj mill and our el dorado and glenwood arkansas mills in the first quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we curtailed sawmill operations at the fsj mill for a total of approximately four weeks due primarily to market conditions reflecting lower lumber prices and elevated log costs exacerbated by the ongoing imposition of softwood lumber duties the lower operating rates at the fsj mill resulted in approximately 23 million board feet of reduced production in the fourth quarter of 2018 the previously announced temporary reduction of operating capacity at the fsj mill commenced on january 1 2019 with the reduced operating format expected to continue until about mid 2019 in addition sawmill operations at the fsj mill were temporarily curtailed for three weeks in february we expect the curtailments to result in an estimated 28 reduction in lumber production from our bc mills for the first six months of 2019 lumber production at our bc mills totalled approximately 74 million board feet during the first quarter of 2019 which represented an annualized operating rate of 54 compared to 69 in the previous quarter and 92 in the first quarter of 2018 our us mills produced southern yellow pine syp lumber at an annualized run rate of approximately 418 million board feet in the first quarter of 2019 and 380 million board feet in the fourth quarter of 2018 production levels in the first quarter of 2019 on an annualized basis represented approximately 89 of targeted levels for 2019 and 76 of two shift dimension lumber production capacity of 550 million board feet production at our us mills of approximately 105 million board feet represented growth of 10 over the previous quarter and contributed 60 of overall production overall operating results from our arkansas mills continue to be hampered by higher operating costs related to the additional costs and ramp up of second shifts which commenced in august 2018 without the attendant benefit of full two shift productivity we expect unit cash conversion costs to normalize in the second half of 2019 as operating rates approach targeted levels lumber segment operating results prices for the bell weather wspf 2x4 2 btr product averaged us 372 during the

first quarter of 2019 and represented a 2 decline from the previous quarter compared to the previous quarter a decline in shipment volumes of 5 outweighed an improvement in sales realization of 4 shipments from our bc mills declined by 21 and mirrored lower production levels resulting from the change in operating format and temporary curtailment at the fsj mill shipments from the us mills increased by 11 and reflected similar improvements in production volumes compared to the first quarter of 2018 revenue growth of 37 was primarily attributable to the addition of shipments from the us mills partially offset by 30 lower shipment volumes from our bc mills and a decline in sales realizations due to weaker lumber prices wholesale lumber revenues increased by 15 over the previous quarter and more than doubled compared to the same quarter last year unit log costs were relatively flat quarter over quarter and increased by 14 over the same quarter last year at our bc mills the higher log costs were mainly attributable to higher market based stumpage and purchased log costs unit log costs at our el dorado and cross city mills were generally consistent with the prior quarter we experienced higher unit log costs and periodic production disruptions at our glenwood mill due to extreme wet weather conditions which constrained log availability and heightened local competition for logs in the first quarter of 2019 and the previous quarter an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of 4 7 million over the first quarter of 2018 was largely attributable to our expanded operations in the us south we recorded a positive inventory valuation adjustment of 1 6 million in the first quarter of 2019 and inventory write downs of 1 4 million in the previous quarter

previous quarter and operating income of 6 0 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the previous quarter lumber segment operating results were hampered by lower overall lumber shipments and operating rates and higher unit operating costs at our bc mills which outweighed the benefits of improved sales realization and a positive quarter over quarter variance in inventory valuation adjustments compared to the first quarter of 2018 lumber segment operating results were challenged by lower operating rates and higher unit operating and log costs at our bc mills elevated operating costs at our arkansas mills due to the ongoing ramp up of production higher depreciation expense and lower sales realizations from our bc mills due to weaker lumber prices these factors were partially offset by overall revenue growth from increased lumber and residual shipments lower duty deposit expense and a positive inventory valuation adjustment lumber segment ebitda was negative 6 0 million in

liquidity of 11 1 million compared to 17 8 million at the end of 2018 the decreased level of liquidity over the recent past six months was due mostly to declines in lumber prices in the second half of the year duty deposits on us shipments escalating log costs at our bc mills and increased debt to fund the acquisition of our new u s mills we have taken a number of actions to reduce cash outflows at our bc mills increase cash inflows at our us mills and more actively manage debt and working capital levels we are also prioritizing operational enhancements and cost controls as our two arkansas mills ramp up two shift production to targeted operating rates we expect our us mills to provide additional reliable sources of cash flow as productivity and other operational improvements continue to progress throughout 2019 we are also reviewing other options to increase liquidity such as reducing discretionary capital expenditures and monetizing certain assets that are not central to our mid and long term development as a north american lumber producer subsequent to the end of our reporting quarter we enhanced our liquidity with the completion of the sale of lignum on april 1 2019 and utilized the proceeds of approximately us 11 5 million to partially repay a portion of the revolving credit facility our net debt to capitalization ratio was 49 at march 31 2019 compared to 47 at december 31 2018 net debt at march 31 2019 was 309 8 million compared to 307 0 million at december 31 2018 our net debt to capitalization ratio excluding borrowings for our power segment that are largely non recourse to our other operations was 43 at march 31 2019 compared to 42 at december 31 2018 outlook we continue to believe that current lumber prices do not properly reflect fundamental supply and demand factors that are expected to drive lumber pricing through the remainder of 2019 and 2020 regarding lumber supply the interior region of bc is the second largest source of softwood lumber supply to the north american market permitted sawtimber harvest levels in the region are in the process of being reduced to long term sustainable levels to adjust for the mountain pine beetle mpb epidemic in terms of lumber demand we expect lumber consumption will continue to grow over the next two years driven by a continuation of gradual increases in new residential construction and more substantial increases in repair and remodeling demand we expect the growth in lumber demand will outpace the growth in net new supply capacity utilization rates will remain elevated and lumber prices while remaining volatile will improve conference call we will hold a conference call on tuesday may 14 2019 at 8 00 am pacific time 11 00 am eastern time to discuss the first quarter financial and

one always have to be careful with trump s rhetoric he will always assert us superiority even if the facts clearly show that he is wrong china s biggest problem is in the it sector where it is reliant on us imports china s biggest challenge is what to do with all its usd denominated assets in the sense that it has effectively been bankrolling the us for the last few decades but now will find itself facing large barriers to entry in the us above all in terms of m a selling its us treasuries as opposed to stopping new investments in usts which it has already being doing for a few years on a net basis is not an option as it does as much if not more harm to china particularly as it has used usts as collateral for lending for instance on belt road projects ultimately this is a thucydides trap i e it s about which of the two countries will lead the world economy in its next major phase of economic development see this article from my colleague lauren judd sputnik white house economic adviser larry kudlow said earlier that american companies would pay for the tariffs on chinese imports as well as on chinese enterprises imposed by the trump administration trump has denied the claim who will eventually pay these tariffs china or us customers marc ostwald differentiated mostly us producers and consumers above all where there is no alternative producer sputnik the people s bank of china said on tuesday that it had decided to devalue the yuan s exchange rate in relation to the us dollar by 0 6 percent how will the market react marc ostwald that is not quite correct the pboc fixed the cny lower today a lot of pressure has emerged since monday last week and there is always a lot of chatter in these circumstances about china devaluing it is not really in their interest because a it creates inflation for china s consumers and b it creates problems for many em countries that china has lent to in usd and who will inevitable struggle to repay their debts read more us stocks dive by 617 points as china imposes new tit for tat tariffs i take the view that they will not pursue devaluation as a policy and that they will defend the 7 0 level vs the usd vigorously as they have done before sputnik the dow jones industrial index fell more than 600 points on monday one of its largest drops since early january how do you expect the situation to develop
china s yuan and the australian dollar regained some poise on tuesday after upbeat comments from u s president donald trump suggested trade talks with beijing could yet make headway the chinese currency sank to a 2019 low of 6 92 on monday in response to washington and beijing raising tariffs on the other s goods but the yuan managed to break a six day losing streak on tuesday and rose 0 25 as broader sentiment stabilised after trump said he expected sino u s trade negotiations to be successful china would be likely to intervene to stop any plunge through 7 against the dollar and could sell its vast holdings of treasuries as a negotiation tactic against the united states analysts are trying to gauge what the net effect of permanent u s tariffs on chinese imports would be on the dollar the only obvious impact on currencies is elevated risk aversion which tends to benefit conventional safe havens such as the swiss franc and the japanese yen trade wars do not benefit the dollar if you look at the yen dollar pair reacted to china announcing tariffs on u s goods it was clearly not positive for u s assets said viraj patel a currency strategist at arkera a financial technology firm the australian dollar managed to firm a tenth of a percent to 0 6952 after brushing its lowest since early january earlier in the session the aussie is often seen as a proxy for chinese growth because of australia s export reliant economy and china being the main destination for its commodities the euro rose 0 15 to 1 1238 the euro has been resilient despite the latest bout of trade tensions and it s probably down to people who were short euros vs emerging market currencies and are now buying euro back and unwinding euro hedges said stephen gallo european head of fx strategy at bmo capital markets in london investor focus on tuesday was also on euro zone industrial production for march and germany s zew economic sentiment index for may both due around 0900 gmt source reuters reporting by tom finn editing by peter graff
