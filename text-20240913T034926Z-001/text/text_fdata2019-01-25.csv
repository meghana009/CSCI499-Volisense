today the world is still dominated by the same elements that led to the crisis of almost a decade ago with the usa playing a key role this is where the speculative bubble burst in 2007 when so called sub prime securities were devalued by 60 to 100 these financial assets which had been shrewdly and prolifically distributed throughout the banks and speculative funds of the rest of the world ended up triggering the worst financial crash of the post war period we described then how the bursting of the speculative bubble created a financial crisis for the main american credit institutions and then cascaded down to engulf global financial markets we have also explained previously that the origin of this crisis is not in the financial sphere which is only an off shoot but in the real economy despite productivity increases upswings and downswings the profitability of investments in the us as in all the most advanced capitalist sectors has been declining for decades with profit rates steadily declining more and more capital is abandoning the real economy the one that produces goods and services and which creates new value through the exploitation of labour power in order to chase the mirage of easy profits offered by speculation an attempt in other words to somehow replace the profits capitalism lost in the productive sector with speculative gains this capital flight has only helped to depress real production and magnify a parasitic mechanism that began with the financialisation of the crisis itself this process involved the growth of fictitious capital or easy credit given the low cost of borrowing as a result the us economy was flooded by an ocean of debt from the state to companies and even families when the federal reserve increased interest rates the bubble burst with the global consequences we have all seen the explosion not only hit the financial apparatus the banks which had to be saved at any cost too big to fail it also impacted heavily on the fragile productive fabric which had originally generated it bringing lower wage rates and worse conditions of exploitation for the international proletariat today on the verge of 2019 the situation has not only not improved but has changed for the worse in italy official figures released by the current government speak of the end of the crisis and of a strong and long term recovery they claim that gdp will start to go up again to around a 2 5 increase per year unemployment will disappear whilst productive investment and profits will rise to if not surpass the period 2008 2017 nothing could be further from the truth meanwhile economic forecasts for the uk vary especially with the uncertain prospect of brexit but most commentators concur with the oecd s 2018 economic outlook that growth is projected to keep slowing as for the us growth where gdp is projected to reach 3 in the coming year has been announced to the whole world as an economic miracle however this forecast fails to mention either the enormous balance of payments deficit or the accompanying quagmire of a huge increase in public and private debt including companies and financial institutions overall the combined federal and individual states debt has reached a record of almost 390 of gdp us gdp is approx 20 66tn cwo note the only real success is that some sectors of production now have higher returns thanks to trump s reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 this tax reduction will be paid for by the state even using money from taxes paid by workers and employees and adding to the approximately 10tn that the state paid out in 2008 alone to save what is salvageable in the productive sector meanwhile the economist stiglitz reckons that the federal reserve has paid out 20tn to cushion the debts of banks and especially companies on the other hand the use of quantitative easing to staunch the financial haemorrhage means that a gift of over 12tn was given to the banks alone beyond stiglitz 20tn mentioned above the millions of jobs that trump waves like a flag as evidence of the alleged economic recovery have actually materialised in the shape of some hundreds of thousands of jobs but with ultra precarious contracts sometimes even for one week underpaid without any health or trade union coverage meanwhile the debt economy progressively expands to a worrying degree in one year from 2016 to 2017 the debt of non financial corporations companies grew by 11 1 the public debt increased by 6 7 household debt grew 12 5 and the financial sector debt grew by 11 3 the debt mountain the great recession of 2007 8 and the subsequent long depression which still continues have weakened the overall economic framework the global capitalist economy remains stagnant with a low rate of productivity growth trade flows are slowing down and above all the profitability of productive capital has not improved meanwhile cooperation has been replaced by increasingly cruel competition see trump s tariff policy according to world bank economists projections world economic growth is expected to fall to 2 9 by 2020 and therefore the long depression that began in 2008 not only has not ended but will continue with its dangerous toll of trade wars economic wars and increasingly violent and widespread wars of plunder in the usa the public debt that in 2007 was about 9tn 75 of gdp had reached 19 2tn by 2016 105 of gdp in recent years under trump this has only increased and in future it will be even worse with the acceleration of trump s policies it may already have reached 130 according to the treasury the budget deficit for 2018 has risen by 17 and is the highest since 2012 revenue increased by 0 4 while expenses exceeded 3 2 the congressional budget office projection for 2019 is that the budget deficit will reach a trillion dollars 1tn or one thousand billion trump s policies anticipate extraordinary outlays including 700bn for defence 31 tax cuts for businesses against it must be said an increase in private taxation of 6 1 in all the federal deficit will increase by an additional 214bn thanks to these tax cuts and increased military spending which will also increase the interest that has to be paid on the debt in the meantime the federal debt has skyrocketed to 22tn compared with about 18tn in revenue the budgets of more than half of the states in the united states have to be supported by the deficit policy of the us federal government in addition student debt has reached 1 5tn credit card debt equals 1 6tn 1 22tn for cars and 11 8tn of corporate debts on top of these there is a huge but unspecified amount of debt incurred through the purchase of real estate as well as another unspecified amount for the total debt of the individual states the most worrying figure however is company debt if it is true that in the first quarter of 2018 the top 500 us companies achieved a 26 increase in earnings per share it is also true that this was exclusively due to the enormous tax reduction proposed and implemented by the trump administration 30 if the profits of the entire corporate sector had been calculated without the tax cuts then in the first quarter of 2018 there would have been not a gain but a fall of 0 6 immediately preceded by an initial decline in the fourth quarter of 2017 of 0 1 with the tax reductions profits have increased by 6 meanwhile however profitability is low the average profitability of plants in america and the g7 economies remains well below pre crisis levels even after ten years of alleged recovery and despite the powerful capital injections of the federal reserve as well as the other central banks of the major industrialised countries the real obstacle to overcoming the crisis is the low rate of valorisation of capital the fear now is that the next crisis widely predicted by the same american analysts will occur from the explosive combination of manufacturing companies debt in the us as well as in all g7 economies and the overall mass of debts for example in 2017 the debt of us non financial companies reached a post crisis peak of 14 5tn equal to 72 of gdp in this sector i e companies producing goods and services the debt was 810bn higher than the previous year with 60 of the increase due to more debts contracted with banks and other financial institutions at present bond loans represent 43 of outstanding debt with an average maturity of 15 years compared to the previous maturity period of 2 1 years again for loans to american companies which implies that approximately 3 8tn will go to annual repayments for the loan contract there can only be so many avenues for repayment of loans in such an avalanche of debts even if interest rates are low at present in any case the overall picture that emerges is the following all companies both productive and speculative have significantly increased their use of financial leverage some companies have contracted debts not in order to invest productively but to finance repurchases of stocks bonds and government bonds creating a large cash flow and cash reserves in essence the lack of profitability of manufacturing and industrial companies has forced them not only to become progressively more indebted but to orientate themselves more towards speculation than towards production see the profits crisis behind the financialisation of the economy in prometeo 2 series vii november 2009 this is especially true for large companies while small and medium ones do not even have this option unless they are ready to run the big risk of going bust so they remain at the mercy of a market which is likely to eliminate them this is the same pattern of financialisation of the crisis which preceded the bursting of the sub prime bubble much of the debt is rated bbb bonds with the lowest investment grade this means they are just a hair above junk their fate is linked to even a minimum increase in interest rates which increases the cost of servicing the debt and therefore increases the costs of production the number of bbb rated companies has increased by 50 since 2009 and does not seem to stop the real situation of the american economy that has exited the crisis is to be found in government debt the federal deficit the balance of payments deficit and the debts of half of all the american states on top of all this public debt there is the pile of private and business debt this mountain of debt and deficits would make the us economy the most precarious in the world were it not for the hegemonic role of the dollar and the strength of its army ready to intervene in the four corners of the world whenever there is the slightest risk of interference with its strategic aims and financial interests but as roberts says in the long depression the big risk is the combination of declining profitability and increasingly high debt in the corporate sector not just the american but across the g7 if profits continue to slide while the cost of servicing debt increases with the rise in interest rates then this would be a dangerous recipe for a chain of corporate bankruptcies and a new devastating debt crisis global debt in particular corporate debt is at historic highs we would add that the fuse is lit so when is it going to explode even at the periphery of capitalism in the so called emerging countries the situation is replicated most manufacturing and financial companies in the emerging countries have heavily borrowed in dollars since interest rates on the dollar then before the crisis and now are relatively low the federal reserve bank has deliberately kept the interest rate on the greenback at almost nil much of the enormous flow of capital that has moved into emerging economies was not intended for productive investment but has been directed towards loans and bonds for speculative activities meanwhile long term capital flows towards emerging economies for productive investments fdis have been in rapid decline for at least a decade or since the beginning of the sub prime crisis the consequences are apparent every country affected by the financial crisis has raised interest rates on their government bonds this is the picture of the devaluations we have seen recently government bonds in turkey the interest rate that the state must pay to public sector underwriters has gone up from 12 to 20 in argentina from 6 to 26 2 in russia from 4 to 8 in indonesia from 3 to 9 in brazil from 10 to 267 in lebanon from 20 to 281 in south africa from 12 to 112 i e three out of five brics depreciation of the currency or loss of purchasing power argentina peso 46 turkey lira 45 south africa rand 22 brazil real 21 russia rouble 19 japan yen 5 5 it s like a movie we ve seen before a horror movie full of economic and social devastation when the god profit loses its supreme role in the production of surplus value it makes capital run away from productive investment towards speculation towards the creation of a massive amount of fictitious capital debt now governs the us economy all the fundamental data of the american economic system are in the red debt is suffocating productive activity including enterprises themselves threatening their survival on the domestic market and obliging them to mimic the large concentrations of speculative capital in the hope of surviving the decline in profit rates it is to protect companies such as these the ones overwhelmed by debt and devoid of profitable investment opportunities half of which have a bbb rating just above junk that trump s short term thinking brought him to raise tariffs against half the world in particular china he didn t stop to consider how china with its very low cost goods has so far allowed the over 80 million americans living below the poverty line to feed themselves nor did he take on board the inevitable reaction from those parts of the world which are now facing a wall of customs duties against their more competitive goods in reality as we ve already said by the way china is a fully emerged new power even if it has its own enormous budget problems china also has a huge public deficit apart from the trump sanctions china could potentially be the main trading partner of the us but it is adopting a completely different policy i e one oriented towards developing the new silk road and to creating a direct channel of communication and transfer of goods and capital to the west via the old eastern soviet republics and also via africa by land and by sea with the aim of reaching the mediterranean after getting commercial control of the greek port of piraeus this is a route where trade is no longer in dollars but in renminbi it is a clear act of war on the part of china not only against us tariff policy but as an attempt to make its own currency a serious competitor to the dollar on world markets in order to rake off a share in the foreign capital and surplus value that they contain should this happen there will be a new more sophisticated imperialist battleground but no less unsettling than any of the current rivalries friction with russia has also grown a point of contention is the possibility of trading natural gas and perhaps oil in roubles following the fierce struggle over the last few years in which russia and saudi arabia have been trying to knock out us shale oil which is much more expensive to produce than saudi oil the renewal of sanctions and the policy of duties against russia falls within the logic of defending american interests on at least three fundamental grounds 1 in the wake of russia s rescue of assad s regime in syria to prevent it having a permanent base in the mediterranean 2 detach europe from its energy dependence on moscow by building a series of pipelines to replace existing and planned russian ones 3 obstruct every opportunity for moscow to commercialise its siberian energy treasures by stepping up its trade in roubles given the threat of replacing the dollar that is coming from china and maduro s venezuela on top of these scenarios which are already so tense that they are on the edge of direct confrontation the us has imposed duties against iran and north korea against venezuela and canada and now threatens increased taxes on trade with germany and italy in the case of venezuela trump s trade policy has two objectives the first is to destabilise the maduro government which is already badly hit by the devastating economic crisis throughout the country at the same time as politically favouring and funding the right wing opposition the second as already mentioned consists in preventing maduro from selling oil with a new crypto currency the petro that would replace the dollar at least in the latin american region the us policy of imposing import duties dates back to august 1971 when america first experienced a trade deficit of 2 5m today it is 556bn the usa which had literally flooded the world with its goods after the second world war less than thirty years later found itself a net importer of goods and services the deficit itself was not high but it revealed the reduced competitiveness of american goods and signalled a dangerous turn round in relations with europe germany and japan the then president nixon was forced to take three historic measures in an attempt to save american companies from fierce foreign competition 1 increase taxes on imports by 12 2 simultaneously devalue the dollar by another 8 5 from 35 to 38 per ounce of gold thus in one fell swoop creating a 20 trade margin over the rest of the world and 3 declare the incontrovertibility of the dollar against gold in other words we are liberals so long as we dominate the commercial market when we lose this domination we impose taxes and duties on imports without any regard for the free trade treaties which we have previously always endorsed the same law goes for the dollar its 8 5 competitive devaluation temporarily increased us industry s survival margins and that was enough the announcement on de linking the dollar from gold had a twofold impact on the one hand the declining gold reserves in american coffers were unable to match the enormous mass of dollars circulating on the international market a mass that is constantly expanding on the other hand with the dollar devalued and released from the gold standard those who lost money were the speculators the savers and all the international banks which previously had invested in the dollar as a safe asset nevertheless successive us administrations have made sure they continue to make the dollar even if unhooked from gold the universal currency of world trade the refuge of last resort par excellence a commodity whose wholesale cost is close to zero a monetary instrument for all speculations and the means by which enormous flows of capital are channelled to the us economy but a strong dollar inevitably penalises the competitiveness of american goods by opening up a trade deficit chasm as the years go by still the various administrations have done everything to strengthen the dollar even while trying to offset the commercial damage the priority has been to keep the dollar s dominant position in the international money markets so that rivers of financial capital could be drawn into the american economy to finance the various deficits while what remained could be exported as capital to invest in countries where the cost of labour power was far below that of the american proletariat this key role for the dollar is so important that ever since the oil crises of the early seventies successive us administrations have not hesitated to engineer wars both to get their hands on energy raw materials and to ensure that oil and gas producers do not dare to deal with anything other than the dollar today so called oil or pipeline wars and the perennial issue of the supremacy of the dollar are still as significant as in the seventies only their geographical framework has changed and widened in intensity and ferocity the trump administration seems to be trying to square the circle i e to continue to have a strong dollar and a balance of payments which if not in positive territory at least is an acceptable deficit the policy of tariffs in addition to its political value of imperialist opposition with sworn enemies and commercial opponents is precisely a reflection of this have your cake and eat it policy i e a strong dollar and balance of payments which does not reflect the constant undercutting of what is produced in the states in short specific national tariffs and occasionally wars generated by economic crises beyond the fact that they destroy capital values which need to be rebuilt are capitalism s daily bread coupled with armed force they achieve the economic and strategic objectives which diplomacy and normal competition are unable to accomplish permanent war this is how wars which have never stopped since 1945 reflect the growing tension between the us and the other imperialist powers today competition is increasing on all fronts manufacturing and industrial commercial monetary and strategic and is turning into open military confrontation the motor force is still the economic financial crisis the crisis of profitability which brings lower returns on manufacturing investment generates more and more speculation this in its turn has generated an immense mound of financial liabilities which bring the additional danger that an increase in us interest rates will spark an irreparable debt crisis and provoke another much worse world crisis than the one which the optimists define as already a thing of the past a nominal and real rise in 10 year yields on us treasury securities 3 25 and 1 respectively over the highs of 2011 was enough to create ructions on new york financial markets on october 10 2018 the combined fears of a further increase in treasury yields and the risk of a trade war with china caused the dow jones to drop 832 points and the s p500 to lose 95 points 3 29 by the close of the day this was the worst fall since february 8th when the dow dropped over 1000 points this contraction of the markets and the sell off that hit securities in the technology sector nasdaq were also connected to the import duties imposed on china but the most powerful detonator was the fear that higher interest rates will magnify the indebtedness of entire productive sectors including technology ones securities of facebook twitter and netflix lost 20 of their value in an instant even trump has blamed what he called the mad fed policy of a third consecutive interest rate rise so far in 2018 all this is an undeniable sign of a permanent crisis for capital which appears on the surface in the shape of financial collapses and more fundamentally in the now endemic lack of returns in the world of the real economy it is the latter which is driving capital to flee investment in favour of the useless albeit riskier road of speculation here then is the only way capital can try to get out of the economic and financial crisis in the short term competitive devaluations speculation import duties more intense exploitation of the workforce dismantling of the welfare state in the long run however only a substantial destruction of capital values can resolve the crisis in the profitability of capital it is no accident that in the second world war it was the productive sectors which were most devastated afterwards this allowed us imperialism to invest productively in renewed infrastructures and reconstruction of european industrial plants located mainly in italy france germany and even japan moreover the us was able to export its surplus financial capital to key economic sectors of the defeated countries thus a huge opening was created for both the victors and defeated to begin a new cycle of accumulation but the end of the second world war did not bring an end to the fury of imperialism either american or russian in their different strategic ways they continued to confront each other not because the second world tragedy had not caused enough destruction but because in addition to destroying in order to rebuild imperialism needs to export capital to invest abroad to control and exploit territories with important raw materials and last but not least to exploit energy resources and manage their trade routes and get a share possibly in monopolistic terms of the revenues in the aftermath of the second world war a long series of proxy cold wars was to begin between the two victorious power houses of imperialism amongst them was the conflict in china in the period 1937 48 where a chinese communist party siding with the russians faced a pro american kuomintang the outcome after 1949 was that china was divided into two parts the continental one which fell under the influence of russia and the island of taiwan which came into the us orbit only a year later the conflict moved to korea 1950 53 the vietnam war followed 1962 75 and the bellicose events that bloodied central america in honduras and in nicaragua for and against the sandinistas as usual on one side was russian imperialism defending its new colonies on the other the us which used the services of the panamanian narco trafficker noriega to defeat the sandinistas the latter character who took tons of drugs from colombian cartels into the united states even returned loaded with arms supplied by the cia to be distributed to the contras in central america we could continue showing how the clash between the ussr and the usa defined the nationalist quarrel between israel and the palestinians the missile crisis in cuba the panama affair and us marines landing etc suffice it to say all of these represented conflicts in an endless war interrupted not by peaceful solutions but only when one of the contenders was obliged to abandon it then the ussr imploded an implosion which was the outcome of decreasing competitiveness of a disproportionate increase in investment in capital goods whilst labour productivity either declined or remained stagnant thus bringing a change in the organic composition of capital and an inexorable fall in profit rates despite their low productivity and profitability the huge investments in constant capital that were made largely benefited the powerful state oligarchy which derived its five year bribe from the financial allocations to industry and agriculture the more the state invested in constant capital even if it was not very productive the more the russian oligarchy had the chance to divert a portion of capital into their own pockets once again the us played its part in promoting the economic crisis of the soviet system by focussing on the competition between the two for military technological innovations and the arms race the ussr was forced to borrow heavily to pay for armaments ussr defence spending accounted for 23 of gdp against the 7 8 of its gdp that the us was spending this enormous disparity led to a disproportionate deficit in the coffers of the russian state which opened up the first breaches in the soviet state capitalist economic system a system already undermined by the scourge of a steadily falling rate of profit and growing weakness at the periphery of its empire it was the experience of solidarność in poland thanks in part to the cia and vatican that would annul the fleeting experience of a fake socialism that had come out of the defeat of the october revolution the first and only historical example of proletarian revolution to have occurred as yet the collapse of the ussr was effectively followed by 10 years of us mono imperialism which gave successive administrations free rein on the international scene it was the era of the first oil wars where the us extended its control over associated aspects of the industry such as the construction of pipe lines storage centres and refineries these obviously had to get into the hands of the american oil companies and other specialised companies linked to oil including engineering and logistic issues all of them participating in the exploitation of the oil revenue itself this was the period when american imperialism came out in the open in the 1990 91 war in iraq in afghanistan and then the second war in iraq in 2003 a whole decade was interspersed with minor but strategically important wars like those in the sahel in africa and the one that destroyed yugoslavia the last european bulwark of fake socialism in titoist guise meanwhile post soviet russia thanks to siberian oil and gas fields regained a position in the ranks of international imperialism and repositioned itself with china as a counterpart to the american superpower giving rise to a de facto second cold war at this point 2011 after the explosion of the arab spring the conflict moved to syria and libya in syria russia is supporting bashar el assad in order to defends its interests in the mediterranean with the maintenance of the military and commercial ports of tartus and latakia the alliance with assad s syrian armed forces provides russia a bulwark in the middle east against saudi arabia israel and their us imperialist mentor here there is already a generalised war taking place before our eyes a war orchestrated by all the most powerful imperialist centres in the area on the field we find russia and the us with their corresponding allies alongside russia is iran iraq and the lebanese hezbollah this is the shiite axis of the middle east lining up alongside the us are saudi arabia the emirates qatar which constitute the sunni axis loyal but not so much to trump s ambitions machinations are taking place inside libya where france italy the uk and the usa are all manoeuvring france and the uk backed by omnipresent us imperialism were behind the military expedition against gaddafi here the double aim was to take away eni s italian state oil company control of 40 of libyan oil france s goal and prevent gaddafi from selling its oil in euros roubles or yuan in syria we have seen the massive presence of all the major culprits for the carnage with their diverse often conflicting interests new alliances have been formed and old ones dissolved in a series of episodes that have brought the ruin of an entire country with two million dead and over four million refugees turkey russia iran and the shiite axis on one side the us israel and the sunni axis on the other each has its own interests to defend whilst in the middle the various kurdish nationalisms have become the military instrument of one imperialism and thus the target of attack for others even though they are part of the same coalition given the number of powers involved their areas of influence their active engagement in the war we can only conclude that we are already in the midst of a bizarre world war where apart from a few exceptions notably china the major imperialist antagonists are already colliding in one of the world s most important strategic zones it is no figment of the imagination to think that the next financial crash driven by increased interest rates will lead to an even worse economic situation worldwide and bring with it the danger of more generalised war through an intensification of current wars or the outbreak of new ones from a political perspective beyond the need to analyse what is going on in the world it must be firmly stated that the crisis is not an accident an inevitable natural disaster or some sort of divine curse it is the product of the existing mode of production of a global capitalism which is in a deep economic crisis from which it cannot escape which is generating a mountain of financial paper wealth 12 14 times the world gross domestic product which is fleeing from production to devote itself to the palliative of speculation because profit margins in the real economy are no longer sufficient for productive investments in short it is the fall in the rate of profit which accelerates capitalist competition and the clash between imperialisms in this context the tendency to war is not a warning but the concrete reality of all international relations and a state of affairs which involves all the main imperialist powers of the planet in various places in the world it is a situation that can only be resolved by going to the heart of the contradiction that underlies the entire capitalist edifice that is the relationship between capital and labour in no way can the problem be solved in terms of redistribution as the more or less radical reformists always suppose but only by building a position of strength in the struggle between classes and therefore of political leadership in the form of the class political party such a party will call for a break in the contradiction of capitalism itself in order to lay the political and economic foundations for the construction of a new society a society that is no longer based on the labour capital ratio not aimed at maximising profit without the wars that create destruction in order to rebuild without the existence of classes which presuppose the economic and political dominance of one over the other in other words a society of associated producers who work and build for collective needs where everyone contributes according to their particular skills and abilities otherwise it will still be barbarism destruction and death for millions of proletarians victims first of exploitation then of the war that must recreate the conditions for the production of profit itself there is no other solution either the world proletariat will succeed in escaping from the cages of nationalism from the thousand triggers for war that imperialism sets every day or a bursting of one of the many speculative bubbles possibly stemming from the federal reserve putting up interest rates will be enough to intensify and generalise the tragedy of existing wars and turn the world into a gigantic cemetery either war or revolution either war with its heavy burden of death destruction and barbarism or the revolution where the proletariat takes on the task of giving life to a new equitable communal and human social frame but for this to happen a strong international party is required to remove wage workers from the dominant thought of the ruling class stuffed as it is with provincialism nationalism racism as if these trappings of bourgeois ideology were in any case the pole star for the whole humanity it is vital to undermine and demolish the dominant ideology of the ruling class to begin to pose the question of a class to class frontal clash to present an alternative to this system which can only exploit produce crises devastate the eco system bring disastrous wars which only herald worse imperialist conflicts that will allow for the destruction of enough capital value to rebuild to create the conditions for a new cycle of accumulation this in turn would inevitably have the same problems as before but with an even greater capacity to destroy the world along with a proletariat unable to find the strength to prevent yet another barbarism for our part we are doing everything we can to stop this from ever happening the dualism of war or revolution is not an invention of the god mars or the rebellious prometheus in chains there is no historical course that necessarily leads to war or revolution the world will go towards war or revolution not because history is already written in the great book but only as the result of the balance of power between the ruling class and the subordinate class and this is not written anywhere except in the consciousness of those who work in one direction or another there are no historical courses leading to one side or the other the only valid yardstick is to evaluate the balance of power between the classes the economic underpinning that conditions their existence the ideologies which dominate them and the signals that come from one class or the other if we were to venture a hypothesis today on the basis of current elements we should say that the war solution is the most probable this is because in the current state of affairs the balance of power is on the side of the various imperialist bourgeoisies each of them attacks their proletariat by means of greater exploitation by punishing job contracts by increasing relative and absolute poverty they make and break the most absurd governments by supporting them or letting them fall according to their own contingent interests abroad that is outside of their economic market under the pressure of the crisis they set up theatres of war mostly fought by proletarians in the area under contention it does not matter whether the proletarians are kurds or arabs shiites or sunnis the important thing is that they are being dragged into the ideological mechanisms of this or that imperialism and that they act as cannon fodder for the sole benefit of the interests of the imperialism that has ideologically subjugated them as regards the proletariat the opposite is true they rarely oppose the economic attacks and the increasingly humiliating conditions of life that their respective bourgeoisies force upon them we live in a period when the crisis is so deep that the margins for successful demands which once characterised the daily struggle are narrowed today workers struggle not so much for a wage increase but for the most elementary social rights such as housing and better conditions of life and improved services when workers take to demonstrating in the streets they do so to defend themselves from the attacks of the bourgeoisie they do so to keep their jobs to stop their factory being displaced by some other service or from being moved abroad where another army of desperate people is ready to be exploited under worse conditions this is the picture the snapshot that makes us say that the current balance of power between the classes inclines us to consider the possibility of an even worse war in terms of intensity of destruction and the involvement of the international proletarian masses but things do not always go as the snapshot of the moment suggests over a longer time frame it is not the instant picture but an ongoing movie that could change the story in other words the balance of power between the classes can change during the course of events let us not forget the october revolution which had the strength to express itself in the middle of the first world war then too there was a world economic crisis the various european proletariats were under the banners of their respective imperialisms nationalism was raging worldwide yet the russian proletariat raised its head opposed the carnage of war fought for the revolution against the barbarism of imperialism behind and with its party its tactics and its communist strategy then came isolation from other revolutionary experiences in europe and the enormous economic retreat encouraged the forces of the counter revolution even within the bolshevik party itself so the revolutionaries do not simply have the task of analysing how things are going whether by a pre determined destiny or by a whim of the gods but of studying the economic and social situation as the capitalist crisis unfurled revolutionary communists have the task of creating the subjective conditions for the revolution not in opposition to the balance of power between the classes but in harmony with any sudden unexpected changes in those same power relations which could signal a change of direction amongst the subjective goals that revolutionaries must aim for is the building of the international communist party without which any change of course in the relationship between classes any resumption of the class struggle would end up with no day to day tactic or strategy for achieving an alternative to capitalism the proletariat would still be stuck ploughing the same tragic capitalist furrow that generator of all crises and wars here too the october revolution taught us a great lesson without the bolshevik party tens of millions of peasants and millions of workers would have turned away from any revolutionary solution and would have been re absorbed into the mystical nationalistic climate what followed is part of another aspect of history that we could call revolution and counter revolution today we are faced with war or revolution learning the lessons from the past which led to the victory of the russian proletariat and identifying the adverse conditions and consequent errors that accelerated its defeat fd november 2018

this week 2018 the year of shame for fundies byron wien s ten surprises for 2019 conviction calls join the csl challenge waiting for february pub beer pitt street research us earnings recession but how deep by rudi filapek vandyck editor fnarena byron wien s ten surprises for 2019 every year saxo bank draws up a list of potential surprises that might happen in the year ahead and when they do their impact will be significant if not devastating for investment strategies and portfolios but the chances of each of them happening are actually quite small a feature readily acknowledged by the analysts themselves the saxo bank list is usually widely published and re published including by fnarena there is an alternative which is likely to have a much larger impact on investment returns in the year ahead if only because events listed have a much higher chance of happening for the 34rd year in a row byron r wien vice chairman in the private wealth solutions group at blackstone released his top ten of probable surprises at the end of last year with each surprise given a higher than 50 chance to actually take place this year which make them a probable event investors might want to pay a little more attention to what byron wien has lined up for calendar 2019 byron s ten surprises for 2019 are as follows 1 the weakening world economy encourages the federal reserve to stop raising the federal funds rate during the year inflation remains subdued and the 10 year treasury yield stays below 3 5 the yield curve remains positive 2 partly because of no further rate increases by the federal reserve and more attractive valuations as a result of the market decline at the end of 2018 the s p 500 gains 15 for the year rallies and corrections occur but improved earnings enable equities to move higher in a reasonably benign interest rate environment 3 traditional drivers of gdp growth capital spending and housing make only modest gains in 2019 the expansion continues however because of consumer and government spending a recession before 2021 seems unlikely 4 the better tone in the financial markets discourages precious metal investors gold drops to us 1 000 as the equity markets in the united states and elsewhere improve 5 the profit outlook for emerging markets brightens and investor interest intensifies because the price earnings ratio is attractive compared to developed markets and historical levels continuous expansion of the middle class in the emerging markets provides the consumer buying thrust for earnings growth china leads and the shanghai composite rises 25 the brazil equity market also comes to life under the country s new conservative leadership 6 march 29 comes and goes and there is no brexit deal parliament fails to approve one and theresa may arguing that a change in leadership won t help the situation remains in office a second referendum is held and the u k votes to remain 7 the dollar stabilizes at year end 2018 levels and stays there throughout the year because of concern about the economy the federal reserve stops shrinking its balance sheet which is interpreted negatively by currency traders the flow of foreign capital into united states assets slows because of a softer monetary policy and a lack of need for new capital for business expansion 8 the mueller investigation results in indictments against members of the trump organization closest to the president but the evidence doesn t support any direct action against trump himself nevertheless an exodus of trump s most trusted advisors results in a crisis in confidence that the administration has the people and the process to accomplish important goals 9 congress however with a democratic majority gets more done than expected particularly on trade policy progress is made in preserving important parts of the affordable care act and immigration policy a federal infrastructure program to be implemented in 2020 is announced 10 growth stocks continue to provide leadership in the u s equity market technology and biotech do well as a result of continued strong earnings value stocks other than energy related businesses disappoint because of the slowing economy every year there are always a few surprises that do not make the ten because either wien does not think they are as relevant as those on the basic list or he is not comfortable with the idea that they are probable this year s less probable forecasts are 11 geopolitical tensions increase iran continues to destabilize the middle east and kim jong un fails to live up to his north korea denuclearization promises secretary of state pompeo and national security advisor bolton make statements indicating the united states may take pre emptive action in both places thereby causing one of several sharp market sell offs but in spite of hostile rhetoric the united states does not go to war with anyone as we approach the 2020 election trump s tough talk on some issues like trade works however and leads to successful diplomatic negotiations on national security 12 in desperation china engages in ambitious infrastructure programs to bolster its economy china grows at 6 5 real but the increased debt causes concern around the world and has a negative impact on the renminbi 13 china announces we want to be the world leaders in free trade it sends envoys around the globe to negotiate better bilateral trade terms in order to offset the losses from the ongoing u s disagreements joint ventures in which foreign companies control the majority share are initiated in all sectors from industrials and autos to raw materials as china s influence around the world becomes greater the u s further isolates itself 14 the european central bank is forced to restart quantitative easing in response to a defiant italy a weakening germany and brexit thwarting expectations that brexit would bring the rest of europe closer together italy realizes that it can break all fiscal rules without any fear of punishment from the e u as a result the italian economy falls into recession debt spreads surge and the ecb is forced to liquefy the system again for good measure the following were byron s ten surprises for 2018 1 china finally decides that a nuclear capability in the hands of an unpredictable leader on its border is not tolerable even though north korea is a communist buffer between itself and democratic south korea china cuts off all fuel and food shipments to north korea which agrees to suspend its nuclear development program but not give up its current weapons arsenal 2 populism tribalism and anarchy spread around the world in the united kingdom jeremy corbyn becomes the next prime minister in spite of repressive action by the spanish government catalonia remains turbulent despite the adverse economic consequences of the brexit vote the unintended positive consequence is that it brings continental europe closer together with more economic cooperation and faster growth 3 the dollar finally comes to life real growth exceeds 3 in the united states which coupled with the implementation of some components of the trump pro business agenda renews investor interest in owning dollar denominated assets and the euro drops to 1 10 and the yen to 120 against the dollar repatriation of foreign profits held abroad by u s companies helps 4 the u s economy has a better year than 2017 but speculation reaches an extreme and ultimately the s p 500 has a 10 correction the index drops toward 2300 partly because of higher interest rates but ends the year above 3000 since earnings continue to expand and economic growth heads toward 4 5 the price of west texas intermediate crude moves above us 80 bbl the price rises because of continued world growth and unexpected demand from developing markets together with disappointing hydraulic fracking production diminished inventories opec discipline and only modest production increases from russia nigeria venezuela iraq and iran 6 inflation becomes an issue of concern continued world gdp growth puts pressure on commodity prices tight labor markets in the industrialized countries create wage increases in the united states average hourly earnings gains approach 4 and the consumer price index pushes above 3 7 with higher inflation interest rates begin to rise the federal reserve increases short term rates four times in 2018 and the 10 year u s treasury yield moves toward 4 but the fed shrinks its balance sheet only modestly because of the potential impact on the financial markets high yield spreads widen causing concern in the equity market 8 both nafta and the iran agreement endure in spite of trump railing against them too many american jobs would be lost if nafta ended and our allies universally support continuing the iran agreement trump begins to think that not signing on to the trans pacific partnership was a mistake as he sees the rise of china s influence around the world he presses for more bilateral trade deals in asia 9 the republicans lose control of both the senate and the house of representatives in the november election voters feel disappointed that many promises made during trump s presidential campaign were not implemented in legislation and there is a growing negative reaction to his endless tweets the mid term election turns out to be a referendum on the trump presidency 10 xi jinping having broadened his authority at the 19th party congress in october focuses on china s credit problems and decides to limit business borrowing even if it means slowing the economy down and creating fewer jobs real gdp growth drops to 5 5 with only minor implications for world growth xi proclaims this move will ensure the sustainability of china s growth over the long term the following predictions were seen as less probable 11 investors recognize that the earnings of companies in europe the far east and the emerging markets are growing faster than those in the united states while the price earnings ratios in those regions are lower than those in america global investments become more broadly represented in institutional portfolios 12 the mueller investigation of the 2016 presidential election fails to implicate any members of the trump family in collusion with russian operatives 13 artificial intelligence gains visible momentum service sector jobs are automated particularly clerks in legal and finance professions as well as workers in fast food outlets and healthcare economists begin to question the unemployment data because the rate drops below 4 while so many people still appear to be out of work and seeking government assistance 14 cyber attacks become more prevalent and begin to affect consumer confidence a major money center bank suspends deposits or withdrawals for three days because its system is penetrated numerous retail organizations report that customer personal information has been obtained by hackers those invading corporate information systems appear to be smarter and more innovative than the internal employees protecting the computer data suggesting that the systems themselves need to be upgraded 15 the regulatory authorities in europe and the united states finally get concerned about the creative destruction of internet related businesses as a result of pressure from retailers and traditional media companies they begin an investigation of anti competitive practices at amazon facebook and google the public begins to think these companies have too much power 16 the risks in bitcoin are so great that regulatory authorities restrict trading among their concerns are no regulatory oversight no safety and soundness measures no recourse in the event of mistaken or miscalculated transactions high

reporting season one team already released the results of its own set of predictions but the news from jp morgan is not looking great the analysts see more potential for downside than upward surprises

observation earnings estimates are falling not only in australia but around the world which makes the upcoming reporting season in february doubly important as it should provide answers to questions such as have share prices fallen deeply enough not enough or way too far to more properly account for a more subdued outlook within this context i note indiscriminate selling has pushed down share prices for companies that can be linked to falling sales for new automotive vehicles both in australia and abroad as well as to discretionary consumer spending as such i believe investors have overlooked the resilience that should be embedded for companies such as bapcor bap arb corp arb and gud holdings gud carsales car might have a few niggles here and there in some of its marginal side

don t we just love a bear market rally or is it since the markets made a low on december 24 2018 the s p 500 has rallied some 13 6 percent the dow jones industrials dji is up 13 4 percent and the tsx composite has jumped 11 1 percent the broad based nyse is up 12 8 percent pretty impressive but to put it in perspective the s p 500 is still down 8 8 percent from its high close the dji is off 7 9 percent the tsx composite is down 7 6 percent and the nyse down 8 2 percent is the glass half full or half empty is the bear market over and the bull resuming or is this as we have claimed merely a bear market rally it is probably no surprise we are seeing a mix of analyst reports that are either calling this a bear market rally or saying that the bear correction is over and the market is resuming the bull market that started back in march 2009 in examining various indicators the story is definitely mixed and arguments could be made defending both the s p 500 made a lower low below the february 2018 low but the advance decline line did not confirm as it made a higher low the advance decline has taken out its 50 day ma and taken out the downtrend line from the highs a positive development the s p 500 has taken out its 50 day ma but is now just approaching the downtrend line from the highs normally in a bear market the advance decline line should be leading the way down note that on the nasdaq it was the opposite as both made lower lows with the nasdaq advance decline leading the way down thus confirming the drop in the market another measurement is the cboe equity put call ratio the weekly chart of the cboe options equity put call ratio shows the ratio is still in hallelujah territory as the market has rallied 10 percent but remains off its highs that suggests to us that we should be cautious now as the market has quickly turned bullish from bearish note at the recent low the market was quite bearish in oh woe is us territory at 0 525 the ratio is at levels seen at the highs back in january 2018 the spike in the put call ratio into bearish territory was seen on december 17 2018 at 1 13 so we have an advance decline line giving off bullish signals and a put call ratio suggesting the market has gotten too bullish too fast has the market gotten ahead of itself and is now more bullish than it was at the top back in january the number of stocks trading above their 200 day ma on the s p 500 is still only at 35 percent up from the low of 10 8 but well off the high seen in late september 2018 at 73 2 another measurement we look at is the nyse mcclellan summation index ratio adjusted rasi the rasi is kind of a companion piece to the mcclellan oscillator a market breadth indicator that evaluates the balance between advancing stocks and declining stocks the summation index is a long term version of the mcclellan oscillator on the week of january 7 2019 the mcclellan oscillator soared to 117 6 that was a level higher than anything seen over the past 10 years including many ongoing all time highs that were made particularly during 2017 and to the major top in january 2018 it is even more interesting because on the week of january 5 2009 during what was another bear market rally the mcclellan oscillator hit 121 9 by march 2009 the markets hit new lows the rasi is nowhere near bullish territory yes it has rebounded off its bearish lows but it is still in negative territory the divergence with the mcclellan oscillator suggests to us this is no more than a bear market rally and the markets could once they turn down again hit new lows bear markets are tricky creatures bear market rallies are designed to bring as many back into the market as possible both the bear markets of 2000 2002 and 2007 2009 saw numerous rebounds following a sharp drop the most famous bear of all 1929 1932 initially saw the s p 500 plunge 28 9 percent from september to december 1929 that was followed by a rally of 16 1 percent into april 1930 the market then fell another 75 percent into july 1932 with only shallow recoveries along the way but that was a pretty straight down affair into the depths of the great depression both the 2000 2002 high tech dot com bear and the 2007 2009 financial crisis bear were much choppier as the charts below attest following the major top in the s p 500 in march 2000 until the final low in october 2002 there were nine drops ranging from ones of 33 9 percent to 6 7 percent bear market rallies ranged from 26 4 percent to 8 2 percent the march 2000 high was never taken out on any of the subsequent rallies the biggest drop occurred near the end from march 2002 to july 2002 the black swan event was september 11 2001 aka 9 11 similarly the bear market from october 2007 to the final low in march 2009 saw seven significant declines followed by six rallies the declines ranged from as much 36 1 percent to 10 8 percent while the rallies ranged from 8 3 percent to 27 3 percent the biggest drop was from august 2008 to october 2008 centered around the black swan event of the lehman brothers collapse the biggest rally was from november 2008 to january 2009 when the market gained 27 3 percent and everyone thought the bear was over well not quite as the market collapsed another 29 3 percent into the final low in march 2009 the bear market that got underway in october 2018 is quite young it is so far only four months old we have not had any major drop except for the 16 2 percent decline into december 2018 so far the rally looks impressive but it has crawled back to just above the 50 day ma a level often tested in bear market rallies indicators are mixed with some appearing bullish and others still bearish so as we asked at the outset are we in a bear market rally or are we returning to the bull market of 2009 2018 after nine years and only two relatively shallow corrections the negatives are piling up right now the market is all excited that the u s and china will somehow resolve their trade differences china has even conceded some points and will buy more u s exports but as we have seen with trump in the past the goalposts can suddenly be moved again then there is the debt slowing economies in the eu japan and china the shutdown in the u s that is dragging on with seemingly no solution and a mueller investigation that could still blow up given the most recent revelation of former trump lawyer mickey cohen apparently being paid to rig web polls for trump assuming it is not fake news as is being claimed the potential for a dragged out impeachment remains military tensions continue between the u s and russia and the u s and china that are most likely not going to go away the eu is also in crisis with the u k wrapped up in the brexit france under siege from the yellow vests and numerous anti eu governments in power led by germany there are signs the eu could be sliding into recession then again there is the debt 250 trillion the real elephant in the room that no one wants to talk about but as the global economy slows debt collapses usually follow bear market rallies are designed to drag everyone back in believing the worst is over given the sub par volume seen since december we remain convinced this is no more than a bear market rally for traders bear market rallies present opportunities for investors not so much as we noted earlier markets were universally down in 2018 the likelihood is that few investors made money the rally into january has everyone optimistic again it is at the high point of optimism that the bear suddenly bares his claws once again we ve had no pullback along the way if we are truly returning to the bull then we need to see the nature of a pullback that will give us a better clue as to how this might play out markets and trends in the past week stock markets around the world have continued their big run up since december the dow jones industrials dji gained just under 3 percent the s p 500 was up 2 9 percent the dow jones transportations djt leaped 4 percent and is now up 9 2 percent in 2019 while the nasdaq was up 2 7 percent the small cap russell 2000 gained 2 4 percent elsewhere the tsx composite was up 2 4 percent while the tsx venture exchange cdnx was one of the few losers off 1 percent internationally the msci world index gained 1 2 percent the london ftse 100 was up 0 9 percent the paris cac 40 jumped 2 percent while the german dax gained 2 9 percent in asia china s shanghai index ssec was up 1 7 percent and the tokyo nikkei dow tkn gained 1 5 percent despite the impressive gains this month and from the december lows these markets remain down on the year the really big winners were elsewhere we note that the ukraine stock market pfts gained 67 percent in the past year while the venezuelan stock market ibvc was up even more at 155 percent while the zimbabwe stock market also jumped 67 percent on a more practical note brazil s bovespa gained 17 percent markets at least love their new right wing government elsewhere almost everyone was down on the year our attention is drawn to the sharp rally that has taken place since the low on december 24 2018 it all started with the 1000 point plus up day on boxing day december 26 2018 not long after the bear market of 2018 was declared dead grant you things were pretty oversold in december with numerous readings on the rsi well under 30 and even under 20 the market has now been up four weeks in a row but the wave structure is highly suspect markets do not go straight up as we have seen in the past month while it was a much shorter wave note the run up that occurred in october that saw the dji gain 9 percent quickly a few weeks later there was another quick run up that saw the dji gain a more modest 7 percent this run has added 13 5 percent in a hurry as we saw with the previous two quick run ups they soon ran out steam and fell on their own volition in almost the same manner they went which was straight up they were quickly followed by a straight down move we expect this too could quickly reverse and run to the downside straight up moves like this are not sustainable nor are they normal for a bull market bull markets usually plod to the upside not zoom to the upside yes the market was oversold but it is not unusual for the market to retest its lows and either make new lows 2009 or higher lows 2003 the structure also appears as an abc type move which suggests this is corrective only and not a new impulse wave to the upside we noted in our essay that the cboe put call ratio quickly reverted from heavy on the put side to heavy on the call side the market is quickly betting on higher prices they are likely to be disappointed our long term monthly chart of the s p 500 shows that the s p 500 firmly broke under the uptrend line from the february 2016 low but thus far has held the uptrend from the 2009 low in that respect declaring that the bull market is dead is yes probably premature it s not quite dead yet but it is damaged goods the s p 500 is currently testing the 21 month ma but remains under the 10 month ma generally it held the 34 month exponential ma as was seen in the 2000 2002 bear and the 2007 2009 bear the real bear did not get underway until the market closed under the 34 month exponential ma that doesn t mean we are suddenly going to resume the 9 year uptrend considerable damage has been done and it will take more than an impressive run up from the december low to suggest this is over we have noted on our trends that the monthly long term trend remains up even as it has been weakened considerably the intermediate weekly trend remains down despite the sharp run up in the past month only the short term trend daily turned up this past month if the s p 500 can regain above 2 750 then there is an outside chance of a run to new highs but since the market will be more of a trading market than a consistent investing market going forward a better trading buy could occur once the market retests its lows here is an interesting chart of record highs and sell offs from those highs over the past several years since the low of march 2009 most drops fell only into one what the market defines as correction territory a drop of 10 percent or more but none fell officially into what one refers to as a bear market a drop of 20 percent or more the most recent was the closest at 19 8 percent another note is that in 2018 the s p 500 spent 27 days in correction territory in 2017 there were no days in correction territory nor were there any in 2013 or 2014 and only five in 2015 because of the gyrations in the market in early 2016 that year saw 20 days in correction territory here is a chart of the nyse new highs new lows index note those huge plunges in 2015 2016 and more recently in 2018 note the plunge in early 2018 that was followed by a return for the index above zero however unlike the early period from 2016 to 2018 it was a pretty feeble bull the current run up has taken the index to just above zero what that tells us is despite the strong rally since december 26 the market has produced balanced new highs and new lows this is not a strong up move nearly all the stocks in the indices remain well off their all time highs the michigan consumer sentiment indicator took an unexpected dip this past month the january index came in at 90 7 except the market was expecting a reading of 97 are consumers losing their mojo given the importance of the consumer to the economy any dip in this index could spell trouble for the economy down the road consumer confidence is at its lowest level since trump was elected cited as reasons for the drop were the government shutdown the trade wars and the impact of tariffs the instability in the stock markets signs of a global slowdown and confusion over monetary policy particularly with trump s sniping at fed chairman jerome powell despite the drop the indicator is not yet at levels that might suggest the start of a sustained downturn in the economy it is probably no surprise that margin debt has declined from the lofty levels seen only a few months ago the latest numbers show that margin debt has fallen 6 5 percent in the past month this coincides with the drop in the stock market the data above only goes to the end of december 2018 but note that negative credit balances while they have improved still remain at astronomically high levels we are a long way from the positive credit balances that were last seen in 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis complacency reached such high levels that we soared to record margin debt that exceeded anything seen before including the bursting of the tech bubble and the bursting of the housing bubble the latest quarterly gdp numbers for germany saw the german economy contract by 0 2 percent in q3 we await the q4 numbers they are not expected to be particularly good if they are negative again germany will have officially entered a recession defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth germany isn t the only eu economy suffering negative growth in q3 joining them were austria italy sweden and switzerland not exactly the names one would expect no greece spain portugal or ireland or any of the eastern european countries who are a part of the euro zone china s gdp growth has been on a downward trajectory now for years it is now at its lowest since the 2008 financial crisis once again the chinese are resorting to pump priming by pumping liquidity into the financial system a reminder that japan has been doing that years and the result is japanese gdp is negative again in q3 china s shanghai index ssec was one of the worst performing major indices in 2018 falling 24 6 percent as with everywhere else it has jumped since the end of the year however it is once again running into resistance at the major downtrend line the last low in december was barely below the low seen in october so there is a chance the index could break out to the upside this is in keeping with the thought that some of the emerging market indices may be due for at least a corrective move to the upside it is possible that the ssec has completed a 5 wave decline from the highs seen in early 2018 a move over 2 650 would suggest further moves to the upside and a corrective wave underway major resistance is up at 2 800 the tsx composite like the other north american indices has enjoyed a sharp run up from the december lows the tsx is up 11 percent from those december lows however it is now running into resistance zones that stretch from 15 300 to 15 700 we believe the tsx would have to regain above 16 200 to suggest a run to new highs otherwise as noted earlier this up move is too fast and is not sustainable and is most likely due to fall at any time note the low volume on the upswing that is typical of bear market rallies here is a long term view of the tsx composite using a monthly chart there are two arguments here one bullish one bearish this is either an ascending triangle bullish or an ascending wedge triangle bearish this appears more to us as an ascending wedge triangle bearish normally in an ascending triangle the top line is either flat or slightly declining an ascending triangle has rising lows in an ascending wedge triangle the top line is rising meaning it is a series of higher highs the bottom line also rises in a series of higher lows but the line is usually steeper then that seen on an ascending triangle or a symmetrical triangle for that matter the triangle above has rising highs and sharply rising lows we believe it is an ascending wedge triangle that is ultimately bearish naturally a breakout above 17 000 would kill any thought of an ascending wedge triangle but a breakdown under 14 000 and new lows would confirm the thoughts of an ascending wedge an ascending wedge triangle usually returns to where it started and that is the 2009 lows of 7469 on the monthly chart the triangle still has more than a few months to play out within the context of the ascending wedge triangle it could even wiggle its way back to the top of the triangle which currently would mean small new highs as the stock market improved it is probably not a surprise that investors read funds came out of bonds and ran into the stock market the result is the yield on the u s 10 year treasury note has leaped from a low of 2 56 percent in december to 2 79 percent this past week this is the first significant correction since the top back in october 2018 at 3 24 percent it is possible that the backup in interest rates could reach to 2 90 percent to 3 00 percent before it resumes its downtrend above 3 00 percent would suggest that the bond bear is back the fomc meets at the end of the month january 29 and 30 and the wide expectation is that they will leave rates unchanged what we will have to watch for is hints that they are softening their interest rate hiking stance recent comments suggest that they are indeed softening their stance towards hikes the gyrations in the stock market are a catalyst because they usually precede a recession recession watch spread speaking of recession our recession watch spread remains largely unchanged this past week despite a back up in rates for the 10 year treasury note the 2 year treasury note backed up equally keeping the 2 10 spread up only 1 bp in the past week to 17 bp while the trend remains down we are nowhere near negative spreads just yet a prolonged period of negative spreads normally precedes a recession canada s 2 10 spread is narrower at 8 bp but it too remains positive even as it is weakening this is a great chart to illustrate the impact of the fed s operations on the stock market qe1 qe2 operation twist and q3 all resulted in the stock market making significant moves to the upside when each one ended the market also hesitated the only one that was really different was the last major upswing in the stock market from 2016 to 2018 no qe and the fed hiking interest rates should have as many would believe resulted in a stock market drop that didn t happen the stock market kept climbing on the belief that trump would bring in huge tax cuts and allow corporations to repatriate funds from overseas he delivered it set off a wave of speculation it was also a period that saw borrowings leap and stock buybacks become prevalent then the proverbial stuff hit the fan with the start of the trade wars in early 2018 and the party faltered bitcoin continued its trend of the past year this past week meaning it was down losing 1 0 percent bitcoin is now down 4 4 percent on the year bitcoin s volatility has fallen sharply in the past year down apparently some 98 percent that is reflected in the narrowing range and quieter trading we continue to believe that bitcoin and the cryptos have further to fall there is support in this bear channel down to around 3 000 a breakdown under that level would spell bigger trouble for bitcoin and by extension the cryptos bitcoin has had trouble getting above 4 000 suggesting there is good resistance at that level judging from things we read about cryptos all the bullishness is still not been removed a final bottom would come when bitcoin and the cryptos barely get a mention anywhere and no one has any further interest but blockchain will survive as to the cryptos well probably not so much the us index found support down near the 200 day ma at 94 62 low was 94 64 and has since rebounded as the market has been buoyed by the thought that the u s and china might resolve their trade differences but one has to consider the two partners the u s trump and china neither are known for actually abiding by what they say the current rebound might have a bit more to the upside the 50 day ma is up at 96 35 that might be an appropriate point to test once the market turns down again we should be able to test at least the major trendline support near 94 if the us index breaks down under 94 then potential targets become 89 30 the us index has been exhibiting strength primarily because of weakness in the euro the euro fell 0 9 percent this past week and is now down 0 8 percent in 2019 in response to what is going on with brexit and the possibility that the german economy may slide into a recession it is one thing when the euro zone reports weak results in eastern europe or greece spain portugal or even italy but if germany starts to slide then it spells trouble for the entire euro zone japan has been benefitting as a safe haven away from the u s and the euro zone but even it slid this past week losing 1 1 percent as some japanese money ran back into the u s stock markets we expect this rally in the u s dollar should soon run out of steam and it will resume its downward trend support is seen at 95 50 95 and 94 60 theresa may survived her confidence vote but her brexit plan bombed and was soundly defeated this leaves the united kingdom scrambling either to find a replacement deal to offer the eu who could reject it or to face a messy no deal exit on march 29 or they may try and extend the deadline nonetheless the british pound appears to be making either a bottom pattern bullish or is forming a descending triangle bearish it would have been better if that december low was a higher low to the august low the pound needs to break out over 134 to suggest a potential move to around 140 142 otherwise the bottom could fall out of the pound under 125 with potential targets down to 115 117 the brexit has not gone well if another referendum were held the remainers would most likely win planning a separation based on a bare majority of 51 9 percent was never a good idea in the first place it was essentially a split vote very divided at the minimum it should have required a 60 percent threshold but we admit we are stating an opinion we continue to find the bottoming pattern on gold formed from roughly june through november 2018 the bottom pattern which appears as a potential double bottom has potential targets up to around 1 340 significant resistance is seen at 1 300 to 1 310 and the first attempt at overhauling that zone failed nonetheless the consolidation under 1 300 appears orderly and we shouldn t see any major pullback there appears to be good support down to around 1 250 gold in us has been pressured lower because of strength in the u s dollar strength in the u s dollar and weak gold in us translates into strength in other currencies it seems that gold as measured in 72 currencies is at or near all time highs grant you many of the currencies are in third world countries but some significant ones show up on the list such as the turkish lira and the russian ruble surprisingly the canadian dollar was on the list note that the cdn has fallen 3 6 percent since october 1 2018 while gold in cdn is up 18 6 percent vs gold s rise in us up only 9 8 percent in the same time frame gold in cdn is only about 200 off its all time high while gold in us is off by about 640 it is also noteworthy that the last time gold in lesser currencies was creeping higher and higher 2001 2011 it preceded a strong bull market for gold in us the government shutdown in the u s still leaves us without any cot report as the cftc is one of the impacted agencies the current consolidation might have more time to run but once gold takes out 1 300 a run to 1 340 1 350 should get underway the current environment of dysfunctional governments and weakening economics should help propel gold upward silver prices pulled back this week falling 1 7 percent silver is now down on the year by 0 9 percent as with gold a stronger u s dollar helped to push precious metals prices lower so far silver has found support around the 200 day ma but there remains good support down to 15 20 below that level silver could fall to 15 we note this looks like a small fourth wave correction with a fifth wave to the upside to come that should take silver over 16 there should be congestion resistance in the 16 10 16 20 zone but above that level a push towards 16 50 should get underway below 15 20 significant support comes in at around 14 60 to 14 90 we expect silver should not get that low it was not a particularly good week for the gold stocks the gold bugs index hui fell 5 4 percent while the tsx gold index tgd chart above was off 3 9 percent the tgd fell just short of our target of 190 with a high of 187 58 we have now established a line of resistance at 188 there could be some further consolidation to come with the tgd and a test of the uptrend line currently near 160 cannot be ruled out it is also the 100 day ma the 50 day ma has crossed over the 100 day ma but remains below the 200 day ma the 200 day ma is currently at 176 sentiment towards the gold stocks remains somewhat bearish with the gold miners bullish percent index bpgdm at a pretty neutral 37 only above 75 does that index begin to cross into strong bullish territory bear territory is under 25 there is some support here at 172 but under 170 a drop to 160 would not surprise us resistance is now at 176 180 and 188 a firm breakout over 188 could suggest a move for the tgd up to around 205 to 210 we expect support down to 160 will hold and this pullback is a buying opportunity strong seasonals prevail for the gold sector until late february early march oil prices continued their recent surge this past week thanks to the saudis cutting production more than expected in december opec production fell by 600 kb d and saudi arabia was the leader in the cutbacks all of this has helped propel wti oil from about 42 to 54 over the past few weeks it has also helped put a bid into the beleaguered energy stocks as both the philadelphia oil gas index xoi and the tsx energy index ten enjoyed a bump of 2 4 percent and 2 7 percent this past week since the lows in december the xoi is up 18 5 percent and the ten is up 20 percent after being terrible performers in 2018 the new year is off to a bumper start grant you oil and the energy stocks strong seasonals are december to july right on cue it seems the potential easing of trade tensions between china and the u s also helps as it might help bolster demand otherwise most of the other factors that govern oil prices such as geopolitical unrest and currencies have been relatively flat of late it is possible that this up move like the stock market is too much too fast and both wti oil and the energy stocks pull back to test their recent lows so far it is looking like a v bottom nonetheless a short term top and a pullback would not particularly surprise us right now wti oil has support down to 52 and then to 50 below 50 oil prices could tumble again although we doubt it there is resistance here but if wti oil can push higher over 55 then it could soon be at 58 to 60 chart of the week a picture of how quantitative easing qe turned into quantitative tightening qt after the collapse of lehman brothers in september 2008 an event that almost brought down the entire financial system the fed along with the other major central banks boj boe bofc ecb snb and pboc embarked on an historic period of ultra low interest rates down to zero and even below they injected huge amounts of liquidity in the financial system to bail it out and prevent a mega collapse that could have possibly led to another great depression it was an experiment of epic proportions it was also an extremely risky experiment the fed injected over 4 trillion into the financial system by buying back securities from the banking system including u s treasuries and mortgage backed securities mbs and other highly leveraged financial instruments the result saw the fed s balance sheet explode from around 800 billion to over 4 trillion the u s along with the eu japan china and others also saw government debt explode the ultra low interest rates encouraged borrowing on an unprecedented scale for both the corporate and consumer sector they also created bubbles in almost everything housing stocks and more but oddly not commodities or gold although they enjoyed a powerful run from 2009 to 2011 it was even nicknamed the everything bubble following the dot com bubble of the 1990s and the housing sub prime mortgage bubble of the early to mid 2000s qt began back in 2015 with the fed hiking interest rates and its balance sheet began to flatline and descend as they stopped pumping liquidity into the financial system after initially faltering the stock market started rising again with the election of trump and the speculation of massive tax cuts the tax cuts came eventually and that helped push the market even higher with the onset of qt in 2017 the stock market wavered and eventually cracked in 2018 sparked by the fear of trade wars and the tax cuts wearing off the fed is now back tracking a bit as they are hinting that they might think twice about hiking interest rates further the almost 20 percent drop in the markets spooked them a bit and as well trump s constant complaining about fed policy and fed chairman jerome powell didn t help nonetheless the fed has not halted their qt of selling off their holdings however if things went down again would they switch back to qe not likely as long as the economy doesn t show signs of faltering the fed is probably still in line for an interest rate hike once again in march they tend to start too late and end too late disclaimer david chapman is not a registered advisory service and

24 01 2019 will the euro survive michael roberts looks back at the last 20 years and predicts a rocky future january 1 was the 20th anniversary of the launch of the euro and the single currency area of the euro zone it began with 11 member states but two decades after its birth membership has grown to 19 countries and the euro area economy has swelled by 72 to 11 2 trillion 12 8 trillion second only to that of the us and positioning the european union as a global force to be reckoned with the euro is now used daily by some 343 million people in europe and a number of other territories also use it as their currency and another 240 million people worldwide as of 2018 use currencies pegged to the euro which is the second largest reserve currency as well as the second most traded currency in the world after the dollar as of august 2018 with more than 1 2 trillion in circulation the euro has one of the highest combined values of banknotes and coins in circulation having surpassed the us dollar that is one measure of success but it is not the most important benchmark considered by its founders the great european project that started after world war ii had two aims first it was to ensure that there were never any more wars between european states and second to make europe an economic and political entity that could rival america and japan in terms of global capital this project to be led by franco german capital went further and aimed at integrating all european capitalist economies within a single market to compete with the us and asia and with a rival currency to the dollar common currency let us first examine whether the euro has been a success for capital in the participating states and whether it has been good news for labour before considering whether it will still be here after another 20 years how do we measure the success of a single currency area in economic terms mainstream economic theory starts with the concept of an optimal currency area oca and the essence of oca theory is that trade integration and a common currency will gradually lead to the convergence of gdp per head and labour productivity among participants the oca says it makes sense for national economies to share a common monetary policy if they 1 have similarly timed business cycles and or 2 have in place economic shock absorbers such as fiscal transfers labour mobility and flexible prices to adapt to any excessive fluctuations in the cycle if 1 is the case then a one size fits all monetary policy is possible if 2 holds then a national economy can be on a different business cycle with the rest of the currency union and still do well inside it equilibrium can be established if there is wage flexibility labour mobility and automatic fiscal transfers the european union has shown a degree of convergence common trade rules and the free movement of labour and capital between eu countries has led to convergence when it comes to productivity it has been as strong as in the fully federal us although convergence more or less stopped in the 1990s once the single currency union started to be implemented so the move to a common market customs union and eventually the political and economic structures of the eu has been a relative success the eu 12 then 15 from the 1980s to 1999 managed to achieve a degree of harmonisation and convergence with the weaker capitalist economies growing faster than the stronger but that was only up to the start of the economic and monetary union emu in the 1992 the evidence for convergence since then has been much less convincing on the contrary the experience of emu has been that of divergence the idea that free trade is beneficial to all countries and to all classes is a sacred tenet of mainstream economics but it is a fallacious proposition based on the theory of comparative advantage that if each country concentrated on producing goods or services where it has a comparative advantage over others then all would benefit trading between countries would balance and wages and employment would be maximised but this is empirically untrue countries run huge trade deficits and surpluses for long periods they have recurring currency crises and workers lose jobs from competition from abroad without necessarily getting new ones from more competitive sectors the marxist theory of international trade is based on the law of value in the euro zone germany has a higher organic composition of capital occ than italy because it is technologically more advanced thus in any trade between the two value will be transferred from italy to germany italy could compensate for this by increasing the scale of its production export to germany to run a trade surplus this is what china does but italy is not large enough to do this so it transfers value to germany and it still runs a deficit on total trade with germany in this situation germany gains within the euro zone at the expense of italy no other member state can scale up their production to surpass germany so unequal exchange is compounded across the emu on top of this germany runs a trade surplus with other states outside the emu which it can use to invest more capital abroad into the emu deficit countries the marxist theory of a currency union thus starts from the opposite position to that of neoclassical mainstream oca theory capitalism is an economic system that combines labour and capital but unevenly the centripetal forces of combined accumulation and trade are often more than countered by the centrifugal forces of development and unequal flows of value there is no tendency to equilibrium in trade and production cycles under capitalism so fiscal wage or price adjustments will not restore equilibrium and anyway may have to be so huge as to be socially impossible without breaking up the currency union the eu leaders had set convergence criteria for joining the euro that were only monetary interest rates and inflation and fiscal budget deficits and debt there were no convergence criteria for productivity levels gdp growth investment or employment why because those were areas for the free movement of capital and labour and where capitalist production must be kept free of interference or direction by the state after all the eu project is a capitalist one this explains why the core countries of emu diverged from the periphery with a single currency the value differentials between the weaker states lower occ and the stronger higher occ were exposed with no option to compensate by the devaluation of any national currency or by scaling up overall production so the weaker capitalist economies in southern europe within the euro area lost ground to the stronger in the north franco german capital expanded into the south and east to take advantage of cheap labour there while exporting outside the euro area with a relatively competitive currency the weaker emu states built up trade deficits with the northern states and were flooded with northern capital that created property and financial booms that were out of line with growth in the productive sectors of the south even so none of this would have caused a crisis in the single currency union had it not been for a significant change in global capitalism the sharp decline in the profitability of capital in the major eu states as elsewhere after the end of the golden age of post war expansion this led to fall in investment growth productivity and trade divergence european capital following the model of the anglo saxon economies adopted neoliberal policies anti trade union laws deregulation of labour and financial markets cuts in public spending and corporate tax free movement of capital and privatisation the aim was to boost profitability this succeeded somewhat for the more advanced eu states of the north but less so for the south global slump then came the global financial crash and the great recession which exposed the fault lines in the single currency area the slump dramatically increased the divergent forces within the euro the fragmentation of capital flows between the strong and weak euro zone states exploded 1 the capitalist sectors of the richer economies like germany stopped lending directly to the weaker capitalist sectors in greece slovenia etc as a result in order to maintain a single currency for all the official monetary authority the european central bank and the national central banks had to provide the loans instead the euro system s target 2 settlement figures between the national central banks revealed this huge divergence within the euro zone the imposition of austerity measures by the franco german eu leadership on the distressed countries during the crisis was the result of the halfway house of euro criteria there was no full fiscal union tax harmonisation and automatic transfer of revenues to those national economies with deficits there was no automatic injection of credit to cover capital flight and trade deficits federal banking and there was no banking union with eu wide regulation where weak banks could be helped by stronger ones these conditions were the norm in full federal unions like the united states or the united kingdom instead in the euro zone everything had to be agreed by tortuous negotiation among the various states in this halfway house franco german capital was not prepared to pay for the excesses of the weaker capitalist states thus any bailout programmes were combined with austerity for those countries2 to make the people of the distressed states pay with cuts in welfare pensions and real wages and to repay virtually in full their creditors the banks of france germany and the uk the debt owed to the franco german banks was transferred to the eu state institutions and the international monetary fund in the case of greece probably in perpetuity 3 the ecb the eu commission and the governments of the euro zone proclaimed that austerity was the only way europe was to escape from the great recession and austerity in public spending could force convergence on fiscal accounts too 4 but the real aim of austerity was to achieve a sharp fall in real wages and cuts in corporate taxes and thus raise the share of profit and the profitability of capital indeed after a decade of austerity very little progress has been achieved in meeting fiscal targets particularly in reducing debt ratios and more important in reducing the imbalances within the euro zone on labour costs or external trade to make the weaker more competitive the adjusted wage share in national income defined here as compensation per employee as percentage of gdp at factor cost per person employed is the cost to the capitalist economy of employing the workforce wages and benefits as a percentage of the new value created each year every capitalist economy had managed to reduce labour s share of the new value created since 2009 labour has been paying for this crisis everywhere the evidence shows that those eu states that achieved a quicker recovery in the profitability of capital germany netherlands ireland etc were able to recover from the euro crisis faster while those that did not improve profitability stayed deep in depression eg greece one of the striking elements in the fall in labour s share of new value has been emigration this was one of the oca criteria for convergence during crises and it has become an important contributor in reducing costs for the capitalist sector in the larger economies like spain and smaller ones like ireland 5 before the crisis spain was the largest recipient of immigrants to its workforce from latin america portugal and north africa now there is net emigration even with these areas keynesians blame the crisis in the euro zone on the rigidity of the single currency area and on the strident austerity policies of the leaders of the euro zone like germany but the euro crisis is only partly a result of the policies of austerity austerity was pursued not only by the eu institutions but also by states outside the euro zone like the uk alternative keynesian policies of fiscal stimulus and or devaluation where applied have done little to end the slump households still suffered income loss austerity means a loss of jobs and services and reduction in nominal and real income keynesian policies mean a reduction in real income through higher prices a falling currency and eventually rising interest rates take iceland a tiny country outside the eu let alone the euro zone it adopted the keynesian policy of devaluation of the currency a policy not available to the euro zone member states but it still meant a 40 decline in average real incomes in euro terms and nearly 20 in krona terms since 2007 indeed in 2015 icelandic real wages were still below where they were in 2005 10 years earlier whereas real wages in the distressed emu states of ireland and portugal have recovered iceland s rate of profit plummeted from 2005 and eventually the island s property boom burst and along with it the banks collapsed in 2008 09 devaluation of the currency started in 2008 but profitability up to 2012 remained well under the peak level of 2004 profitability of capital in iceland has now recovered but emu distressed austerity states such as portugal and ireland have actually done better and even greek profitability has shown some revival those arguing for exiting the euro as a solution to the crisis hold that resorting to competitive devaluation would improve exports production wages and profits but suppose italy exits the euro and reverts to the lira while germany keeps the euro under the assumption that there are international production prices if italy produces with a lower technology level than that used by germany there is a loss of value from the italian to the german producer now if italy devalues its currency by half the german importer can buy twice as much of italy s exports but the italian importers can still only buy the same or smaller amount of german exports sure in lira terms there is no loss of profit but in international production value terms euro there is a loss the fall in the value rate of profit is hidden by the improvement in the money lira rate of profit in sum if italy devalues its currency its exporters may improve their sales and their money rate of profit overall employment and investments might also improve for a while but there is a loss of value inherent in competitive devaluation inflation of imported consumption goods will lead to a fall in real wages and the average rate of profit will eventually worsen with the concomitant danger of a domestic crisis in investment and production such are the consequences of devaluation of the currency the political forces that wish to break with the euro or refuse to join it have expanded electorally in many euro zone countries this year s eu elections could see populist euro sceptic parties take 25 of the vote and hold the balance of power in some states such as austria poland and italy yet the euro remains popular with the majority indeed pro euro sentiment has improved in 13 member states since they joined 6 with double digit bumps in austria finland germany and portugal even in italy which has witnessed a roughly 25 point decline around 60 of people still favour sharing a currency with their neighbours greeks are still 65 in favour what this tells me is that working people in even the weaker euro zone states reckon going it alone outside the eu would be worse than being inside and they are probably right ultimately whether the euro will survive in the next 20 years is a political issue will the people of southern europe continue to endure more years of austerity creating a whole lost generation of unemployed young people as has already happened actually the future of the euro will probably be decided not by the populists in the weaker states but by the majority view of the strategists of capital in the stronger economies will the governments of northern europe eventually decide to ditch the likes of italy spain greece etc and form a strong alliance around germany benelux and poland there is already an informal hanseatic league alliance being developed 7 the eu leaders and strategists of capital need fast economic growth to return soon failing which further political explosions are likely but at the start of 2019 the euro zone economies are slowing down as are those of the us and uk it may not be too long before the world economy drops into another slump then all bets would be off on the survival of the euro michael roberts blogs at notes 1 see 2 ibid 3 see 4 see 5 6 www bloomberg com graphics 2018 euro at 20 7

jan 24 2019 alasdair macleod abstract for decades western governments have been pursuing a policy of transferring wealth from the public to themselves their licensed banks and the banks favoured customers by means of interest rate suppression and monetary inflation consequently inflation of financial asset prices has benefited the financial sector to the detriment of those employed in the productive economy over time this has badly weakened productive capacity and the long term ability of the market economy to fund future government spending it is a situation which seems bound to eventually lead to major economic and monetary problems additionally global economic prospects have worsened considerably as a result of president trump s tariff wars against china and others empirical evidence from the 1930s as well as economic analysis illustrate how trade tariffs have a devastating effect on domestic economic activity a prospect wholly unexpected by today s economists the coming together of a trade induced slump and the public s discovery of its true losses through underreported wealth transfer by means of monetary inflation is set to become a major issue for fiat currencies worldwide risking a catastrophic loss of confidence in them we shall commence by explaining why trade tariffs are likely to be the trigger for a possible slump before moving on to the important issues that arise from the public s discovery of its own financial precariousness the discrediting of macroeconomic theories and the likely reactions in currency markets the trade tariff problem those worried by the bigger picture cannot fail to have noticed that globally there are now geopolitical shifts on a tectonic scale the american government is alienating china its key eurasian creditor which with its principal asian partners has been planning to reduce exposure to the dollar the influence of this movement against the dollar extends to china s trade counterparties nearly everywhere outside the united states this even includes japan which remains officially on side with america for now but her zaibatsu are being drawn into china s sphere of influence good europeans such as poland and hungary are hedging their dollar bets by accumulating gold reserves now that the silk road is transiting goods to and from the far east meanwhile there is no sign of america s twin deficits reducing and they are more likely to increase explained below particularly given an emerging global recession china will still have its trade surpluses with america but america is restricting chinese re investment in america and wherever it still has influence it is a deliberate policy to contain china s technological development but will have the effect of forcing chinese entities to instruct the people s bank pboc to swap their surplus dollars for yuan or another currency the pboc then has to decide whether to reinvest them in us treasuries leave them on deposit in american banks or just sell them the row over trade deficits and the introduction of tariffs by america is underestimated as a major cause of the global economic slowdown to guide us we have the precedent of the smoot hawley tariff act of 1930 which played a major part in driving the world into the depression china s economy is now contracting rapidly and while analysts are blaming china s shadow banking squeeze there can be no doubt that its export markets have contracted sharply as well it is this dimension one of contracting global trade for which china is the bellwether which few analysts know how to analyse and even fewer governments know how to handle let us walk through an example a welfare spending state such as the us facing a contraction in economic activity will experience a significant increase in government welfare spending at a time of falling tax revenues the budget deficit rapidly escalates unless it is offset by an increase in savings a rapidly increasing budget deficit must lead to a broadly matching increase in the trade deficit we can explain this with the following national accounting identity for which there can be no other result imports exports investment savings government spending taxes in other words a trade deficit is the net result of a shortfall in the combination of savings and budget deficits more correctly it applies to both capital and goods without distinction and is captured by balance of payments statistics the us has two problems with this issue not only does the budget deficit need funding by foreign investors recirculating their capital but the trade deficit will continue to rise irrespective of tariffs if the currency was to be fully recirculated from the trade deficit to fund the budget deficit the cost of that funding would be set mainly by domestic considerations this is unlikely to happen in america for political reasons we have seen president trump try to reduce the trade deficit by imposing tariffs it is clear he does not understand that his government is causing the trade deficit by running a budget deficit and when the trade deficit widens further as a consequence of the rising budget deficit in the coming year further restrictions on trade will also be unsuccessful and counterproductive assuming there is no increase in savings they are discouraged by neo keynesian government economists anyway then with the trade deficit still increasing it will be domestic production that ends up being curtailed it is the only way the sums can add up given the parlous condition of state finances in most advanced nations escalating deficits and tariffs in combination will end up squeezing both consumers and manufacturing businesses in all net importing countries unemployment then rises rapidly and as the smoot hawley episode informed us before long a recession becomes a deepening slump as all nations are sucked into a trade vortex in other words president trump s tariff wars are in large part responsible for the global economic slowdown worse the slowdown can be expected to feed on itself as an increasing trade deficit ends up collapsing domestic output this is the nightmare yet to come but it is not all we must put the trade issue to one side while we delve into an even larger issue that has undermined the economic performance of high spending welfare states for a considerable time and is likely to be exposed by the impending slump in international trade a conventional analysis of the current global outlook government statistics round the world which are alarming financial commentators now reflect stalling gdp growth those few of us who have been beating the drum of credit cycle theory and the inevitability of a destructive economic and monetary crisis a magnitude larger than any recently experienced are not yet being taken seriously our financial and economic futures are beginning to coalesce perhaps but the route towards and extent of a new credit cycle termination are unclear there are likely to be two broad possibilities the first suggests that central banks will attempt to save the world from recession through a renewed expansion of their balance sheets if necessary interest rate rises will be put on hold or perhaps temporarily reversed the creation of wealth through asset price inflation will resume and the credit crisis which ends all periods of credit expansion deferred perhaps for another year or so if the bull market in financial assets cannot be rescued in this manner the alternative may be brutal financial troubles surface stock markets crash and financial economic and monetary collapse are suddenly upon us perhaps in a different variation from the lehman crisis that s the white and black of it without much grey in between government economists and commentators are obviously preparing themselves for the first possibility with an easing of monetary policy enough to prevent anything worse than a brief mild recession collectively central banks have quietly been doing this since mid november unfortunately the policy often fails because a self feeding momentum of deteriorating conditions is already under way and it is too late there is therefore an element of hope over experience in the belief that an easing of monetary policy is all that is needed to keep economies bubbling along the businesses primarily affected by current conditions are the 80 measured by gdp that make up the small and medium size enterprises smes not normally worthy of macroeconomic headlines they are the riskier loans that offer banks the best lending margins banks whose confidence in the business outlook has improved in recent years have been increasing their loans of working capital to smes mark carney governor of the bank of england recently warned mps on the uk s treasury select committee that leveraged loans which are strongly related to bank credit leant to smes have all the hallmarks of the subprime mortgage bubble twelve years ago until last month carney also chaired the financial stability board hosted by the bank for international settlements so speaks for the wider banking community any lender who has ignored this danger is now on notice and will be more likely to withdraw loan facilities from its sme customers fear spreading over lending risk is why monetary easing following signs of trouble in credit markets often precipitates the crisis the authorities are trying to prevent the bank of england or the fed for that matter could even halve interest rates and announce a resumption of quantitative easing and despite a brief euphoric valuation moment in financial markets the signal sent of escalating credit risk could still become self fulfilling it appears financial markets and events generally have arrived close to this point having fallen sharply since last september stocks have had a brief recovery the recent fall in us treasury yields reflecting a flight into low risk bonds has now paused and yields have risen slightly central banks hope the process of bank credit creation will resume but based on experience from earlier credit cycles the next signal will probably come from the banks trying to reduce lending risk even further furthermore a central bank buying government debt from the banks which is what qe amounts to misdiagnoses the failure dealing with an evolving credit crisis is not helped by the establishment s self serving approach to economics and its belief that risk is caused entirely by free markets when the crisis is always the consequence of failed government economic and financial policies this article now proceeds to not only point out the dangers posed by trade tariffs but to draw the reader s attention to the most important failures of mainstream economic analysis and monetary policy in the context of what lies ahead we can identify the future risks to our savings and lifestyles through a combination of empirical precedence and the lodestar of sound economic theory as distinct from being misled by the government s self serving macroeconomics timing will then become the principal issue for investors and savers which must be assessed by them in the context of their own situations as time progresses but so that potential outcomes can be better understood an investor or saver must first appreciate how the state finances itself at his or her expense furthermore it must be recognised that state finances everywhere are rapidly deteriorating and the ability of their peoples to continue to support them are diminishing towards a destructive singularity the growth myth the common assumption that economic progress equates to growth in gdp is a fallacy and is only relevant to the state s finances a state s finances improve when gdp grows it is therefore hardly surprising that the arms of the state would have everyone believe that growth in gdp is synonymous with economic progress gdp is no more than a money total if you create more money in the form of base money or bank credit issued out of thin air the extent to which it ends up in the non financial economy simply inflates the gdp number the extra money can be spent uselessly or even destructively but gdp will still increase furthermore the inclusion of a government s economically destructive activities in gdp is a grievous error ranking closely with the carelessness of financial analysts not recognising that the only productive part of the economy is the private sector providing goods and services gdp therefore has nothing to do with an overall increase in prosperity it is the mirror opposite because monetary inflation the means by which gdp increases transfers wealth from ordinary people to the government the banks and their favoured customers so even though extra money leads to an increase in nominal gdp the average person employed in the non financial private sector is made poorer for governments and their epigones in the economics profession this is a truth too inconvenient to address they would rather pursue the tired keynesian argument that a little monetary and deficit stimulus benefits the private sector it was a seductive argument when this story evolved from the thornton bagehot concept of a central bank being the lender of last resort but today it has become increasingly clear that what was intended to be a one off stimulus to get things going has become both a continual failure and an accelerating currency debasement to boot not only is it in a government s perceived interest to look no further than an increase in gdp but the abuse of statistics by way of the introduction of a price deflator has reached remarkable levels in the alice in wonderland of government economics a price deflator is necessary to measure the increase in welfare liabilities arising from indexation indexation has simply become a cost to be controlled by fiddling the figures the art of concealing price inflation independent estimates of price inflation in the united states are in the region of nine or ten percent annually compared with the most recent official estimate of 1 9 governments can cheat in this way because there is no such thing as an indisputable price index each person has an experience of prices that is personal and the variation of price inflation experiences differs widely this means governments can construct an index which cannot be challenged on the basis it is wrong because any alternative calculation is similarly flawed and as we all know the government is always assumed to be right by default government calculations of price inflation around the world are also harmonised which means they draw further credibility from being standardised internationally and the flaws are ubiquitous it amounts to a global concealment of the effects of monetary inflation on the wealth producers in non financial economies allowing almost unlimited creation of new currency because government statisticians say the price effect of monetary inflation is minimal does not mean that it is so it is inevitable that at some point this fraudulent representation of the effect of monetary debasement on prices risks leading to a systemic shock and thus fatally undermines any residual trust in fiat currencies john williams of shadowstats com has been pointing out the corruption of us government inflation statistics for years the process of deliberate data corruption started in 1980 and williams estimates price inflation today to be in line with chapwood s calculation of nine or ten per cent when all the changes to the state s calculation methods are removed furthermore according to shadowstats annual price inflation averaging close to these levels has existed since 2001 admittedly with some variation severely denting the purchasing power of the salaries of ordinary people it is no wonder so many families resort to consumer credit to finance their day to day subsistence and life styles therefore the transfer of wealth from the productive economy by means of monetary debasement including the reduction in real terms of the value of wages has been compounding at a far greater rate than official statistics would have us believe consequently the us s non financial non government economy has been in a long term decline in absolute terms for some time the depredations on personal wealth and wages in the productive sector are only made tolerable by economic progress which as we have noted above cannot be captured in gdp statistics economic progress always emanates from free markets which are under increasing suppression from tax demands and escalating currency debasement the erosion of wealth in the productive base might appear to have been moderated by the price inflation of financial assets itself another source of tax revenue by excluding financial assets from price inflation statistics the illusion of wealth creation through rising financial asset prices acts as a convenient cover for currency dilution the expansion of mortgage finance subsidised by suppressed interest rates creates a similar effect by driving up house prices which then become eligible as collateral for further personal loans if you want an explanation of income and wealth disparities look no further monetary inflation benefits people employed in financial activities at the expense of genuine producers of goods and services this can only work until the productive non government non financial sector runs too low on its collective wealth to support the burden of the rest then the whole economy enters a catatonic state vide greece italy spain france a rough guide to the cumulative wealth transfer effect and loss of true wage income in america can be obtained by deflating the gdp figure by a number closer to the chapwood and shadowstats estimates instead of those of the bureau of economic analysis if we make a rough assessment based on an annual compounding loss of the dollar s domestic purchasing power averaging a conservative seven per cent since 2000 today s price level is about 250 higher than then which feels more correct than the bea s official estimate of a cumulative rise in prices of only 48 eventually the wider public is bound to rumble the deceit discontent is already on the increase from a general public aware something is badly wrong but it is not yet sure what it is it should then be no surprise that the accumulation of currency debasement since 1980 will lead sooner or later to a larger crisis than seen in the last thirty years and possibly over the entire course of the fiat money experience the end of macroeconomic posturing we are considering the broadest of policy overviews broader even than a trade induced slump they are the result of decades of monetary corruption the consequences of which are being increasingly covered up by statistical manipulation failures of banking systems whole countries and even entire economic blocs such as the eu are concerns for individual credit crises the true problem lies buried more deeply in the tension created between wealth destruction and monetary creation it can only end with the myth that free markets can be managed and improved by monetary manipulation and government intervention finally being overturned the economics of free markets had to be discredited for government control and intervention to be credible the abandonment of free markets has been a gradual process that dates on some measures to before the creation of the fed in december 1913 that event marked the first successful attempt by the leading american banks to gain full monetary control and was further consolidated when the fed became operationally integrated with the us government the economic justification for the creation of a monetary monopoly followed later with mathematical economists in the 1930s such as irvin fisher and jm keynes working up ideas to provide theoretical cover central to the implementation of their ideas was a split from what was subsequently termed microeconomics which reflects our day to day experience the new social science of macroeconomics was somehow above both our experiences and established classical economics the creation of macroeconomic theory was the method by which say s law was deliberately abandoned the development of national statistics was with the intention of feeding the equations of the new mathematically based macroeconomics the abandonment of sound money was the next step necessary to permit the further advancement of the mathematical illusion by feeding in monetary inflation that was justified by claiming that dispensing with gold backing was necessary to remove the risk of price deflation it was then consolidated with an unproved assertion that rising prices stimulate consumption when in fact they are simply the primary consequence of monetary debasement the expansion of money and bank credit creates a temporary illusion of prosperity while concealing the wealth transfer from ordinary people to the government its licensed banks and their favoured customers the economic progress that has benefited us all has emanated entirely from an increasingly supressed and diminishing free market despite all government depredations upon it the pace of depredation has accelerated in recent years but is now at a rate where widespread economic destruction is becoming visible notably in failing statist nations within the european union america and britain are treading the same path with the supposed trade off between wealth destruction and asset inflation increasingly difficult to sustain macroeconomics as an economic subject was invented by agents of the state to justify giving the state control over free markets it has ended up fooling everyone but just as communism undermined itself by ignoring the socialist calculation issue macroeconomics also appears to be moving towards its finality conclusion there are warning signals that the crisis that ends all monetary expansions may be upon us with an obvious slowdown in global economic activity it follows an unprecedented period of monetary debasement the price effects of which have been concealed through the subterfuge of government statistical manipulation it is a problem that has been growing over several credit cycles since the 1980s the consequence has been an accelerating wealth transfer from the productive segment of economies to governments the banks and their preferred customers over time this has undermined core economic activity leaving governments with twin deficits in a precarious position revelation of the full debilitating effects of the prolonged wealth transfer from productive economic sectors in the welfare driven nations is only a matter of time but probably requires a trigger for it to be widely understood that trigger seems set to evolve from a potentially rapid contraction of global trade brought about in large measure by american tariff policies the combination of a trade induced slump and a public realisation that it has been a longstanding victim of a multi government ponzi scheme is likely not only to worsen the upcoming credit crisis but to fatally undermine unbacked fiat currencies to boot it should be noted that commissions and fees earned by banks and other participants in the finance sector are included in the productive economy for the purpose of this analysis see chapwoodindex com and bea gov data prices inflationsee say s law defined the relationship between production

by at davos switzerland every year the global capitalist elite gather to party and to prepare for the year ahead this year more than 1500 private jets will reportedly fly in thousands more of their underling staff will travel via business class to handle their personal and corporate logistics shielded from the media and the pubic the big capitalists share views in back rooms and listen to experts on finance government policy technology and the economy the experts are especially probed to identify and explain the next black swan or gray rhino event about to erupt wealthy celebrities are invited to entertain them as well after evening dinner and cocktails but the real networking goes on privately afterwards in small groups or one on one among the big capitalists themselves or in private meetings with heads of state finance ministers and central bank chairmen typically each annual meeting has a theme this year there are several the slowing global economy the fracturing of the international trade system the growing levels of unsustainable debt everywhere volatile financial asset markets with asset bubbles beginning to deflate rising political instability and autocratic drift in both the advanced and emerging economies accelerating income inequality worldwide to mention just a short list on the eve of this year s world economic forum gathering some of the most powerful wealthy and more prescient capitalists have begun to speak out to their capitalist cousins raising red flags about what they believe is an approaching crisis ray dalio the billionaire who found and manages the world s biggest hedge fund bridgewater associates warned that he and other investors had squeezed financial markets to such levels where it is difficult to see where you can squeeze further he publicly admitted in a bloomberg news interview that in the future profits will be low for a very very long time the era of central banks providing free money low rates and excess liquidity have run their course according to dalio he added the global economy is mired in dangerously high levels of debt comparing it to the 1930s paul tudor jones another big finance capitalist similarly warned of unsustainable debt levels created by companies binging on cheap credit since 2009 that could be systemically threatening not just government debt but especially corporate debt where levels in the us alone have doubled to more than 9 trillion since 2009 most of it high risk junk bond and nearly as risky bbb investment grade corporate bond debt almost as worrisome one might add is the now more than 1 trillion leverage loan market debt in the us i e loan equivalent of junk bonds us household debt is also now approaching 15 trillion and us national government debt at 21 trillion is about to surge over the next decade to 33 trillion due to the trump 2018 tax cuts and that s not counting trillions more in us state and local government debt or the tens of trillions of new dollarized debt undertaken by emerging market economies since 2010 or the 5 trillion in non performing bank loans in europe and japan or the even more private sector debt escalation in china corporate debt levels are not alone the problem however debt can rise so long as financial asset prices and real profits do so i e provide the cash flow available to service the debt but when profits and asset prices of stocks bonds derivatives currency exchange rates commodity futures etc no longer rise or start to turn down then debt service principal interest cannot be repaid defaults often follow causing investor confidence to slide real investment employment and household incomes thereafter collapse and the real economy is dragged down in turn the real decline further exacerbates the collapse of financial asset prices and precipitates a mutual feedback of financial and real economic collapse and financial markets began to deflate in 2018 and it is now becoming increasingly clear that the real side of the global economy is slowing rapidly as well in february 2018 the first early warning appeared for financial markets stocks plunged in the us europe and even china they temporarily recovered a dead cat bounce as they say before an even deeper decline in the fall then oil and commodity futures prices collapsed by 40 or more in late summer early fall 2018 stock markets followed again in october december 2018 by 30 40 in us china europe and key emerging markets key emerging market currencies argentina turkey indonesia brazil south africa all fell precipitously as well and housing prices from the uk to australia to china to new york began to implode as the year ended in january 2019 stock markets recovered i e a classic short term bull market recovery in what is today s fundamentally long term global bear market dalio s and jones worries of unsustainable debt and pending crisis have started to become real in other words becoming real as well is evidence of emerging defaults a critical phase that typically follows asset markets decline and slowing profits in the us there s the sears default with jcpenney in the wings and the giant corporation once the largest in the world the general electric corp slouching toward default its global profits slowing and stock price imploding ge is now desperately selling off its best assets to raise cash to pay its excess debt it s not alone scores of energy companies involved in us shale oil and gas production are teetering on the brink in europe there s deepening troubles at deutschebank and just about all the italian banks and ubs in switzerland and the greek banks in japan there s trillions of dollars in non performing bank loans as well which japan s central bank continues to cover up and then there s china with more than 5 trillion in bad loans held by local governments by shadow bankers and by its state owned enterprises that the china central bank and government keep bailing out by issuing trusted loans i e equivalent of junk bonds in us default cracks have begun to appear everywhere in the global economy in other words major indicators that the excess debt accumulation and financial bubbles of the past decade cannot be serviced principal interest paid and have begun to negatively impact the global economy what s becoming clear is that the next crisis will not emerge from the housing sector with excess debt and price bubbles driven by subprime mortgage loans and related financial derivatives what s more likely is that the next crisis will emerge from debt defaults and collapsing real investment by non financial corporations moreover the tipping point is nearer than most in business or media will admit trump s 2018 tax cuts simply threw a veil over the real condition of corporate performance in the us this past year the tax cuts provided a windfall one time subsidy to corporations bottom line it is estimated that us s p 500 corporations profits were boosted 22 by the trump windfall tax cuts alone since s p 500 profits for 2018 were roughly 27 it means actual profits were barely 5 that s the real situation going into 2019 a condition that assures us stock markets junk bond markets and leveraged loan markets in particular will experience even greater contraction in 2019 than they did in 2018 the bubbles will continue to pop in the global economy it is even more evident that by the end of 2019 it is likely there will be recession in wide sectors of the real global economy amidst further asset markets price declines in europe the growth engine of germany is showing sure signs of slowing manufacturing and industrial production in the closing months of 2018 fell by 1 9 after a gdp decline in the third quarter 2018 another fourth quarter 2018 german contraction will mean a technical recession equal to at least a third of all the eurozone economy as goes germany goes europe france and italy manufacturing are also contracting nearly having stagnated at 0 2 in the third quarter the europe economy in general may have slipped into recession already and all that before the negative effects of a uk brexit or an italian banks implosion or deepening protests in france are further felt in emerging market economies the steady rise of the us dollar in 2018 driven by rising us central bank interest rates devastated emerging market economies across the board rising dollar values translated into corresponding emerging market currency collapse that triggered capital flight out of these economies and their falling stock and bond markets in turn to stem the outflow their central banks raised interest rates which precipitated deep recession in the real economy while their collapsing currencies generated higher import prices and general inflation in their economies as well that was the story from argentina to brazil to turkey to south africa and even to asia in places the us halting of interest rate hikes in 2019 may relieve pressure on emerging market economies somewhat in 2019 but that easing will be more than offset by china s 2019 economic slowdown now underway in the second half of 2018 investment consumer spending and manufacturing all slowed markedly in china officially at 6 6 for 2018 according to china statistics china s real economy is no doubt growing less than 6 due to the methods used to estimate growth in china its manufacturing began to contract in late 2018 and with it a significant slowdown in private investment and even consumer spending on autos and other durable goods china s slowing will mean less demand for emerging market economies products and commodities including oil and industrial metals a respite for emerging market economies from the us dollar rising will thus be offset by china slowing when both financial asset markets and the real economy are together slowing it is a particularly strong red flag warning for the economic road ahead and more contractions in stocks and other financial assets together with slowing of manufacturing housing and gdp in europe us and japan in 2019 are likely which means trouble ahead in 2019 along with all the data increasingly pointing to financial asset deflation gaining a longer term foothold and with real economy indicators like manufacturing housing gdp exports as well now flashing red there is also a growing list of political hotspots and potential tail risks emerging in the global economy some of the black swans are identifiable some yet to be in the us the government shutdown and the prospect of policy deadlock between the parties for two more years could qualify as a source of further economic disruption in europe there are several tail risks the brexit situation coming to a head in april the challenge to the eurozone by the new italian populist government the chronic and deep street protests continuing in france and the general rightward social and political drift throughout eastern europe in latin america there s the extremely repressive policies of bolsonaro in brazil and macri in argentina which could end in mass public uprisings at some point in asia there s corruption and scandals in malaysia and india and then there s the us trade war with china which some factions in the us are trying to leverage to launch a new cold war not least there s the potential collapse of negotiations between the us and north korea that could lead to renewed threats of military conflict all these political instabilities given their number and scope if left unresolved or allowed to worsen will have a further negative effect on business and consumer confidence now already slowing rapidly and in turn investment and therefore economic growth ray dalio s and tudor jones warnings on the eve of davos have been echoed by a growing list of capitalist notables and their government servants and echoes imf chairperson christine lagarde has been repeatedly declaring publicly that global trade and the economy are slowing reflecting europe in particular where exports are even more critical to the economy she has especially been warning about a potential severe us china trade war disrupting the global trading system and global economy in turn the imf has been issuing repeated downward adjustments of its global economic forecasts so too has the world bank as have a growing number of big bank research departments from nomura bank in japan to ubs bank in europe former us central bank chairs janet yellen and ben bernanke have also jumped in and have been raising red flags about the course of the us and global economies former fed chair greenspan has even declared the us is already on a recession path from which it can t now extricate itself given all the emerging corroborating data the red flags and warnings about the current state of the global economy and the growing global political uncertainties the dalios the jones and others among the davos crowd are especially worried this year on the eve of the forum s first day on january 23 2019 a leading discussion topic among the cocktail parties is the buzz about the just leaked private newsletter from billionaire seth klarman who heads one of the world s biggest funds the baupost group in his newsletter leaked to the new york times and widely circulated among early davos crowd attendees klarman reportedly chides his readers investors about not paying more attention to the social and political instabilities growing worldwide about trump s direction which is quite dangerous and the us in effect retreating from global leadership leaving a dangerous vacuum behind investors have also become too complacent about global debt and risk levels now rising dangerously he argues it could all very well lead to a financial panic he adds the us in particular is at an inflection point he ominously concludes by the time such a crisis hits it will likely be too late to get our house in order the recent statements by dalio tudor jones klarman and the others reminds one of the last crisis and crash of 2008 when charlie prince ceo of citigroup the biggest bank at the time was asked after the crisis why he didn t see it coming and do something to avoid the toxic mortgage derivatives bomb and protect his investors and customers prince replied he did see it coming but could do nothing to stop it his investors and customers demanded his bank continue like the other banks were investing in subprime mortgages lending to shadow banks selling risky derivatives and thereby continuing to make money for them just as the other banks were doing charlie s response why he did nothing to stop it or prepare was when you come to the dance you have to dance no doubt the davos crowd will be partying and dancing over the next several days in their securely gated posh switzerland retreat after all the last ten years has increased their capital incomes by literally tens of trillions of dollars and capitalists are driven by a mindless herd mentality once they ve made money they believe they can continue doing so forever they believe the money music will never stop one can only wonder if they ll be dancing later this year to the same song as charlie s in 2008
overview the us dollar is paring yesterday s gains against most of the major and emerging market currencies sterling pushed above 1 31 an 11 week high on news that the dup would support prime minister s plan b that calls for limits on the backstop with ireland something that the ec and ireland have indicated are not on the table global equities are finishing the week on a firm note nearly all the markets but india rose in asia while in europe the dow jones stoxx 600 gapped higher as it did a week ago to see its best level since december 4 if modest gains can be retained today the benchmark will close higher for the fourth consecutive week the s p 500 comes into today off about 1 for the week threatening to end its three week advance asia pacific japan reported tokyo cpi figures for january which are reported a month ahead of the national figures and is often seen as a lead indicator headline cpi rose by 0 4 twice the median forecasts and follows the upward revision in the december series to 0 4 from 0 3 the core rate which excludes fresh food rose 1 1 compared with 0 9 previously it was expected to be unchanged although this was an upside surprise the market did not seem to react much in the middle of the week the boj has shaved its growth and inflation forecasts india s high court upheld a law that in essence prevents business founders from regaining control of the failed business this is seen helping banks resolve the bad loan burden which is estimated around 210 bln according to reports there is an important case from a steel company coming up shortly for

unchanged on the week against the japanese yen it has traded in a little less than a one yen range all week it remains spitting distance of jpy110 00 where a 1 2 bln option expires today the dollar has not traded above there so far this month initial support is seen around jpy109 40 the australian dollar stabilized after slipping to new lows for the move near 0 7075 its nearly 1 decline this week leads the majors as the market prices in a greater chance of a rate cut nearby resistance is seen in the 0 7130 area the chinese yuan strengthened by 0 35 today the most in a couple of weeks some linked the yuan s gains to reports that us treasury secretary mnuchin said the currency was part of the trade talks the us can push for implementation of g20 best practices of letting the markets determine exchange rates more transparency of intervention and the like but it will be hard pressed to make a case that the yuan is significantly undervalued europe for the first time the ecb altered its risk assessment between staff updates and took us and many others by surprise this may reflect a greater sense of urgency or it may also have been dictated by the need to remain credible in the face of the poor pmis downward revisions to growth forecasts and as draghi noted international uncertainty the hawkish members appear to have strategically retreated ostensibly to be in a better position to shape the policy response the evolution of draghi s references a new tltro shows that it is becoming more salient an announcement is likely at the next meeting in early march even if not all the details draghi also seemed to validate the market pushing the first hike into 2020 following news earlier this week that the german manufacturing pmi fell below the 50 boom bust level for the first time in four years investors learned today that the ifo survey fell for a fifth month in january the overall reading fell to 99 1 from 101 in december the drop in the expectations component 94 2

certain optimism over brexit now that lifted sterling above 1 31 earlier today a level not seen since november 8 however may s plan b even with dup support seems like a non starter the idea of a backstop was to be in place in case a deal was not struck having a time limit on it defeats the purpose and shifts the burden to the ec from the uk the uk could play obstructionist until the time limit expires the ec and ireland have already rejected it may might be more support for her bill however as it may be seen by some brexiters to be preferable to a referendum that could see remain win or an election that could see labour win even if may s bills wins it is not clear how this forwards the negotiations with the ec the euro slipped through 1 13 yesterday but did not close below it and has edged higher today some chunky options that are expiring today and could impact trading there is a 1 3 bln euro option at 1 13 and nearly 660 mln euros at 1 1325 a bit further up in the 1 1350 1

indicated the china and the us are miles and miles apart but tacked on that both sides want a deal to take some of the sting away from the assessment treasury secretary mnuchin played down the trade

will we see a recession and a rally in gold in 2019 or 2020 we will see a recession and a rally in gold in 2019 or 2020 true or false we invite you to read our today s article about recession in 2020 narrative and find out what it all means for the gold market 114 months so long is the current us economic expansion it officially started in june 2009 and if the country avoids recession until july 2019 the uptrend in the business cycle will exceed 120 months becoming the longest expansion since at least 1857 when the nber began recording economy last year we analyzed the popular claim that the current expansion is so long that it must end soon surprisingly for us we reached similar conclusions to janet yellen who said once that expansions do not die of old age however many analysts present more sophisticated arguments for the upcoming crisis for example morgan stanley has recently estimated the odds of recession in the us at 15 percent in 2019 and 30 percent in 2020 larry summers the former treasury secretary has gone even further putting the chances of a recession in the us within the next two years at about 50 percent among institutions and people warning against the upcoming downturn are also brunello rosa and nouriel roubini who forecast recession in 2020 as roubini predicted the great recession it is worthwhile to examine carefully their article the makings of a 2020 recession and financial crisis especially that the authors list 10 reasons justifying their prediction by 2020 stimulus provided by accommodative fiscal policy will run out the rising inflation due to poorly timed stimulus will force the fed to overtighten its monetary policy trump s trade wars will escalate other us policies restricting the foreign investments and immigration will add stagflationary pressure global growth especially in china and emerging markets will slow down europe too will experience slower growth because of the monetary policy tightening and trade frictions us and global equity markets are frothy so there will be a correction in risky assets when the correction occurs the risk of illiquidity and fire sales will become more severe confronted with slower growth trump will attack the fed more directly and will become even more hawkish in foreign policy potentially triggering a military conflict the space for fiscal or monetary stimulus is limited now so the policymakers will not prevent the deep recession roubini and rossa make some good points that s for sure the correction in the stock market has already started but we believe that it s actually something positive the fed is moving off the monetary drip which has to come with painful adjustments correction today means lower risk of harsh burst tomorrow and although the risky assets are subject to repricing so far we do not see systematic risk emanating from the us financial system actually the financial conditions although tightened remain accommodative as the chart below shows chart 1 chicago fed national financial conditions index red line st louis fed financial stress index blue line and kansas fed financial stress index green line from january 2009 to november 2018 we totally agree that fiscal stimulus will run out by 2020 but it does not necessarily imply a recession after all the economy grew also before trump s tax cuts slowdown yes recession not necessarily however we do not buy point no 6 we don t want to argue that europe can t experience slower growth but not due to the monetary tightening and trade frictions actually europe may benefit from the trade dispute between us and china and american and chinese companies may trade more with european partners and although the ecb stopped its quantitative easing it will reinvest the principals payments from maturing bonds and it will not raise its interest rates through summer 2019 so there is hardly any monetary tightening in the eurozone other points are also debatable as the pace of money supply growth slows down see the chart below inflation may remain constrained politics is always quite unpredictable but it s not so obvious that trump will escalate the trade conflict with china endlessly or engage in some military conflicts if china makes some concessions just like mexico and canada did in case of nafta trump could strike a deal chart 2 us m1 red line and m2 blue line annual growth rates from january 2014 to november 2018 does it mean that we do not see any risks not at all we do see many risks on a global scale china is probably the biggest question mark the indebtedness is growing and one day the red dragon may fall under the burden of all this debt within the us we see the non financial corporate leverage as the biggest current threat during a downturn a lot of companies will go bankrupt which would worsen the situation however high risks are not immediate risks to sum up expansions do not die of old age they end because of significant imbalances in the economy and excessive monetary tightening which reveals them however although the fed tightens its stance the interest rates are still below neutral level while financial conditions remain favorable and regarding potential imbalances the household balance sheets are not strained see the chart below the corporate sectors look more vulnerable but we do not see a massive overinvestment in capex as before previous recessions chart 3 household debt service payments as a percent of disposable personal income from q1 2009 to q2 2018 what does it all mean for the gold market the lack of clear typical warning signs that preceded the past recessions put the recession in 2020 narrative into question it weakens the arguments saying that gold has to rally soon as the next crisis is just behind the corner having said that gold may shine even without a recession all it needs to shine is the bear market in the us dollar it s too early to call it but if the fiscal stimulus and monetary tightening run out of steam the greenback will lose an important part of its support which would allow gold to catch its breath thank you if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know

rajiv servansingh incorrect to assume that mauritius would be resilient according to the economic observer although the threat of a global economic recession during this year is real it is notoriously difficult to gauge the real extent of the threat in this highly volatile environment in which political events such as donald trump s attempts to impose his protectionist agenda in the u s or the brexit conundrum are causing immense damage to the global economy under the circumstances it would be incorrect to assume that mauritius would be resilient to such a severe slowdown in the global economy it is also true however that the existence of such a threat need not necessarily spell all doom and gloom i have always held the view that for a small island developing economy like ours an intelligent redeployment of our resources and imaginative proactive economic policies coupled with smart economic trade diplomacy should allow us to keep our heads above water indeed a slowdown in the global economic environment may be a catalyst for much needed internal reforms and transformations which seem unrealizable if economic prospects look relatively good and economic operators as well as government feel that muddling through is a better option that the risks associated with real reforms publicité the areas most vulnerable to a global economic recession would of course be those that depend on foreign markets he says our exports of goods such as textiles and garments to mostly european and the american markets will be the most affected because these are the economies which will bear the brunt of the recession the fall in aggregate demand in these economies which is a key characteristic of a recession will certainly affect our exports similarly in case of a global economic recession our export of services such as tourism will be threatened it is well known that in such times of economic uncertainty even the wealthy are loathing at spending on such items as travelling for leisure let alone the fact that the tourists visiting mauritius seem to hail more and more from the middle and upper middle classes which are most directly affected in case of a recession for the economist rajiv servansingh there are no magical solutions especially within a short time frame of a few months however learning from experience after the most recent great financial crisis of 2008 it is clear that the knee jerk reaction of neo liberal ideologues to have recourse to austerity measures is a losing proposition the lesson that has been learned by all those who are not blinded by theoretical and a historical ideology is that keynesian economics have proven to be the most effective tools of intervention in the case of severe economic slowdown dr vinaye ancharaz downside risks to global growth in 2019 abound vinaye ancharaz the economist enunciates that those who predict a global recession in 2019 are probably not reading the economic data correctly or they don t trust reports from certain reputable institutions the imf for example forecasts global output to grow at 3 7 in 2019 this isn t just a respectable figure it is also the same as growth rates in 2017 and 2018 and the highest since 2011 in other words world gdp growth is plateauing off the world economy is not slowing down it will continue to grow at the same rate as the past two years so if we are to trust the forecasts there will be no global recession in 2019 however downside risks to global growth in 2019 abound he adds these include escalating trade tensions between the us and china rising interest rates in the us an unfavourable brexit deal and political uncertainty in europe and china s heavy debt burden to mention just a few while we hope for the best let us keep in mind that any adverse event may send global growth downhill the question of mauritius facing a global recession in 2019 does not arise since there will be no global recession however the question of economic resilience remains a pertinent one in any case he claims the mauritian economy is a resilient one and a sequence of events in the economic history of the country have proved it most recently when the financial crisis hit gdp growth at home dipped to 3 1 in 2009 from a peak of 5 5 the year before remarkably growth stayed positive in mauritius while it went into negative territory in some of our comparators such as singapore malaysia and ireland yet these economies were touted as some of the most robust and resilient in the world when economic crisis struck again in 2011 gdp growth in mauritius took a downturn but still averaged a respectable 3 5 over the next 7 years he puts forward that the resilience of the mauritian economy is the result of a confluence of factors a diversified industrial base a dynamic private sector a robust public private partnership underpinned by strong institutions and pro active government policies in times of adversity time and again the mauritian government has responded to economic shocks with ingenious policies and the private sector has reacted appropriately to the policy stimulus this is set to continue in the future additionally he highlights that as an export dependent economy the extent to which mauritius would be affected by a global recession will depend also on how it will impact our major export markets with or without recession the uncertainty around the brexit negotiations is likely to hinder mauritius exports to the uk especially as we approach the fateful date of march 29 2019 rather than overcoming the impact of a recession the best course of action is to prepare the economy to sustain it this calls for greater diversification both in terms of products and markets and a structural shift towards more resilient products and services unfortunately the path of modernization that mauritius has taken with a focus on new sectors like global business real estate and entertainment and recreation puts the country at greater risk it is time to rethink of our development strategy especially since some of these sectors have not delivered on their development promise swadicq nuthay all our sectors will be affected the economist swadicq nuthay asserts that the outlook for the global economy has worsened with many economists now predicting a global slowdown in 2019 on account of ongoing u s china trade dispute worsening corporate earnings mounting global debt and china s deteriorating economic indices however we are not talking about global economic recession similar to 2008 but rather a global slowdown in its latest report the world bank has revised its forecast for the global economy downwards from 3 1 to 3 0 in 2018 from 3 0 to 2 9 in 2019 and from 2 9 to 2 8 in 2020 citing rising downside risks similarly former chairperson of the fed janet yellen also expressed her concerns about mounting corporate debt high levels of corporate leverage could prolong the downturn and lead to lots of bankruptcies christine lagarde the managing director of the imf also stressed on the negative impact of the trade tension between the u s and china on the global economy there are four main areas of worry that taken together suggest the global economy may be in a more fragile place than it was even at the eve of lehman s demise a decade ago first as the bank of international settlements has repeatedly warned there is a record level of indebtedness in the global economy it is not just the amount of public and private debt which is worrying but also the deterioration in average quality towards the end of december 2017 the total global debt was estimated at 237 trillion compared to 167 trillion in 2007 a full 70 trillion above pre lehman levels according to the institute of international finance us public debt to gdp ratio has risen to over 105 percent of gdp from around 65 percent of gdp in 2008 with projections of a continued rise in the euro zone too debt is now higher 98 in spain and italy s public debt already high in 2008 has now breached 130 percent of gdp higher than its 2008 level for some sectors and regions corporate indebtedness is at 20 year highs second he states that with quantitative easing having left central banks with a record 15 trillion of assets on their balance sheets and interest rates still close to record lows there is limited room for a robust monetary policy response to another shock third he says the political center which was strong in 2008 has frayed considerably in almost all major economies populism of both the far right and far left variety is rising partly in response to the crisis fourth is the collapse of trust and weakening in the international order the u s is pursuing not just an empty chair policy at international forums such as the g 7 and the g 20 which were crucial in marshalling international co operation to tackle the last crisis but also a bullying strategy vis a vis the rest of the world headwinds stemming from a global economic slowdown will adversely impact our export earnings which are already affected by falling sugar prices the economist adds a slowdown in the us economic growth and the uncertainty surrounding brexit will also impact on the growth of the manufacturing sector already facing tough conditions on account of rising costs and declining productivity exports as a percentage of gdp has gone down from 23 in 2015 to 16 in 2018 a weakening global economic growth would also affect the tourism industry as well as the financial sector particularly the offshore segment as we ll likely see a decline in international trade and investment flows he maintains the latest figures show a worsening of the current account deficit to rs 9 8bn in 3rd quarter of 2018 as compared to a deficit of rs 5 2bn in 3rd quarter of 2017 the country has recorded an overall balance of payments deficit of rs 6 9 billion in 2018q3 against a surplus of rs 5 9 billion in 2017q3 the surpluses in the capital account have not been sufficient to offset the current account deficit with the main macroeconomic indicators already in the red public debt at rs 307 2bn in september 18 i e 64 2 of gdp current account deficit at 6 2 of gdp budget deficit for 2018 2019 at 3 2 of gdp there is almost no leeway for us to shield ourselves from the potential adverse impact of an upcoming global economic slowdown he underlines that most economists are predicting a global economic slowdown not a global recession at this stage in the world bank s latest publication global economic prospects jan 19 global growth is projected to decline as economic slack dissipates monetary policy accommodation in advanced economies is removed and global trade gradually slows a global slowdown in economic activity will affect all sectors of our economy exports will particularly suffer earnings from both the manufacturing and the tourism industry will decline there will be a negative impact on the financial sector as well with a decrease in capital inflows and economic activity in general being heavily dependent on imports of food and fuel exchange rate movements and global commodity prices will have a heavy impact on the cpi our import bill as well barlen pillay there is no expected decline in global output secretary general of mcci barlen pillay maintains that in the face of tightening financial conditions geo political tensions policy uncertainties and downside risks to the world economic outlook in 2019 economists from the imf the oecd and the world bank alike have downgraded their growth forecasts for the year 2019 nonetheless the cyclical turnaround in the global economy observed since mid 2016 is expected to continue in 2018 19 whilst there is a predicted slowdown in global growth we are not in a global recession in 2019 economic growth is still expected to be of approximately 3 7 percent similar to growth in 2017 and 2018 he states that according to the international monetary fund imf there must be an extended decrease in per capita gross domestic product gdp worldwide for there to be a recession this fall in global output must coincide with a weakening of other macroeconomic indicators such as trade capital flows and employment nonetheless there is no expected decline in global output in 2019 gdp shall grow by 3 7 percent according to imf figures mauritius has in recent years shown some resilience to the global economic downturn of 2008 2009 nonetheless the mauritian growth rate has decreased from an average of more than 5 pre crisis to an average growth of approximately 3 5 post 2008 mauritius will inevitably be affected by any slowdown in world economic growth
he noted that beijing s choice is obvious given the fact that the us dollar remains strong and could even appreciate against others in which liquid debt instruments are denominated in addition an actual move by china away from us treasury instruments would quickly be discerned and might add to building pressures towards a global markets panic he presumed according to ortel the people s republic also faces mounting internal pressures because they have inflated a massive investment bubble in projects that likely are loss making using strict accounting considering the above i imagine that china will retain massive holdings of us government debt even and perhaps especially in a full scale trade war should one materialize the wall street analyst predicted drifting away from the greenback however at the same time china has clearly demonstrated its intent to move away from the greenback step by step the people s republic is boosting its gold reserves and switching to national currencies in bilateral trade with russia iran pakistan it also signalled support for turkey s plan to ditch the dollar furthermore the beijing led one belt and one road project envisages the introduction of swap facilities in the countries of the region involved in the endeavour to promote the use of the yuan mcgregor argues that one should not overestimate the apparent shift the us dollar the euro and japanese yen are considered safe haven investments and will continue to be so he said china is forbidden to use the us dollar when conducting trade deals with north korea and iran due to economic trade sanctions if the chinese use us dollars on such occasions they stand the risk of getting arrested just like meng wanzhou if they make an appearance in canada he admitted that in regards to russia chinese law has encouraged chinese companies to use the russian rouble on financial transactions but not sure if it s on account of washington led economic sanctions imposed on moscow a rush out of us treasury debt by china highly unlikely
today we are fortunate to present a guest contribution written by ashoka mody charles and marie visiting professor in international economic policy woodrow wilson school princeton university previously he was deputy director in the international monetary fund s research and european departments the recent celebratory comments on the euro s 20th anniversary mainly used high minded but meaningless words european commission vice president valdis dombrovskis for example tweeted being part of the euro means being part of a common journey european nations will be stronger if they travel together european central bank president mario draghi attempted a more considered but nevertheless cheery economic scorecard to convey cheer he repeated worn storylines and disregarded mounting contrary evidence the single market needs a single currency no it does not draghi s central theme is that monetary union was a necessary consequence of the single market he leans on the authority of nobel laureate robert mundell who asserted that uncertainty in exchange rate movements constituted a barrier to trade to that draghi adds and the single currency has further enhanced the process by eliminating the costs of foreign exchange payments and settlements and of hedging exchange rate risk the earliest and for long the most influential econometric analysis cited in support of the proposition that exchange rate uncertainty and costs of transacting across currencies hampered trade was a 1989 study by two italian economists francesco giavazzi and alberto giovannini in fact the authors found that uncertain exchange rate movements and transactions costs made no difference to the volume of international trade yet giavazzi and giovannini were committed to the proposition they had set out to prove and they asserted that europe s exceptional economic and political characteristics required fixed exchange rates the giavazzi giovannini empirical finding as distinct from their preferred conclusion would not have been a surprise to otmar emminger president of germany s bundesbank who had noted some years earlier that exporters routinely and inexpensively hedged against foreign currency risk in 1993 in a now classic journal of literature article on the proposed monetary union the university of california berkeley economist barry eichengreen challenged those who claimed that transactions costs of converting currencies limited international trade fast forward to today here is the evidence germany s trade within the european union has grown most rapidly with three non euro countries the czech republic hungary and poland it is only a matter of time before germany s trade with these countries exceeds the sum of trade with france and italy the two largest eurozone countries after germany so no a single market does not need a single currency figure 1 german exporters have shifted their sights away from the euro area percent of total german exports to the various countries source imf data draghi repeats the persistent european mantra that the risk of continuing devaluation of the italian lira would have deterred german exports to italy well the evidence is in the euro fixed the lira s value vis à vis the d mark and german exporters lost interest in the italian market regardless draghi further claims that value added chains the dispersal of intermediate production steps across countries requires a single currency yet value added chains are most extensive with the three non euro countries with whom german trade has grown most rapidly defenders of the monetary union may nevertheless argue that trade with non eurozone countries has increased because those countries are growing rapidly and absent the euro trade between member countries would have fallen even faster briefly andrew rose of the university of california berkeley in collaboration with other scholars created a flutter by claiming that european monetary union would create an explosion of trade within member countries of the eurozone but rose s econometric evidence did not pass the smell test as the then federal reserve board governor ben bernanke pointed out in 2004 at the fifth anniversary stocktaking of the euro bernanke noted that the share of trade within the eurozone countries was declining rather than increasing to him that was sufficient reason to worry that rose s estimates were not credible in a sophisticated econometric analysis reported in 2010 joão santos silva and silvana tenreyro noted that countries that had joined the euro area had long had strong historical trade ties with one another once these ties were accounted for the euro s influence on trade between member countries was essentially zero later rose himself in a 2015 mea culpa acknowledged that his earlier studies improperly extrapolated from the trade gains achieved within other currency unions to the likelihood that the eurozone would also experience a within member states trade upsurge with nearly 15 years of eurozone functioning rose concluded that the data were a fog making any definitive statement impossible he conceded however that the euro had a mildly stimulating effect at best in 2018 two new studies lifted that fog by completing the econometric task that rose had left unfinished the first used exactly the same extended data that rose employed and advancing the superior santos silva and tenreyro techniques a superiority that rose himself has acknowledged this study established more firmly than before that the euro had zero influence on trade more remarkably another study ungated working paper again using the santos silva and tenreyro method finds that neither the original eurozone members nor the more recent members trade more with each other just because they share the euro projecting into the future the authors conclude that the euro will not enhance trade for additional members either their blunt conclusion possibly the euro generates some political and economic benefits but we do not believe that increased trade integration with the eurozone should be considered one of them draghi s position has evolved in a november 2013 speech he unaccountably said the empirical evidence suggests that sharing a currency has indeed boosted trade there was no basis for such a statement then the evolution in the shares of trade was clear and the santos silva and tenreyro study was state of the art now in his 20th anniversary retrospective draghi has steered away from making an obviously incorrect claim instead he has retreated to a hazy view that the euro protects the single market draghi s latest assertion whatever it means has no support either in the trends in the direction of trade or in the continuing econometric evidence monetary sovereignty creates more problems than it solves draghi says is that so if euro area countries could set their own monetary policy they would only abuse that autonomy they would run large fiscal deficits and misuse the central bank to finance those deficits so draghi concludes based on behavior of national authorities during the 1970s and 1980s such damaging behavior he believes would have inevitably continued the 1970s and 1980s were exceptional decades during which irresponsible fiscal and monetary policies were common worldwide in part governments were responding to the two oil price hikes which raised inflation rates alongside a sharp slowdown in growth that macro outcome popularly described as stagflation proved a policy challenge everywhere widespread public discontent led to political pressures for government handouts which widened budget deficits and encouraged monetary financing of the deficits western nations that did not adopt a single currency learned to discipline themselves the learning occurred at different times over the course of the 1990s and early 2000s in the united states fed chairman paul volcker in a forceful show of central bank independence raised interest rates to draconian levels in the early 1980s inflation fell and remained relatively low through the subsequent era of the great moderation in europe the u k was the first to make a major break from the stranglehold of fixed exchange rates on black wednesday september 16 1992 speculators forced the sterling out of the bands specified under the exchange rate mechanism erm designed as a precursor to the single currency but the ignominy of being forced out of the erm proved to be a blessing in disguise in steps the british government gave increasingly greater independence to the bank of england which managed monetary affairs with much success and britain experienced golden years of growth with stability other european countries went through their own macroeconomic and financial travails but also moved to independent central banks with inflation targeting mandates sweden at the high end of the economic ladder and poland at the lower end were among the countries that successfully made this transition in france during the debate on ratification of the maastricht treaty to adopt the single currency the conservative politician philippe séguin led the opposition making the case for retaining the franc managed by an independent central bank that would keep inflation under control séguin lost his bid to change the course of french and european history by a whisker but just because france and other european countries adopted the euro officials such as draghi do not have license to keep alive a blinkered and patronizing view that today s eurozone nations would not have achieved the macroeconomic discipline that the swedes and poles did indeed the political economists jesús fernández villaverde luis garicano and tano santos have argued the opposite the euro weakened macroeconomic discipline a common monetary policy for the eurozone brought interest rates down too quickly for countries with weak institutional structures governments in these countries took advantage of the lower interest rates to increase fiscal entitlements for politically favored groups rather than engaging in the harder business of investing to raise their potential growth rates far from instilling discipline the single currency subverted it draghi puzzlingly does not consider the most important benefit of monetary sovereignty the ability to absorb large economic shocks through exchange rate depreciations while continuous devaluations to compensate for lack of productivity growth is a path to economic decline depreciation to absorb shocks is unequivocally desirable moreover to the extent that exchange rate depreciation shortens the period of distress following the shock it also helps avoid drawn out recessions which recent research emphasizes undermine long term growth potential a common agricultural policy required monetary union no it did not draghi uses europe s appalling common agricultural policy as justification for the single currency absent a single currency he says the promised compensation to farmers needed adjustment whenever exchange rates changed those price adjustments draghi melodramatically claims jeopardised trust in the market and poisoned intra community relations first the rendition of history is at the very least controversial andre szász the former dutch central banker is his brilliant little book in 1999 on the european monetary union s history dismissed this as a consideration that european leaders used for introducing the single currency the european bureaucracy used well understood formulas szász reported to make needed price adjustments but the deeper problem with europe s agricultural policy as an argument for a single currency is that the policy itself was so egregious the subsidies soaked up large amounts of the scarce european budget favored larger farmers over smaller farmers and protected inefficient farming in europe when european farmers dumped their large surpluses on world markets they lowered world prices which hurt farmers from developing nations european agricultural policy never had any redeeming feature and was a creature only of a dysfunctional domestic political economic bargain to claim then that an incomplete monetary union with its known risks was required to preserve europe s murky agricultural bargain is another case of dredging for reasons to justify ex post the creation of the monetary union the eurozone promotes economic convergence no it does not the euro s founding fathers were right draghi says in their belief that the single currency s culture of stability would promote higher growth and employment a valuable manifestation of such gains he postulates would be convergence the narrowing of per capita income differences between member countries of the eurozone draghi acknowledges that portugal and greece oddly he does not mention italy have stagnated and so diverged rather than converged yet in defense of the convergence thesis he points to the baltic countries and slovakia as successes such casual use of evidence is deeply problematic slovakia joined the eurozone in 2009 estonia in 2011 latvia in 2014 and lithuania in 2015 they were on an impressive convergence path well before they adopted the euro as documented here and here they converged for reasons well established in traditional growth theory and empirical findings their strong inheritance of human capital from years under socialist planning their transition to market economies and especially after they joined the european union in 2004 reinforcement of rule of law and protection of private property primed them for economic convergence if the argument is that the prospect of eventually entering the eurozone and the fixed exchange rate regime these countries worked under in prior years added to the pace of convergence there simply is no evidence for that other countries that did not join the eurozone and apparently have no near term plans for doing so the czech republic hungary and poland have also converged towards living standards in higher income european economies the contrary argument that a single currency increases divergence rather than promoting convergence goes back to british economists nicholas kaldor and alan walters both noted that a single monetary policy would be too tight for the weaker country further weakening short term growth prospects the same monetary policy will spur higher growth in the stronger country the evidence is consistent with this more pessimistic view once the global financial crisis began the one size that fits none monetary policy clearly increased economic divergence as i document the single market is europe s great achievement yes but don t idealize it i believe in the virtues of the single market they are not as grand as touted but they are real unfortunately draghi makes absurd claims the single market was designed to reap the benefits of openness while also tempering its costs for the most vulnerable to promote growth while protecting the people of europe from the injustices of untrammelled free markets whatever the social protections in european legislation the most vulnerable in germany france and italy have lost their manufacturing jobs to or seen their wages deeply compressed by east european workers controversy has also swirled around posted workers the signature symbol of a single market in services such workers the fabled polish plumber bricklayers and truck drivers are typically posted by their eastern european employers in the richer european countries french president emmanuel macron describe posted workers as a form of social dumping because they receive benefits in line with the lower eastern european standards macron lobbied for and succeeded in imposing more constraints on posted workers and draghi applauds that achievement as a worthy effort to curtail unfair labour practices that is not the view of eastern european governments who insist that the new directives curtail free trade in services the truth is that under the gloss of protecting labor rights european governments have been pursuing the creation of flexible labor markets the word flexible being a euphemism for making it easier to fire workers yes employment has increased because workers are forced to accept temporary jobs at lower wages to the realist such an outcome merely reflects the more efficient working of the market economy yet temporary work contracts are associated with lower productivity hence lower wages provide no boost in competitiveness meanwhile the underbelly of vast numbers of monthly even daily and hourly contracts creates unsustainable social anxiety the consequences of a false narrative can be dire the nobel laureates george akerlof and robert shiller highlight the crucial role stories play in determining economic policies and outcomes repeated endlessly the stories we tell ourselves become our motivating force impelling us to ignore contrary evidence as shiller more dramatically says because a story is an easily expressed explanation of events it sometimes propagates like a disease it can go viral as it spreads he warns the story has an economic impact often a more dire political impact he may well have added for the 10th anniversary celebration in june 2008 former ecb president jean claude trichet gushed that the euro had been extraordinarily successful this at a moment when the eurozone was already experiencing gale force winds describing trichet s speech i paraphrased george orwell in my book eurotragedy a drama in nine acts trichet i wrote was narrating the history of the euro as it ought to have been rather than how it was draghi is more careful in his 20th anniversary speech he acknowledges that the eurozone remains an incomplete monetary union with its attendant risks however draghi then recites long held but repeatedly refuted myths about the euro s economic virtues and especially in his closing draghi is unable to resist the high minded political rhetoric of his compatriots to describe his desired rather than the actual historical evolution the monetary union he says is the defining symbol of the european political project which unites europeans in freedom peace democracy and prosperity such gloss only serves to undermine credibility especially since european nations are more divided than at any time since world war ii and the euro has contributed greatly to deepening euroskepticism monetary union draghi continues was necessary to end centuries of dictatorships war and misery draghi has so much of his economics wrong it is scary to contemplate the consequences if he has his politics backwards this post written by ashoka mody
with bastien inzaurralde the ticker sen elizabeth warren d mass just dropped a tax policy bombshell that should explode any lingering doubt that her party is veering left on the issue and preparing to make the yawning wealth gap a central focus of the 2020 presidential campaign the proposal word of which was first broken yesterday by my colleagues jeff stein and christopher ingraham would apply a 2 percent annual wealth tax on the net worth of those 75 000 households with more than 50 million in total assets those with more than a billion dollars in assets would face an additional 1 percent tax it would generate 2 75 trillion over a decade according to emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman the university of california at berkeley economists who advised warren on the plan but warren notably is pitching the idea foremost as a means of rebalancing the concentration of wealth a phenomenon she frames as a threat to democracy itself rather than leading with the ambitious programs the new revenue could fund advertisement today in america the top one tenth of 1 percent has amassed about as much wealth as 90 percent of america upper middle class middle class working class working poor and the poor poor warren said in an interview last night on msnbc s all in with chris hayes and the consequence of having amassed that much wealth is bad for our economy a tiny group of people making decisions that always tend to favor a lot of big corporations and bad for our democracy because it means just like you hear it s now a democracy that is influenced by the wealthy the well connected and it s not working for the people the ultra rich have rigged our economy rigged our tax rules we need structural change that s why i m proposing something brand new an annual wealth tax on the tippy top 0 1 we d get 3 trillion in new revenue to invest in rebuilding the middle class let s make it happen pic twitter com b0imistxez elizabeth warren ewarren january 25 2019 it was no accident that warren unveiled the plan as the globe s wealthiest and most powerful gathered this week in davos for the world economic forum a conclave that has become totemic of the billionaire class s world bending influence a dozen davos attendees including financiers jamie dimon and stephen schwarzman have seen their fortunes surge by a combined 175 billion even as median u s household wealth has stagnated a bloomberg analysis found and ubs and pwc billionaires insights reports show that global billionaire wealth has grown from 3 4 trillion in 2009 to 8 9 trillion in 2017 but the rollout also happened to land on a day that featured two members of trump s administration with wall street pedigrees sounding particularly out of touch when it comes to the struggles of federal workers missing paychecks during the neverending shutdown advertisement warren in the msnbc interview talked up the promise of paying for universal child care student debt relief clean energy projects and expanding health care but she circled back to her point that the proposal is about basic fairness it also underscores her position as a policymaking pacesetter in the 2020 democratic field rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y kick started a debate within the party over how hard to push for higher taxes on the super rich when she floated a 70 percent top marginal rate on income over 10 million warren is the first presidential hopeful to follow up with a fleshed out plan one that will force the still evolving field to respond in kind warren said she s aware those facing the tax will attempt to minimize their exposure to it she is proposing three enforcement mechanisms those are a significant increase in funding for the internal revenue service a mandatory audit rate requiring a certain number of people who pay the wealth tax to be subject to an audit every year and a one time tax penalty for those who have more than 50 million and try to renounce their u s citizenship jeff and christopher

sarah rice the washington post still the proposal would face a number of hurdles a wealth tax faces political legal and practical obstacles the wall street journal s richard rubin writes unlike estate and income tax plans wealth taxes don t have a long track record of support in congress even among democrats wealthy taxpayers would begin looking for ways to escape or avoid the tax and there would be frequent disputes about the value of illiquid assets such as businesses real estate and art and taxpayers would consider constitutional challenges pointing to the limits on so called direct taxation advertisement conservatives are criticizing the idea as extreme and unworkable capital investment has to be financed by savings says alan viard a former federal reserve economist now at the american enterprise institute over the long haul there would be a negative impact on investment and the growth of the economy adam michel a tax policy analyst at the heritage foundation said warren s proposal really comes down to the politics of envy and whether or not we should be increasing taxes on the wealthy more than they already are conservative critics of higher taxes on the wealthy cite the disproportionate share of overall tax revenue they contribute but economists supporting warren s proposal looked at the relative tax burdens another way the wealthiest 1 percent of families currently face a total tax burden including state and local taxes of about 3 2 percent relative to wealth they note per the post the bottom 99 percent of families currently has a tax burden of 7 2 percent relative to their wealth the economists say polling shows strong public support for hiking taxes on the ultra rich a reuters ipsos survey taken during the congressional debate over the tax code in the fall of 2017 for example found 53 percent of adults strongly agree the wealthiest should pay higher taxes and another 23 percent somewhat agree with that proposition an earlier pew research center study found 60 percent of poll respondents believe the wealthy don t pay their fair share of taxes advertisement and one person close to warren notes those attitudes are remarkably stable over the last quarter century gallup polls since 1992 show americans believe the wealthy pay too little in taxes by an average margin of 42 percent with the margin never dipping below 29 points according to this source but the politics of the issue are trickier for republicans who split along income lines higher earning republicans are far more likely to criticize the complexity of the code and the amount of taxes they pay than to complain about the conduct of corporations and wealthy individuals according to bill galston of brookings economic class makes a big difference for republicans but very little for democrats upper income democrats are just as likely as middle and lower income democrats to believe that some corporations and wealthy individuals are shirking their responsibility to help fund the government advertisement the democratic policymaking elite have been arguably slow to reflect that consensus but developments over the course of the last several weeks suggest that may be changing ocasio cortez s idea received wide backing and some more traditionally establishment figures are already declaring support for warren s proposal from gene sperling who chaired the national economic council in the obama administration wealth inequality in our nation is a national scandal this type of wealth tax that senwarren is proposing is essential it frees up dramatic

overview of the chinese economy china is one of the largest economies in the world second only to the united states as of 2018 it had a gross domestic product gdp of 14 092 514 billion 1 despite its size china s economy still has plenty of room to grow before it is officially considered a developed economy morgan stanley capital international msci for example officially lists china as an emerging market em economy because it has a low gdp per capita china reported a gdp per capita figure of 8827 in november 2018 which is remarkably low compared to the us s 59 531 1 however china s reputation as an em could change soon as many foreign policymakers are starting to consider it as a developed market due to its growth rate and increasing global influence what are the biggest industries in china the dominant industries that have propelled china s gdp growth are the services industry which employs the largest portion of china s population roughly 36 and contributes 46 of its gdp 2 the growth of the services market has led to healthy domestic consumption rates and gdp per capita increases which employs the largest portion of china s population roughly 36 and contributes 46 of its gdp the growth of the services market has led to healthy domestic consumption rates and gdp per capita increases the manufacturing industry which makes up about 44 of china s gdp and employs 30 of the

s agricultural output goes toward filling domestic demand but it also exports soft commodities such as rice wheat corn and soybeans although these industries contribute the largest amount to china s gdp there are a variety of other up and coming industries that could be of interest to investors and traders these include biotechnology information technology and alternative energy history of the chinese economy the people s republic of china was founded in 1949 following the chinese communist revolution and demise of the nationalist party although chinese financial markets were closed after the revolution the following two decades saw a lot of growth as the industrialisation of the country was prioritised from the 1970s china gradually reformed its economy from a closed economic system

there are a variety of ways that individuals can gain exposure to chinese assets the most common way is by using financial derivatives cfds these enable you to take a long or a short position on a range of markets such as the chinese currency and stock market so that you can trade periods of growth as well as economic slowdowns how to trade the chinese yuan the currency of china is the renminbi rmb or people s currency while renminbi is the official name it is commonly known as the yuan which is a single unit of the currency it was pegged to the us dollar from 1994 to 2005 at which point it was allowed to trade against a basket of major currencies the people s bank of china pboc have the intention of making it a completely free floating currency in the near future supposedly a lot of china s growth stems from its monetary policies which have kept the yuan undervalued against the dollar and other currencies this led to allegations that the chinese government was manipulating foreign exchange markets by devaluing its currency in an attempt to keep exports cheap and make the economy more competitive the yuan is commonly traded alongside major currencies such as the us dollar usd cnh the british pound gbp cnh and the australian dollar aud cnh if you thought that the chinese economy was entering a period of growth you would sell these currency pairs believing that the yuan would rise against the other currencies whereas if you were more pessimistic about china s growth you might choose to buy these currency pairs with the expectation that they will increase in value learn more about the emerging market currencies to watch how to trade the chinese stock market traders can also gain exposure to the growth of china by speculating on the shares of chinese

zimbabwe s president emmerson mnangagwa has promised action in response to a crackdown by security forces on anti government protesters following a hike in the price of fuel lawyers and activists say police and soldiers have killed at least a dozen people wounded scores and arrested hundreds over the demonstrations zimbabwe s human rights commission zhrc accused security forces of systematic torture critics say the country is reverting to the authoritarian rule that characterised the 37 year regime of former leader robert mugabe who was forced from power after a coup in november 2017 the crisis will not be easy to fix there is a severe shortage of dollars fuel and medicines while inflation hit 42 in december the highest in a decade foreign investors are by and large staying away what sparked the latest clashes everyday life has been getting harder as the price of basic goods spirals in the past two months the country has suffered acute shortages of imported goods including medicines food and fuel motorists can wait for hours to fill up at fuel stations where soldiers are often deployed to break up fights over who is next in line on jan 12 mnangagwa announced to reporters that the price of petrol had increased to 3 31 per litre from 1 32 from midnight but there would be no increase for foreign embassies and tourists paying in cash us dollars it was the final straw for some zimbabweans and violent protests broke out two days after his announcement some residents say that while calm has returned soldiers have continued to beat up civilians many people blame mnangagwa for failing to fulfil his pre election promises to kick start economic growth and make a clean break with the strong arm rule of his predecessor genisis of cash shortages the country abandoned the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 after inflation reached 500 billion percent the year before in its place the government adopted the us dollar and other currencies including sterling and the south african rand people hoped the move would spell the end of spiralling prices and rampant money printing that made much of their earnings and savings virtually worthless but over time supply of the us and south african currencies dried up so in november 2016 authorities in harare launched a surrogate currency paper bond notes designed to ease acute hard currency shortages the notes which now have a total face value of 400 million are backed by a 500 million loan from the african export and import bank the central bank has said they are used like cash officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1 1 on the street 1 fetches up to 3 bond notes reflecting the ongoing shortage of us dollars and people s desire to trade out of cheapening bond notes and into more reliable currency a dwindling supply of bond notes and coins has led to banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as 30 in bond notes companies are struggling to pay for imports and foreign investors cannot repatriate dividends or profits zollars when the bond note was introduced dollar deposits in the electronic banking system started losing their value government borrowing via treasury bills meant authorities were creating money without the backing of sufficient currency reserves or gold it is these electronic dollars theoretically worth 10 billion and nicknamed zollars by economists that are raising fears that zimbabwe might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade zimbabweans can do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments zollars remain officially pegged at 1 1 to the us dollar but on the black market 1 is now worth 4 zollars that has led some businesses to offer discounts on dollar payments zimbabwe s foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks cover for imports central bank data show the government has said it would only consider launching a new currency if it had at least six months of reserves but finance minister mthuli ncube said zimbabwe planned to introduce a new currency in the next 12 months how are businesses affected companies are struggling to import raw materials and equipment forcing them to buy dollars on the black market civil servants are paid in zollars like many other workers across the country only a small minority of employees working for foreign embassies charities or large international corporations are paid in us dollars last october the central bank ordered banks to create separate us dollar accounts for clients who are paid from overseas which analysts said was a tacit admission by authorities that the greenback was not equal to the zollar the confederation of zimbabwe industries has warned that some of its members could stop operating by the end of the month due to the dollar crunch the group said its members had a backlog of 480 million in unpaid payments to foreign suppliers cooking oil and soap maker olivine industries said on saturday it had suspended production and put workers on indefinite leave because it owed foreign suppliers 11 million zimbabwe s largest brewing company delta beverages part owned by anheuser busch inbev said it had abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments rather than zollars for its beer and soft drinks after the government intervened what s next mnangagwa a former spy chief installed after mugabe s removal in a coup in november 2017 was elected in july amid hopes that he would help secure an economic turnaround for zimbabwe and has said his nation is open for business but critics say the man nicknamed the crocodile is moving too slowly on economic and political reforms including repealing mugabe era laws that restrict the media mnangagwa has also called for the lifting of us sanctions against officials from the zanu pf ruling party top military figures and some government owned firms which were imposed during mugabe s rule for what washington called violations of human rights and democracy the imf has said it would be difficult for the fund to support the country s reform programme unless its 2 billion arrears with the world bank african development bank and european investment bank are paid harare says that should be done in the next 12 months and plans a programme allowing the imf to monitor its economic reforms although it does not entail funding from the lender analysts said the ongoing security crackdown could quell the protests for now but more clashes were expected unless mnangagwa s administration could find a solution to the cash shortages
week beginning 28 january 2019 australia cpi private credit trade prices corelogic home prices australia day nz trade balance auckland anniversary day china nbs and caixin pmi s euro area cpi gdp unemployment ecb president draghi speaks uk boe governor carney speaks us fomc meeting non farm payrolls gdp and pce releases likely to be delayed due to shutdown key economic financial forecasts information contained in this report current as at 25 january 2019 why the rba will keep rates on hold next fed hike delayed to june due to shutdown after the usual summer recess the reserve bank will conduct its board meeting on february 5 followed by a speech from governor lowe on february 6 and the february statement on monetary policy which will print on february 8 of course there will be no rate change following the board meeting but there will be considerable interest in the governor s statement and the subsequent communications recall that the minutes of board meetings have usually contained words along the lines of members continued to agree that the next move in the cash rate was more likely to be an increase rather than a decrease alternatively the november statement on monetary policy noted further reducing unemployment and ensuring inflation is consistent with the target if that progress is made higher interest rates are likely to be appropriate at some point but those sentiments were expressed when markets had been anticipating rate hikes at the beginning of 2018 when westpac was predicting the cash rate would remain on hold in both 2018 and 2019 markets had priced in a full 25bps rate hike by end 2018 today markets are assessing that the next move in the cash rate will be down by 25 basis points with a probability of 60 13bps by year s end in defence of the economists only 11 of the 20 forecasters bloomberg survey january 12 2018 predicted a hike or hikes in 2018 but this group did include the other three major banks amp and most major investment banks there is no survey evidence to check how many of the nochange nine supported the westpac view that rates would remain on hold through 2019 as well there is also at this stage little support from the economists for the market view that rates will be cut by end 2019 since that survey in january last year westpac has extended its on hold view through 2020 the key as to whether the reserve bank will placate markets and adopt a pure neutral bias by eliminating the next move up in its commentary will hinge on how it reassesses its forecasts which will be released with the february statement on monetary policy which prints on february 8 recall that based on its forecasts in the november somp the conclusion that the cash rate would eventually rise was reasonable growth was forecast at 3 5 in 2018 3 25 in 2019 and 3 in 2020 trend growth is assessed by the rba as 2 75 1 ppt for productivity growth and 1 75 ppt s for labour force growth three consecutive years of comfortably above trend growth could be expected to erode significant excess capacity and boost employment growth so that inflation would lift into the 2 3 target range and the unemployment rate would approach the nairu accordingly the bank forecast core inflation to lift to 2 25 in 2019 and 2020 and the unemployment rate to fall to 4 75 by end 2020 their views on the labour market have been cautious the unemployment rate has already reached 5 while the wage price index growth rate has lifted in recent quarters to 2 3 scrutiny of a chart which for the first time was provided in the november somp points to a cautious forecast of wpi annual growth reaching 2 ½ per cent by end 2020 but the september quarter gdp report has disrupted the rba s comfortable position with growth only printing 0 3 in that quarter it would be necessary for q4 to print 1 2 to achieve the november forecast of 3 5 the 2018 growth forecast is likely to be lowered from 3 5 to 3 0 but what will this mean for the 2019 and 2020 growth forecasts we know that the bank has assessed a minimal wealth effect on consumption and the q3 growth report is unlikely to have changed that view even further negative evidence on house prices in sydney and melbourne is unlikely to change the qualitative assessment that the wealth effect was minimal while house prices were booming and therefore will be minimal in reverse westpac differs in that regard pointing to a fall in the savings rates in nsw and victoria over the year to september 2018 of 1 7 ppt s we expect some reversal of that effect in 2019 and 2020 pushing growth in consumer spending down from our previous forecast of 2 6 in each year to 2 4 we expect the bank will maintain its current view that consumer spending will run at a growth rate of 3 in both 2019 and 2010 we also differ on the likely downtrend in residential construction in 2019 and to a lesser extent in 2020 dwelling investment has remained high and should remain at a high level for the next year or so nov somp westpac s growth forecasts are 2 6 in 2019 and 2 6 in 2020 those forecasts are only slightly below trend and consistent with steady rates in 2019 and 2020 we expect the rba will forecast growth of 3 in 2019 and 3 in 2020 that higher growth will reflect a limited slowdown in housing construction and no meaningful wealth effect those growth forecasts are still above trend and likely to ensure the view that the next move in rates will be up if we thought the rba was likely to lower its growth forecasts in 2019 and 2020 to 2 5 or less then we would certainly expect it to adopt an easing bias if a central bank expects below trend growth particularly in the policy year which in 2019 will be 2020 then we would expect an easing bias other factors which may impact market thinking are the higher recent levels of bbsw and associated out of cycle hikes by some banks the rba will probably view those developments as likely to exacerbate housing price weakness but due to an insignificant wealth effect will unlikely materially change their forecasts in regards to the us we now expect the fomc to remain on hold due to the government shutdown but continue hiking in june and september readers will be aware that our forecast for fomc policy had been three more rate hikes in march june and september equity market volatility has undoubtedly unnerved the fomc s p 500 down 20 by late december from its previous peak followed by a 12 5 rally to date but more importantly the government shutdown has impacted confidence and data availability under such a cloud of uncertainty there is little prospect for the fomc to change rates much before mid year accordingly we do not expect the next fomc rate hike until the june meeting this year we do expect a follow up move in september retaining our original timetable for the federal funds rate to peak in september 2019 we maintain our core view that the us economy remains strong largely through a robust consumer boosted by rising wages and strong jobs growth we do not expect to see a marked slowdown in jobs growth and consumer spending until the september quarter as with our views for australia we are out of step with current market pricing which largely expects us rates to now be on hold the week that was this week the heat remained in australia s labour market but dissipated further in china s economy for brexit and the us shutdown a resolution remains out of reach starting with australia s labour market employment growth again came in above expectations in december with almost 22k new positions created in the month at 2 2 yr annual growth has cooled markedly over 2018 from a peak of 3 6 yr at january however it remains well in excess of population growth keeping pressure on the unemployment rate currently 5 0 victoria remains the strongest of the states their unemployment rate having fallen 1 1ppts in 2018 to 4 4 to be on par with nsw the other states have rates nearer 6 looking ahead we expect a moderation in job gains on the back of softer household demand and uncertainty around the federal election that shift is likely to see the unemployment rate drift up to 5 3 around mid 2019 before moving on to the northern hemisphere it is worth noting that new zealand reported q4 inflation this week the result highlighted an interesting tension for the rbnz with tradable goods prices taking the heat out of headline inflation in the quarter 0 1 in the quarter as tradeable prices fell 0 4 while annual inflation remained just below the rbnz s 2 0 yr target band mid point at 1 9 yr supported by the underlying trend in non tradeable domestic inflation our new zealand team expects that the underlying inflation pulse will gradually strengthen hence it will be some time before the rbnz have to consider reacting next wednesday sees the release of australia s q4 cpi our preview emphasises that another soft outcome is expected a 0 3 quarterly gain for both headline and core inflation for an annual pace near 1 5 yr as in new zealand external price pressures are weak in australia 1 1 yr however here domestic pressures are more subdued 1 8 yr thanks in no small part to weak housing inflation turning to china the headlines surrounding q4 gdp marked the update as unquestionably weak and cause for concern given annual growth came in at its weakest pace since the gfc 6 4 yr pessimism is understandable but not well founded first and foremost this outcome comes after a very deliberate and purposeful policy shift by the central government to improve the quality of growth and guarantee long term financial stability this is the primary factor behind the softer growth of 2018 not trade tensions more sustainable higher productivity growth is most certainly in china s long term interest second with the economy now more focused on quality chinese authorities are beginning to become more pro active on growth particularly investment in infrastructure there is therefore a strong likelihood of the 6 0 annualised growth of q4 being a near term floor for gdp this does not mean that growth in china will take off however the focus on quality will remain in place and as per the most recent credit data and policy actions support for growth from credit provision will only build slowly essential to china s longterm prosperity is that new loans made to firms and households are based on strong standards and further that markets and household wealth are stewarded well finally to the north atlantic headlines regarding brexit and the us shutdown continue to pile up but progress towards a resolution is non existent indeed if anything it seems the political malaise surrounding both issues is getting worse it is little wonder then that such concern was shown by the world s political and business leaders towards the outlook at the davos world economic forum ahead of which the imf cut its global growth forecasts the one policy event of note this week was the ecb s january meeting having balanced belief in the real economy and concern over the risks in recent engagements in this instance the focus shifted more towards the risks which have moved to the downside no change in forward guidance on rates has been seen yet but is likely in march if current trends and or uncertainties persist with rate hikes the deposit rate likely off the agenda until the december meeting at least looking ahead next week should bring some positive headlines on trade with high level us china trade talks due in washington the fomc s january meeting will also be a focus on the other political matters however low expectations are probably best chart of the week australia employment employment ended 2018 with a sound run in the year to december total employment grew 268 6k or 2 2 while it is true that the momentum in the australian labour market eased through 2018 annual growth peaked at 3 6 yr in january it can still be described as sound given the december gain in employment it is not surprising that the unemployment rate eased back 0 1ppt to 5 0 market median was for 5 1 this fall was helped by a 0 1ppt moderation in the participation rate to 65 6 which limited the rise in the labour force to just 7 5k for 2019 we are looking for a pause in the pace in employment growth due to the economic uncertainties surrounding the federal election at the same time as we expect to see a moderation in momentum in nsw and victoria on the back of a moderation in housing activity we are expecting this to slow employment growth to below the pace of growth in the labour force lifting the unemployment rate to 5 3 around mid 2019 new zealand week ahead data wrap middle ground inflation in new zealand is now settling into the middle of the reserve bank s target range after years of underperforming we re forecasting a lift in domestically generated inflation over the next few years but it will be a gradual process and there are some potential stumbling blocks along the way the consumer price index for the december quarter was up by 1 9 on a year earlier putting it close to the midpoint of the reserve bank s 1 3 target range the various core inflation measures also sat around 2 or a little below indicating that this was a broad based result with no obvious distortions from temporary factors the december quarter itself saw a 0 1 increase slightly below the rbnz s forecast of a 0 2 rise however that hides some important detail at the time the rbnz was preparing the forecasts for its november monetary policy statement fuel prices had rocketed up to new record highs on the back of rising world oil prices a lower exchange rate and an increase in the fuel excise duty but fuel prices then fell surprisingly sharply into the yearend taking some of the heat out of the overall inflation rate this will also act to dampen inflation in the early part of 2019 but it s a temporary influence that the rbnz can look through in contrast prices for non tradable goods and services were up 2 7 on a year ago the fastest increase since june 2014 compared to the rbnz s forecast of a slowdown to 2 4 that difference is important because non tradables inflation tends to be more persistent over time and because it s considered to be more of a product of monetary policy settings for much of this decade inflation has been at the low end or even below the rbnz s 1 3 target range that era of uncomfortably low inflation now seems to have passed the next question is whether inflation could test the upper end of the target range given that monetary policy remains very stimulatory we re expecting a gradual pick up in inflation pressures over the next few years but there are a few hurdles that need to be crossed yet firstly a pickup in inflation will depend on continued solid growth in demand we expect gdp to grow by around 3 over this year with support from increased government spending export earnings and construction recent data both here and overseas has been on the softer side of expectations so we ll be watching the numbers closely to get a clearer picture of the economy s momentum tradables prices have been a persistent drag on overall inflation in past years notwithstanding the recent bounce in world oil prices more recently there have been signs of a mild pick up or a slower rate of decline in tradables inflation reflecting the lower new zealand dollar over the last year we re expecting a further fall in the exchange rate this year which would flow through into prices for imported goods but this doesn t have a sustained impact on the rate of inflation to get a sustained rise it needs to come from domestic sources most importantly a pickup in wage growth there s a lot of evidence that the labour market is becoming tighter the unemployment rate is at its lowest in a decade and increasingly employers are having difficulty in finding workers to date we haven t seen that translate into faster wage growth outside of government mandated increases such as fair pay settlements and minimum wage hikes it may be that the labour market has only recently moved into territory that could be considered tight by historic standards and that wage growth tends to have a lagging relationship with the economic cycle moreover wage growth as measured by the labour cost index which adjusts for changes in job composition and productivity gains tends to evolve quite slowly it could be some time before a pickup in the pace of wage growth becomes apparent in the data nevertheless we think the right conditions are in place for a pickup over the next few years one final challenge to our view is that some of the most important components of non tradables inflation may have already peaked prices for new home builds which make up over 5 of the cpi have slowed in the last year or so in line with the slowdown in growth in house sales prices with a range of government policies aimed at dampening speculative demand in the housing market we expect prices for both existing and new homes to remain under pressure over the next few years the outlook for rents which make up almost 10 of the cpi is less clear there has been very little variation in rental growth at the national level in recent years but the regional split is more telling rental growth is actually slowing in auckland even as it picks up in other parts of the country the bottom line is that any pickup in home grown inflation is likely to be a slow one and it will be some time before the rbnz needs to act to contain it we re expecting the official cash rate to remain at its current very low level through to the end of next year with rate hikes progressing at a very gradual pace from then on on a different note this week we saw the first release of the net migration figures based on a new methodology which uses actual outcomes 16 months after someone has entered or left the country rather than their stated intentions on departure cards this produces a somewhat different picture of migration over history net inflows peaked slightly earlier and at a lower level than under the previous method however it remains the case that net migration is in decline which is a key reason why we expect the economy s potential growth to take a step down over the next few years data previews aus q4 consumer price index jan 30 last 0

and their confidence in the us real economy diminishes every day that the federal government keeps its doors shut fomc officials have focused on global risks to date while these factors will remain front of mind a more in depth discussion of the shutdown s impact is anticipated with many partial data prints unavailable a march hike is clearly off the agenda the market will therefore focus on

print of dec with an additional 58k in back revisions to the prior two months was largely ignored by financial markets this occurred because around the same time the ism s disappointed and more importantly fed chair powell put forward a more cautious view of the outlook there is no reason to disregard the strength of this data print though being 100k over the month average of 2018 there is however reason to expect some payback in jan we consequently look for a 150k gain in the month there has been considerable uncertainty over the impact of the shutdown on these numbers it won t affect the payrolls count but it is likely to add to unemployment owing to temporary layoffs
what if i told you that the government can always spend as much money as it wants because it can always print as much money as it needs you d probably say that that s all well and good but it doesn t exactly sound like the best way to run an economy just ask zimbabwe which followed this philosophy if you want to call it that until prices there were eventually doubling nearly every day in the second worst hyperinflation in history for a new generation of democrats though this is a much more remote concern than the lived experience of the past 10 years when the issue has very much been that the government has spent too little rather than too much not to mention that they are tired of being asked how they re going to pay for things like a green new deal or medicare for all when say increased defense spending or tax cuts for the rich never seem to receive the same kind of scrutiny and so some of them like freshman rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y now seem willing to entertain this notion which goes by the name of modern monetary theory or mmt that we should stop worrying about deficits in part because of the government s ability to print money advertisement it s a useful idea if you don t take it too far but a dangerous one if you do that s because it only works as long as you don t consciously try it what do i mean by that well it turns out that there are more and less responsible ways to print money all you have to do is look at japan and venezuela to see that indeed while their policies have seemed the same both have run fairly sizable deficits at the same time that they have printed quite a bit of money their outcomes could not have been more different inflation isn t even 1 percent in japan while our best guess is that it s around 80 000 percent in venezuela the important thing to understand here is that how you print money matters more than how much you print japan for its part has a mostly independent central bank that has made clear it is printing money not because the government needs it to but rather because the economy does in other words it is not trying to bail out a government that is spending too much but stimulate an economy that isn t spending enough to that end it has announced in advance how much money it will print at one time under what conditions it will continue to do so and precisely what it will use all this money for advertisement this has reassured investors that what seems like the most reckless thing possible cranking the printing presses is being done with all the care and sobriety you would expect of an institution that has been tasked with safeguarding price stability the result has been the closest thing there is to a free lunch in economics japan really has been able to pay for some of its spending without having to increase its taxes increase its borrowing or suffer increased inflation it s the holy grail of mmt supporters share this article share which would make venezuela their poisoned chalice its problem is simple venezuela s central bank is subservient to a bankrupt state so it s printing money not out of economic necessity but political desperation and not even ordinary levels of it either more like world historical venezuela you see never had an economy so much as an oil exporting business that subsidized everything else even that though never worked as well as it should have because the chavista regime made those subsidies bigger than it could afford even when oil prices were high which is to say that it really doesn t work now that crude prices are so low that s why there has been no limit to how much money it has printed or how much value its currency has lost in fact it s down more than 99 999 percent going by black market rates since the start of 2012 advertisement here s why his matters mmt thinks that it can get better results than japan has by using slightly more responsible methods than venezuela has specifically it would make the federal reserve permanently keep interest rates at zero to make it easier for the government to afford more spending and even print money if necessary to pay for things so why wouldn t this potentially unlimited money printing turn into hyperinflation like it has in other places because mmt supporters say the government would increase taxes at the first sign that prices were beginning to rise any faster the idea being that this would suck enough dollars out of the economy to make up for all the ones that were being created it s a complete inversion of the way things normally work where fiscal policy is primarily about funding the government and monetary policy is about keeping inflation under control but as new york magazine s josh barro points out there s every reason to think that this would fail practically speaking while it s true that the fed has been slow to do the right things the last 10 years congress has more often than not done the wrong things it s a problem of perverse incentives with the parties so polarized there s no reason one would help the other when it controls the white house and so we ve seen republicans in congress do the exact opposite of what textbook economics would tell you trying to cut the deficit when unemployment was high under president barack obama but expanding it when unemployment was low under president trump advertisement the idea then that fiscal policymakers would ever be able to overcome all of these conflicts that come with having so many veto points in the process and do a good job of stabilizing the economy all by themselves is simply a fantasy and even if they could do you really think politicians who have a hard enough time raising taxes to pay for popular programs would do so to stop inflation from going up but for everything mmt gets wrong it does get one big thing right mainstream economists have spent too much time worrying about hypothetical debt and inflation problems and not enough time worrying about actual unemployment ones so in that sense it s a welcome corrective and one that s starting to make some headway no less an authority after all than former international monetary fund director olivier blanchard has recently said that higher debt levels might not cost us as much as we thought and the federal reserve has admitted that the trade off between lower unemployment and higher inflation is so small right now that it can afford to raise rates at a much more measured pace than it had assumed if this ends up being mmt s sole legacy it will be a very good one but if instead as its most enthusiastic supporters are wont to do it becomes an excuse to say that there s as much free money as we want to pay for as much government as we want well it will be the opposite that s because these benefits being able to sustain bigger deficits and lower interest rates are only available if you act like there is some limit to them if you don t it will change how people respond to what you re doing and they will disappear which is just another way of saying that expectations matter

global growth concerns are complicating chinese policymakers efforts to stabilise its economy said andrew tilton chief asia pacific economist at goldman sachs as beijing embarked on a new round of stimulus it will be increasingly tricky for beijing to calibrate the right dosage of stimulus to prevent a sharp economic slowdown this year tilton told an event in hong kong this week tilton said there is a danger that chinese policymakers could underestimate the size of the risk and not offer enough stimulus particularly as it looks to deal with sluggish demand in key export markets if growth is slowing globally china is facing a less friendly external environment in terms of being able to export a lot and if growth is slowing domestically as well then you may need to do more to stabilise growth than what has been done so far tilton said the risk is you are doing too little he said on january 23 the ministry of finance said it will increase spending plan for large scale tax cuts and reduce social security fees paid by employers in a bid to shore up confidence in the economy which grew at 6 6 per cent last year the lowest pace for 28 years on the same day the people s bank of china pboc china s central bank injected 257 5 billion yuan us 37 9 billion into the banking system for the first time using its targeted medium term lending facility to increase loans to struggling firms loans from the new facility carry a lower interest rate than other pboc lending vehicles and banks can take three years to repay them beijing must however tread a fine line between easing fiscal and monetary policies further this year and avoiding the sort of flood like stimulus that was used to combat economic downturns in the past chinese officials have repeatedly warned against fuelling risky levels of debt via local government financing vehicles and in the property sector japanese lender mufg bank estimates that china s debt to gdp ratio is more than 300 per cent including debt that is unreported to official authorities so far beijing has refrained from broad based loosening of funds and has shied away from benchmark interest rate cuts but it had implemented a raft of other policy measures before wednesday s announcements these include four rounds of reserve requirement ratio cuts to boost lending along with tax breaks and infrastructure spend the challenge is complicated by a slowing world economy with the international monetary fund slashing its global growth forecast for 2019 from 3 7 per cent to 3 5 per cent a fundamental slowdown in the us economy is underway said jan hatzius chief economist at goldman sachs speaking at the same event despite the ongoing trade war the us remains china s biggest trading partner by some distance hatzius said that lower us equity prices are helping to tighten financial conditions and putting a squeeze on the us economy measures of financial conditions typically factor in long term bond yields corporate borrowing rates currency fluctuations and share prices these are under stress largely due to the stock market slump hatzius said the dow jones industrial average a stock market index that tracks the value of 30 large publicly owned us companies has lost 24 per cent since its peak in october 2018 pushing it into bear market territory the s p 500 which tracks america s 500 biggest stocks is down 10 per cent from its peak last year the deflated stock market is emblematic of a wider slowdown in the us economy goldman s analysts said the bank recently cut its forecast for us economic growth for the first half of 2019 from 2 4 per cent to 2 0 per cent us growth will decelerate further to 1 8 per cent in the third and fourth quarters of this year goldman sachs predicted this compares unfavourably with the situation in the second quarter of 2018 when the economy grew by 4 2 per cent there are a number of risks to the growth outlook to global economic outlook hatzius said we will see continued significant drag on growth in the next couple of quarters from financial conditions even though recession risk in the us is relatively low facing down a multitude of domestic and external challenges beijing policymakers must decide on the right balance of stimulus but has been encouraged to abandon the old playbook of issuing more debt in favour of implementing structural reforms failure to do so will increase the risks of a hard landing said carl tannenbaum chief economist at northern trust a us investment house the time has come for china to move away from the ethereal economic model they have embraced during recent decades and accept one that is better grounded the trick in the process is to engineer an orderly descent tannenbaum said in a research note michael every senior asia pacific strategist at rabobank meanwhile warned of the complexity and systemic nature of the task facing beijing s policy wonks the party is facing long term and complex tests in terms of maintaining long term rule reform and opening up a market driven economy and within the external environment he wrote in a note the party is facing sharp and serious dangers of a slackness in spirit lack of ability distance from the people and being passive and corrupt this is an overall judgment based on the actual situation evert added source south china morning post

what s really going on with china s economy it s a 13 trillion question with massive implications for the continued rule of the chinese communist party and president xi jinping as well as the rest of the world for much of which china is the no 1 trading partner what s really going on with china s economy it s a 13 trillion question with massive implications for the continued rule of the chinese communist party and president xi jinping as well as the rest of the world for much of which china is the no 1 trading partner officially things are right on track the latest gdp numbers for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2018 released this week show exactly the managed modest slowdown in economic growth that beijing promised to deliver 6 6 percent annual growth in the world s second largest economy even as headlines trumpeted a 28 year low in china s growth rate that was just what party leadership had pledged knowing that the double digit growth rates posted earlier this century were never coming back the problem is that nobody well almost nobody trusts the official chinese economic data including especially its gdp figures that s because economic growth and the statistics to back it up is more a political target in china than a reflection of the true state of the economy and for years chinese officials at all levels of government cooked statistics to meet those political objectives whenever there s a problem chinese data are meaningless said derek scissors a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute the problem in this case is a clear economic slowdown over the last nine months nothing china publishes in this setting can be trusted for example scissors notes chinese data about the economy don t add up officially telecom equipment sales rose except when they didn t other indicators of how the real economy is performing such as electricity consumption or the amount of freight shipped by rail don t seem to correspond to the headline gdp numbers in any given year also unlike gdp statistics in other economies official chinese numbers suspiciously show almost no variation from quarter to quarter getting a handle on what s really going on with the world s second largest economy is hugely important for multinational firms such as auto companies or apple which have to make investment decisions based on expectations of demand from china s massive internal market and properly understanding just how resilient the chinese economy is matters a great deal to policymakers around the world a sudden slowdown could accelerate domestic political aggravation for xi and the communist party which has relied on supercharged growth to keep its population quiescent the consensus view among economists is that china s economic growth did slow down last year and especially at the end of the year as the trade war with the united states intensified if officials keep telling us that the slowdown merits concern keep telling us that new stimulus measures are coming said george magnus an expert on the chinese economy at the university of oxford s china centre i think we can assume with confidence that all is not well that does sort of show up even in official statistics auto sales in china fell last year for the first time in almost two decades a clear sign that nervous consumers are putting off big ticket purchases the deceleration is coming on the consumption front mainly there s a massive collapse of demand for durable goods especially automobiles said alicia garcía herrero the chief asia pacific economist at the french bank natixis anything that requires a longer term investment that s where you see a collapse the reasons for the slowdown in china s rate of growth are many the global economy is losing steam reducing demand for chinese manufactured goods the international monetary fund imf this week trimmed its forecast for annual global economic growth from 3 7 percent to 3 5 percent and the head of the european central bank ecb on thursday warned of growing risks to europe s economy for china still the workshop of the world an increasingly gloomy outlook for global trade is also a problem the trade war with the united states which began in earnest last fall hasn t had time to do more than dent china s prospects so far but if ongoing trade talks between beijing and washington fail to deliver a broad agreement and if the trump administration follows through on its vow to more than double tariffs on almost everything china exports to america that could change dramatically fundamentally though china s own policies are to blame for its economic woes stressed magnus who last year published red flags a book about the country s economic challenges banks are forced by the government to lend and companies of all sizes are struggling with debt made even harder to bear now that the chinese yuan is weaker and interest rates are rising also under xi the economy s resources have been increasingly channeled toward state owned firms which are less efficient than private sector companies that makes china s planned response another huge stimulus unlikely to be more than a short term band aid beijing already started pumping more money into the economy last year running a large fiscal deficit and has a much bigger stimulus package planned for 2019 to reignite growth for the last five years for example china throttled back public spending on railway construction seeking to rein in local government debt that kind of restraint is out the window with plans afoot for more than 4 000 miles of new rail line this year including 2 000 miles of new high speed track more than exists in all of spain which took nearly three decades to build europe s biggest high speed rail network when china began its economic reform four decades ago the return from government investment to build infrastructure was huge now that the economy is already so large the payoff from spending hundreds of billions of dollars more is a lot less the return on dumping more savings into government dictated investment is now very low scissors said without a sharp focus on increasing productivity all that s going to happen is a minor variation on slower true growth and a higher debt burden a more gradual version of the japanese slowdown plus communist party propaganda to boost consumption beijing is also trying to inject more cash into the economy even as companies and consumers are choking on debt halfhearted efforts over the past year to boost lending haven t worked yet because sentiment has been so negative garcía herrero said banks do not want to lend so the government is forcing them to lend the idea is to put money where it is more productive in the private sector she said adding that she expects the new policy will end up injecting money into the economy over the short term because the banks will have no choice but to comply the hitch is that the solutions needed to keep the economy humming in the short term are at odds with china s own prescription for sustainable growth over the longer term the problem is that china s policies have become incoherent magnus said the country is simultaneously trying to shed debt while hitting ambitious growth targets trying to make banks more disciplined while forcing more loans to companies that might default trying to boost the role of the private sector while ensuring that state owned giants become even bigger and more powerful there are huge implications at home and abroad of china s slowing economy and the communist party s efforts to deal with it trump points to china s slowdown as proof that his tariffs are working and expects it will force beijing to make big concessions to washington the two countries are racing to reach a sweeping agreement over the next month ambitiously meant to address long standing u s concerns about china s economic behavior especially the dominant role of the state and pervasive theft of foreign technology but there s little indication that even a slowing economy will twist xi s arm enough to make him cave to trump the slowdown mildly increases the odds xi will pretend to compromise plus buy commodities like american agricultural goods natural gas and oil scissors said china made a modest offer to buy more u s goods last spring and reportedly just offered to buy a lot more products to win a truce in the trade war but that s about it there is no chance xi will compromise on american demands for structural change he has no alternative model for chinese development other than to acquire technology by any means necessary and to subsidize state owned enterprises scissors said what happens with china s economy also has a huge impact on the rest of the world both the imf and the ecb cited china s slowdown along with trump s trade wars and brexit as reasons for the growing pessimism about economic prospects garcía herrero expects the beefed up stimulus to keep china s economy in decent shape this year she expects gdp growth of about 6 3 percent but warns that a sharper slowdown would hammer emerging markets many of which depend on china s near bottomless appetite for all sorts of commodities including farm products iron coal and oil simply muddling through in the short term though doesn t address the fundamental economic ills china faces more than a decade ago then premier wen jiabao famously dinged the fast growing chinese economy as unstable unbalanced uncoordinated and unsustainable despite years of efforts to rebalance the economy away from heavy industry cheap exports and huge government spending china has yet to come to grips with any of the issues wen flagged somehow sometime the state is going to bite its lip and allow growth to slip to a sustainable rate which may not be a lot higher than 3 percent magnus said much depends on whether the government decides to bite the bullet now or only after another attempt to kick the can down the road the longer they try to avert the acclimatization to lower growth the more unbalanced the economy will become and the longer the rebalancing will take

file photo a woman walks past the headquarters of the people s bank of china pboc the central bank in beijing june 21 2013 reuters jason lee file photo by kevin yao beijing reuters china will take steps to spur growth amid a trade war with the united states but there is limited room for aggressive stimulus in an economy already laden with massive debts and a property market prone to credit driven spikes policy insiders said china s deepening economic slowdown has fanned market expectations of a big spending binge especially if the bruising tariff war with washington escalates intensifying pressure on chinese jobs and threatening social stability such a move plans for which have repeatedly been denied by china s top leaders would come at a price however similar moves in the past have quickly juiced growth rates but also buried the world s no 2 economy under a mountain of debt the room for a strong stimulus is not big and there are very big risks because that will rely on a flood of cash and increased leverage in the economy said a policy insider declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter during the 2008 09 global financial crisis beijing rolled out a 4 trillion yuan 591 billion spending package to fight a downturn that cost 20 million jobs in a matters of months quickly reviving growth but also prompting a credit explosion the obsession of china s leaders with stability led to policy easing in 2012 and 2015 a year marked by a stock market crash a slide in the yuan and sharp capital outflows that further pushed up debt levels and inflated home prices authorities have taken a raft of pro growth measures in the past year in the form of cuts to the levels of cash banks must hold as reserves to spur lending tax cuts and efforts to accelerate infrastructure spending still growth in the world s second largest economy weakened to a 28 year low of 6 6 percent in 2018 and is expected to slow further to 6 3 percent this year sources have told reuters that beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6 6 5 percent this year from around 6 5 percent in 2018 some chinese factories have felt the pinch from higher u s tariffs but there are few signs of a sharp rise in unemployment due to a more resilient services sector and a shrinking pool of workers as a result of the country s demographic changes we should be vigilant about employment pressure but it s too early to talk about serious problems said a second policy insider debt risks the current slowdown was caused by china s deleveraging drive in early 2016 which focused on state firms and local governments before broadening to the financial sector a year later a crackdown on shadow lending pushed up borrowing costs and made it harder for small firms to get funds as the trade war increases headwinds beijing s policy focus has been shifted to supporting growth from reining in debt risks although top leaders remain worried about long term systemic risks that could derail the country s economic ascent president xi jinping said this week that china must be on guard against black swan risks meaning unforeseen events that have extreme consequences while fending off so called grey rhino events obvious threats that go ignored data from the bank for international settlements bis showed that china s debt to gross domestic product gdp ratio climbed to 253 percent at the end of june 2018 from 231 percent at end 2015 although the pace of increases is slowing fitch could cut china s a credit rating or stable outlook if beijing reverts to the kind of debt fueled stimulus programs it has used in the past the firm s top sovereign analyst said earlier this month further reductions in banks reserve requirement ratios rrr are expected in coming quarters but the central bank will not rush into cutting benchmark interest rates more aggressive easing could pressure the yuan aggravate high debt levels and even stoke property speculation given that elevated home prices have put strains on consumers if there is too much liquidity we should worry whether it may flow into unintended areas rather than the real economy said a policy adviser no quick boost to growth china is likely to lean more on fiscal pump priming to support the economy this year as the central government has been struggling to channel more credit into small and private firms that are vital for growth and jobs policy insiders said in december top leaders pledged to step up counter cyclical support for the economy and said fiscal policy would be more forceful and effective and monetary policy would be prudent with appropriate tightness and looseness details on the fiscal stimulus are expected to be unveiled during the annual parliamentary meeting in march analysts expect china to deliver tax and fee cuts of 2 trillion yuan in 2019 versus last year s 1 3 trillion yuan and let local governments issue 2 trillion yuan in off budget special bonds to fund key projects up from 1 35 trillion yuan but the economy may not get a quick boost as the raft of policy measures may take time to kick in and china s high debt levels and falling investment returns could slow down spending stimulus won t be very strong and its impact won t be big said one of the policy insiders the manufacturing sector faces all round oversupply while infrastructure investment is saturated in many places projects that have been launched won t make money new tax cuts including lowering the valued added tax vat for firms could give hard pressed small and private firms a shot in the arm and

by shrutee sarkar bengaluru reuters a synchronised global economic slowdown is under way and any escalation in the u s china trade war would trigger a sharper downturn according to reuters polls of hundreds of economists from around the world that is a major shift in sentiment from just a year ago when economists were optimistic about a significant global upturn but an escalation in trade tensions and tightening financial conditions have hurt activity in most economies and dragged china s growth last year to the weakest in 28 years reuters surveys over the past two years have repeatedly highlighted trade protectionism as one of the prominent downside risks for the global economy in the latest reuters polls of more than 500 economists taken this month growth this year was cut for 33 of 46 economies the respondents were asked about and left unchanged for 10 predictions for only three smaller economies were marginally upgraded the outlook for inflation this year was trimmed for most economies too with lower lows and lower highs over half of nearly 270 economists who answered an additional question said a further escalation in the u s china trade war will likely trigger an even sharper global economic slowdown this year with a march 1 deadline set by the white house for an agreement or risk of an escalation of tariffs on another 200 billion worth of chinese goods both u s president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping are still far apart on key structural elements critical for a deal those concerns coincide with a growing sense of unease among market experts polled by reuters who have consistently lowered their forecasts for various asset prices over the past few months from stock indexes to bond yields to oil irrespective of the truce between presidents trump and xi at their december meeting trade frictions are likely to weigh on activity in 2019 noted janet henry global chief economist at hsbc further tariff increases have been postponed but there has been no mention of the existing tariffs being lifted and the possibility of u s tariffs being imposed on autos is still on the table despite a 90 day truce reached in early

from the outlook on the overall u s economy to the impacts of tariffs and tax reform on farmers and ranchers the american farm bureau federation s four economists shared their insights on a variety of topics during a workshop at the american farm bureau federation s 100th annual convention beef pork poultry afbf economist michael nepveux detailed the strong outlook for animal protein consumption because most u s pork beef and poultry is consumed within the country the farmers who raise those animals are typically far less affected by the trade turmoil while exports certainly serve as a vital market we still rely very heavily on domestic consumption he said still there is quite a bit of growth in export markets with beef and pork in particular the domestic market is somewhat of a mature market so as we keep expanding production we need somewhere to put the protein and that s usually overseas the pork sector s efforts to expand its production and its reach into foreign markets over the last decade has pushed up their exports to almost 25 percent of their production though all three meat sectors will continue to grow nepveux said the pace will likely moderate especially for beef we ve got a lot of beef but we were saved this year by higher than expected domestic demand as well as exports many of the largest foreign destinations for u s beef like japan are not problematic markets beef exports to canada did slip a little bit but the free trade agreement with south korea provides additional opportunities ultimately u s beef exports for 2018 were a record 3 1 billion pounds pork production since 2015 has been steadily increasing to the point that hog inventory in december 2018 was the highest ever reported pork took a harder hit than beef in the trade war with china that coupled with record production pushed prices down making pork more appealing to other foreign customers yes people were buying more but at a discounted price nepveux said on the dairy front record milk production coupled with decreasing consumption in the u s will likely result in u s dairy farmers exporting more milk than the u s is consuming as class i fluid milk within the next decade ramped up poultry production has resulted in more product in cold storage and lower prices which will likely lead to the industry rebalancing in the near future though exports may have slipped a little in china mexico and hong kong other buyers like vietnam taiwan and angola have stepped up to take advantage of the lower prices crop consumption and outlook economic analyst megan nelson s update on 2018 19 crop consumption pace and outlook for acreage this year showed trade troubles with china are driving some u s agriculture exports down significantly at 629 million bushels soybean exports are down 49 percent or 609 million bushels compared to this time last year according to usda s jan 7 federal grain inspection service report the main driver for this is decrease is the 98 percent drop in soybean exports to china representing 708 million bushels nelson explained in addition china s revisions to its grain balance sheet extending back to 2007 08 led to a major shift in the world supply and demand estimates adding a cumulative 10 5 billion bushels to its corn production from 2007 08 to 2017 18 this addition resulted in global corn stockpiles increasing 106 percent from 5 8 billion bushels to 12 2 billion bushels for 2018 19 and 8 2 billion bushels for chinese stocks alone many people nelson said are wondering which crop soybean farmers will move to considering their dire market situation higher corn prices have many analysts predicting corn production will increase between from about 90 million bushels to 92 million bushels which is about a 2 percent increase similarly higher wheat prices will also likely result in boost to wheat acreage highlighting some commodity specific events nelson said 2018 brought on a slew of catastrophic weather conditions throughout the cotton belt leading to 3 6 million acres abandoned that s about 26 percent of total u s planted cotton acres trade labor taxes afbf economist veronica nigh discussed trade labor and tax policy on the labor front nigh addressed the sharp uptick in certified h 2a positions in some states and for some positions the increase is hardly surprising but we re seeing increases in all states and for a variety of positions she said in 2018 h 2a numbers rose 21 percent from the previous year and in 2019 we could see an 18 percent jump from the previous year that means we ll certify almost 300 000 positions which is a lot of positions considering we were at less than 100 000 just seven years ago nigh said just as the number of certified h 2a positions is growing so is the minimum wage rates for h 2a workers known as the adverse effect wage rate the rate for 2019 12 96 is a 6 percent increase from 2018 but as nigh pointed out farmers and ranchers profits are hardly growing as steadily while beans have been in the trade related headlines exports of sorghum pork apples cherries seafood whiskey ginseng and some processed foods are also suffering together with soybeans the u s exports of these commodities to the retaliating countries represent 30 percent or more of their total exports the recently implemented tax cut and jobs act gives a boost to farmers and ranchers by reducing individual tax rates providing unlimited bonus depreciation and doubling the estate tax exemption had these provisions been in place in 2016 the average effective tax rate for a farm would have been reduced by 3 3 percent according to a study by the agriculture department s economic research service the legislation s 20 percent business income deduction will be especially helpful nigh noted had the deduction been available in 2016 over 46 percent of farmers would have been able to use the it and the total amount of this deduction from taxable income would have been 9 6 billion she said again citing ers u s farm economy john newton chief economist said the strong overall u s economy boasting 36 consecutive quarters of positive gross domestic product growth is pushing unemployment rates to a nearly 50 year low despite this stellar performance consumers are starting to get shaky concern over interest rates and the trade war is starting to show itself in a decline in consumer and ceo confidence in the u s economy newton said interest rates have gone up nine times since the recession started and some were initially thinking the federal reserve could bump them up as many as four more times this year president trump s pressure on the federal reserve chairman could hold those increases to no more than two at 66 3 billion net farm income in 2018 was the third lowest in the last 20 years when adjusted for inflation though farmers appear to be pulling in more money they re spending a lot more to raise their animals and grow their crops cash receipts have gone up but so have production expenses including servicing debt newton said another factor in cash receipts are government payments which at 13 6 billion were up 18 percent from the previous year the university of missouri is projecting net farm income will again decrease this year but two key factors disaster payments and trade mitigation assistance remain unknown as does crop size farm debt is a record 410 billion ballooning by 105 billion over the last decade with a lot of that coming from real estate if you look at how much of our debt is represented by the annual income in agriculture this year it s at 97 percent that s a 32 year high another year of low prices combined with higher interest rates and higher costs of servicing those loans really make you wonder how long we can continue to be in this situation across agriculture similarly the u s debt to asset ratio is on the rise although it s nowhere near what it was in the 1980s thanks to the high value of agricultural assets clocking in a 3 04 trillion today u s agriculture s assets were valued at 775 billion
below is the transcript of a cnbc exclusive interview with loh chin hua keppel corporation ceo the interview was first broadcast on cnbc s squawk box asia on 25 january 2019 all references must be sourced to a cnbc interview interviewed by cnbc s sri jegarajah sri jegarajah sri chin hua can we start with the china macro picture what are the signals telling you about the chinese economy loh chin hua loh well i think what we get in more recent times is that the growth in china is slowing demand is also slowing particularly for luxury goods we are watching this very closely because as a group china is a very important market for us even though the short term growth seems to be a bit murkier i think we are still very positive about the medium to long term growth story for china sri and are those signals consistent with growth rates near 6 6 percent which is the official assessment or in reality are they closer to below six percent loh i think it s very difficult to generalize because the chinese market there are quite a number of different cities different regions and they all have their own growth dynamics so for instance in the markets that keppel land is focused on in the jingjinji area in the yangtze pearl delta as well as in the greater bay area and chengdu metropolitan area we still see growth to be quite still quite robust sri that being said does beijing need to introduce more support measures to keep the economy ticking over or is the risk that they could add to asset bubbles loh i think beijing is obviously i think the chinese policy makers they have generally been acknowledged to have done a pretty good job since even after the global financial crisis in terms of managing the economy clearly they will have to find new growth engines if the trade tensions continue to impact on their exports i think there is of course the property market which is quite often where the chinese government may be looked to help boost domestic demand the other area of cost would be on infrastructure but of course i think in the end they will have to balance all that with their own the levels of domestic debt which everyone is kind of watching very closely as well sri and just on this issue chin hua do you think it s a potential problem in the making that they are deleveraging and trying to stimulate the economy at the same time loh they have a tough challenge but i believe that they also have some policy levers that they can use and i think ultimately i think domestic demand you know in terms of confidence et cetera it is imperative that they keep the domestic economy chugging along so this is something that i believe president xi and his policy makers are very focused on sri does beijing need to undertake a major stimulus package with fiscal spending doing the heavy lifting to keep things chugging along loh well it s possible i mean they ve also talk about some tax measures but i think there are various levers that they can they can deploy to try to introduce better demand into the domestic market to stimulate the domestic market sri and you refer to the property market that is a very big driver for broader economic growth especially on the construction side the chinese property market has cooled in recent months does beijing need to step in and how aggressive do they need to be loh the cooling measures are not a new phenomenon it has been operating now for a number of years because i think in the recent years the chinese policy makers are very concerned about asset bubbles and i think rightly so they have taken certain prudential measures to ensure that demand is not too speculative but i think on the ground what we have seen in more recent times is that whilst the cooling measures are still in place in some cities in terms of the way that these measures are being enforced may start to slacken a bit to give a bit more air you know to give more space to the demand side for the residential or for the property market sri the global trade tensions loh yes sri are they the biggest risk to the chinese economy loh well that s certainly one of the challenges that china faces i think export is still a very important part of the chinese economy so i think as china grows as china becomes a more important economic power in fact they are now very important economic power xi will have to find a way to adjust his position relative to the other trading partners sri do you fear that the economic picture in china could worsen in 2019 if the trade situation is not resolved between the u s and china loh i think the general consensus is that if the trade tensions are not resolved between u s and china it would not only be bad for china i think would be bad for the whole world so i think we would also be affected so you know i think you d like to think that if you follow through on that there must be a way for both sides to come to some form of a consensus where they can resolve their issues but generally i think this is not expected to just go away so i think not just for 2019 i think we just have to be more aware that in the future nation to nation tensions will probably be there for a while sri on a global basis some of the market indicators out there are forecasting a recession in the next 12 to 18 months what are the forward indicators that you watch specifically chin hua and what are they telling you loh our businesses are very focused on long term trends because we are a solution provider for sustainable urbanization so we re involved in providing solutions such as infrastructure clean environment property etc so we tend to look more at the long term trends of course short term trends are important because it could impact the outlook in terms of how our customers look at placing orders with us but a lot of the projects they were involved in the decision makers do not look at just short term outlook in terms of growth having said that i will say that we are obviously very keenly watching things like job figures in the u s we are also looking very closely at the demand side in china particularly domestic demand as i shared earlier the slowdown is real we just need to see how the chinese policy makers can act to provide some balance to the domestic demand sri and if you can turn to the u s the growth picture there seems relatively resilient for now loh yes sri do you fear that the slowdown could deepen in the u s and be aggravated by the shutdown loh well certainly the shutdown is going to have an impact if it s going to be prolonged i think the u s is enjoying pretty good recent figures on the job market is quite encouraging having said that it is in a fairly expanded growth phase so one has to expect that at some point the economy in the u s will also slow and if the trade tensions continue i think it s not just bad for china bad for the world but i think it will also be bad for the u s sri does it make sense against that context chin hua for the fed to be cautious loh i believe so of course i m a businessman i m looking for clearly you want the fed the central banks to be very prudent in terms of ensuring that inflation is kept in check and global economies on an even keel but at this point in time given the tail risks out there i will certainly hope that policymakers will be a bit more cautious in terms of their rate adjustments sri and if the fed is dialing down on the pace of rate hikes is that a net positive for the business because it could ease the pressure on mortgages and from your perspective ease the pressure on holding costs on inventory loh well certainly a number of our solutions include things like properties and infrastructure assets which are very long dated assets with cash flow whether we develop it ourselves or we help our customers build it an interest rate environment that is more benign would be more positive in general we also have a number of reits and keppel capital these are kind of more focused on generating income for the unit holders so again if interest rate environment is more benign that will be helpful sri give us a read on market conditions as you see them in 2019 what are they looking like what do you characterize as the biggest risk to growth earnings and revenue at keppel loh i relate it back to our business on the offshore marine side i ve just shared in our fourth quarter results briefing although kom made a loss for 2018 that loss was on the back of provisions additional provisions that we had to take so you take away rids we made a net operating profit for 2018 the whole year and that s quite remarkable because this is after a period of growth up to 2014 when the oil price took a turn for the worst we have been rightsizing keppel offshore marine over the past couple of years today we are fighting fit and i m very glad you know this one of the highlights was that you know we finally broke even on our offshore marine business i ve also shared that the offshore marine sector is starting to look a bit more optimistic although i will caution that we do not expect a v shaped recovery in the offshore sector but we re starting to see more enquiries particularly on the production assets like fpsos flngs our push into gas has also paid handsomely we are reaping the dividends from that push there are orders that we just secured on the gas side this ranged from flng vessels conversion with gimi for bp sri so the new orders pipeline for 2019 is looking fairly healthy how would you characterize it loh we don t provide a forward forecast for the year but i ve shared that we are cautiously optimistic last year our new orders were higher than the year before and we are cautiously optimistic for 2019 sri that being said chin hua profitability isn t there a risk that it s going to remain under pressure on the o m side because project breakevens are around 40 45 a barrel loh actually oil price is just one of the factors that will determine the demand for the solutions that we provide so to give you an example i think at today s oil price say anywhere from 55 to 60 dollars almost all solutions can work in the different fields whether it s jack ups or the deep floaters but it s really dependent also on the oil companies the ultimate customers so what we ve seen initially when the oil price corrected was that most of the oil companies were very careful about their cash flow they want to continue to pay dividends to their shareholders they may want to keep some of their cash for m a activities but i think in more recent times we are seeing that oil companies are also now giving fid approvals particularly for production assets because they need the production to boost their cash flow and i think ultimately the drilling will start very soon because in the course of the last five years most oil companies their reserves have also been depleted so at some point they will have to sri when you look at keppel corp s share price over a 12 month period it s not a very pretty chart down more than 40 per cent what do you put that down to loh well i think maybe there is still a lack of appreciation for what we have done i think the market perhaps it s taking some time for the market to fully appreciate some of the changes some of the very profound changes that are being made to our business model over the last few years they tend to look at us in the past as an offshore marine business or as a property business depending on which segment provides the bulk of the returns or the profits for the group but if you look at the group today we keppel see ourselves as a solution provider for sustainable urbanization by that we mean urbanization is a trend that is secular so it doesn t matter what happens in the short term but if we look at a very long term basis urbanization will continue as you urbanize you ll need energy so this energy can be fossil fuels or can be renewables you will also need clean environment you need clean water et cetera so these are environmental engineering solutions that we provide of course you need urban space to live in which is again a business that we re in and finally we also have a business we call connectivity so this will be in the form of the data centers that we run or the urban logistics that we have and of course m1 sri which leads us neatly on to that story why do you want majority ownership of m1 its share price is falling it s in dire need of restructuring is it really worth the effort loh we believe so i think you know keppel has been involved in m1 so this is not a new business for us keppel first got involved in m1 i believe in 1994 when we were the founding shareholder even before it was listed and we ve invested over the years about a 170 million in total in m1 and in terms of the distribution and various bonus shares which we liquidated or we monetized over that period we ve collected about 737 million so by all accounts m1 had been a very good investment for keppel but as you know that was before the recent changes in the telco industry in singapore with the introduction of the fourth telco and of course with mvnos coming in the market has become more competitive i think we took a view that you know i think two years ago together with our partners we did a strategic review on whether we could potentially exit from this together unfortunately we didn t get a price that at least keppel was happy with but i think now we see that whilst it is an industry that is going through a lot of disruption we think that there are still opportunities there if someone like us together with our partner sph can gain control then we can then digitize the business we can put in place some cost management measures both from the front end and the back end and then finally it s also about how we see m1 now becoming part of the solutions we provide under the connectivity space sri so it sounds like you are convinced that you can unlock some real value at m1 if you have a bigger size of the pie does that imply that 2 06 is the full and final bid loh it is definitely a full and final bid because we had made that means the company that is bidding which is part of keppel and sph our partner in this exercise have made an announcement i think a couple of days ago to say that the 2 06 is our final price sri do your shareholders think it s a good idea loh i think the point is that right now you have to take a view that at some point you have to believe there s value in it and if we did not think there was value we would not be involved sri it s been reported that m1 s biggest stakeholder axiata considers your bid inadequate under what circumstances would you sweeten your bid loh well clearly right now i mean we have already declared that we are not going to increase the price so under no circumstances will we increase the price sri okay let me talk to you about the keppel o m brazil bribery case i know it s been a very difficult period for you keppel is a glc investors were clearly very shocked when this happened how badly has this tarnished the brand loh it was a shock to all of us clearly the brand has taken the hit as someone said it takes years to build a brand but you can lose it quite quickly at the same time i am also encouraged by the people that we talk to both internally and externally particularly our customers they still have confidence this is clearly a misstep but they have confidence that keppel with our track record will get this fixed and that we will come back and i think of course we are not taking anything too casually we are also working very hard to make sure that this never happens again sri can i just ask you then what guarantee can you give shareholders that oversights of compliance has been tightened to ensure that this does not happen again loh the oversight and compliance have definitely been tightened but i think beyond that it is really also about the culture i think if you look at the company we have probably been amongst the first amongst companies in singapore or even in asia where we take safety very seriously so we believe that all our workers have a right to get home safe every night so we have gone on this safety journey for many years safety was never was not initially in the shipyard in the early days was probably not as important a consideration but i would say that in the last 20 years we have really put a huge emphasis on safety it is a journey that we will never complete because you know we are still working very hard to make sure that you know our workers are all safe sri safety was not in question though was it it was the perception of corruption at keppel o m loh yeah i mean maybe i m taking a bit longer to explain but i think the point is that safety is something that s important to us so when you look at safety or you look at bribery it has some of the same features because we also have a duty to ensure that our colleagues do not come to harm so you can come to harm in the form of a workplace accident but as we know today if you are exposed and you are unaware and you do something that s wrong and that causes a problem from an anti bribery point of view it can also affect the individuals so i think if we apply the same way that we look at safety which is really about culture which is my point it s really not just about processes but to apply the right culture so that all of us know that it s not just doing the things right but it s doing the right thing sri okay if the culture is changing then what does it mean in practical terms at the company does it mean you will look at introducing a whistleblower policy after this case so that if somebody has an issue with the way the company is being run they can safely and independently make it known loh we have a whistle blowing policy in place for some years but of course in light of what has happened we have strengthened it so today we have an outside party that is involved on a whistle blower hotline so you can call 24 7 and you can speak to someone that s not a keppel person but an outside party and you can speak in different languages and this is not just about anti bribery it is also to give us better controls sri what bothers me chin hua is that these solicit payments were made over a 10 year period to your credit you took action against 17 employees why did no one spot this malfeasance within that 10 years loh i think those questions have been covered last year i think i d rather not go back into it again the main point here is that we have a global resolution we are very determined to put right and we have spent a lot of time and resources to make sure that this does not happen again and as i said it s not just about processes or controls but it s also about getting the right culture to make sure that people know it s not just about doing things right but doing the right thing winning business ethically and legally sri does this affect how you do business in future and does it affect how you d bid for contracts in brazil or elsewhere you operate internationally loh sure there is no exception anywhere we operate we d follow these rules it is not something that d have any exception i believe we can still run business legally and ethically based on the superior solutions that we have sri chin hua we d leave it there thank you very much sir end media contact clarence chen communications manager apac cnbc international d 65 6326 1123 m 65 9852 8630 clarence chen cnbc com about

andy serwer every january the world s top powerbrokers gather to rub shoulders in davos this faraway skiing village in the swiss alps hosts more than 3 000 leaders in business politics academia and culture german chancellor angela merkel imf managing director christine lagarde jamie dimon and even prince william will be there turn a corner and you ll bump into german economists klaus schwab who founded the world economic forum which puts on the annual conference the meeting this year tackles how to build a better world as technology relentlessly transforms it we ll discuss that and much more in this special edition of influencers welcome to a special edition of the influencers in davos switzerland home of the world economic forum s annual meeting today we will feature three influential women from the world of finance first christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund joins me now i m here with christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund christine welcome christine lagarde thank you advertisement advertisement andy serwer so i wanted to ask you about a new report you ve just put out about sustainable development goals what does that entail exactly christine lagarde we just put it up this morning the sustainable development goals are the 17 key objectives that are set for all of us to help the low income countries and emerging markets to actually reach a decent level in terms of health education access to water sanitation lots of other things but we have focused on those key elements and what we measured is what is the distance between where those countries are today and where they hope to be in 2030 if they reach those goals and how much it will cost them and we find a staggering number for both low income countries and emerging market they would have to spend annually the like of 15 of gdp for the low income countries about 4 of gdp for emerging market economies no way they can do it by themselves so the point we are trying to make is measure how much it will cost and figure out who else is going to spend on those countries to help them reach the sustainable development goals and it calls for public support which is the oda it calls for private sector involvement and the business community has to really look at those countries look at those business opportunities to help them reach the sustainable development goals advertisement advertisement and to also get a good return maybe not in as short a term as they used to but a little bit more medium term but certainly with a great prospect andy serwer so you have identified these goals you see a shortfall is it the responsibility of the imf to try to reduce that shortfall and identify and then seek those funds christine lagarde it s our duty to help countries each of them with its specificities raise revenues so we call it domestic revenue mobilization and we provide technical assistance for that it s our duty to help them figure out what is their fiscal plan for the medium term how much do they want to raise over the course of the next few years it s our duty to help them spend efficiently the difference between an inefficient white elephant project and an efficient properly focused project is monumental that s our duty to also help them and it s also our duty to identify for them what are the juncture points the hot spot points where clearly governance is going to become an issue and we ll prevent the private sector from actually directing the investment to those countries that s what we do advertisement advertisement andy serwer you also put out a report this week the imf did in talking about the forecast and revising the forecasts for 2019 the initial response was wow this is a pretty negative report i m already hearing revisionist takes on it that well it s not that bad so i m asking you what is your take on the report christine lagarde we look at the half full and the half empty and we try to be completely cold and honest about it we revised down by 0 2 so in october we said global growth will be 3 7 now we say 3 5 it s not a major major revision it s a rather modest one and we still have quite decent growth 3 5 is nothing to be shy about or ashamed of it s pretty good where i look at the half empty glass is that we see risks on the horizon and the horizon is getting closer to us and those risks start with the like of here in europe brexit how will it pan out when what will be the transition period what will be the divorce and future collaboration terms big question mark second one trade friction tension war whatever you call it how will it be resolved what tariff will be reduced or increased which sectors will be affected again there is negotiations going on there is wto efforts for reform but it s also a big question mark advertisement advertisement and then you look at the financing costs that will apply as economies actually come out of this big financial crisis that will apply to countries to corporate then to households that have considerably increased their debt level relative to their activity so those are the three critical factors that we see there are many others one which is in a way a subset of the trade issue that i just mentioned would be an acceleration of the slowdown in china which is a major economic power and of which the slowdown would really impact countries in the vicinity but the global economy at large andy serwer i want to ask a little bit more about china two points there of course the us china trade war if you can call it that which i think you can buy now number one and number two the questions about china s maybe expansionistic tendencies the belt and road initiative they have and their stories about how they re creating economic dependence by some countries in the vicinity so what is your take on both of those madam lagarde christine lagarde well first of all i would observe that relative to october there are although the risks are coming closer to us i think there is a little bit of hope back in october there was not that step by step dialogue that we are seeing in place gradually between the us and china advertisement advertisement we don t know exactly who is coming to visit whom at the moment but it seems pretty clear that there is a real dialogue and that a dialogue actually bears on both the bilateral relationship but also the more fundamental issues that will apply on a global basis such as ip protection such as subsidies such as state owned enterprise activities and compulsory transfer of technologies if those topics are exhaustive of what is being discussed so on that front there is something happening which is in and of itself a pretty good development but we still have the big question mark on the other one it s fairly natural that an economy actually wants to grow what i think is the big issue at the moment is under what terms and conditions and on an international basis how even handed how respectful is this attempt to grow and to expand and i think in that particular respect there are two areas where we three areas i would say were more work needs to be done on a collaborative basis the first one we just discussed is trade the second one is the whole area of standard setting when it comes to the digital developments that we are seeing because i don t think that anybody is keen to have a global economy that would be split into three different zones or two different zones if that was the case where data rules are different where technological standards are going to take us apart rather than more together advertisement advertisement and the third one is on the issue of debt we are clearly all of us need transparency need good understanding of who owes what to whom and what are the terms and conditions because if the circumstances were hardening and if we had to look into the financial situation of many more countries than we do at the moment then we clearly need clarity of data transparency of terms and that s a project that we are working on actively altogether andy serwer interesting shifting gears to the united states if you were president trump s economic advisor what would you tell him christine lagarde i don t think he would pick me but andy serwer if he did and if you were in that position what would you tell him advertisement advertisement christine lagarde i would try to identify how a well governed multilateral trade can be efficient and can be beneficial for each and every participant i think that would be my mission number one because i think there is generally too much of a focus on the bilateral relationship the bilateral surplus or deficit and you talk to all the business community they work on a global basis they ve organized their supply chain on a global basis they operate in multiple countries not just the big corporates but the smes and some of the startups the fact that we can communicate and that the backbone of technology empowers small businesses but they need to have access they need to be able to trade on the basis of multilaterally accepted rules so i think i would try to make that point advertisement advertisement andy serwer i think back in october you said it was appropriate for the federal reserve to be raising rates do you still feel that way and what do you think about what jay powell is doing christine lagarde we ve tried to avoid comments on what central banks do because we are very respectful of their independence so all we are saying about central banks and the fed is please stay as data dependent as you have been and continue to be so and please communicate as judiciously and as appropriately your gradual phasing out as you have done and please continue doing that andy serwer so a normalization of rates makes sense to you christine lagarde if it is data dependent and if it is well communicated yes absolutely advertisement advertisement andy serwer and maybe a common denominator when we re talking about brexit and the united states other issues in europe and maybe even in china is a rise in populism nationalism do you think that s brought on by wealth and income inequality what does it come from and how can we address that christine lagarde many more competent people would have to address that question because i think that it s multifaceted it has as much to do with the reality of growing inequalities in many countries of the world particularly in terms of wealth inequality where the numbers are more staggering than in terms of income inequality as it has to do with the sense of being disenfranchised not being rooted in your own cultural system of references being taken over by technologies and you re not just the way in which you watch entertainment but the way in which you do your work is actually being totally transformed and disrupted so i think it s the compounding of all those things that bring people to falling prey to populism and nationalism and there s nothing wrong with being a patriot but i think that being a nationalist is not conducive to that good open system where trade of products and services can actually prosper and bring well being for people if it is trade for all not trade for some andy serwer i want to ask you about women empowerment you were at a goldman sachs event last evening with the ceo david solomon goldman sachs 10 000 women what was your takeaway from that event and how do you think the role of women has been enhanced in the private sector and the public sector christine lagarde we just recently published a study which i mentioned yesterday at the event which shows that there is a lot of progress to be made in that particular sector of activity the financial sector if you look at the composition of boards in that sector only 20 of them are women and if you look at the ceos of the financial sector only 2 are women there s something wrong because our societies don t look like that and if you look at graduates from universities and business schools it doesn t look like 20 or 2 it s a lot more than that so my encouragement to all banks to all financial sector representatives is be careful what you look like you have to mirror your client base you have to include all talents and you have an unbelievable source of untapped talents the woman and then you have to be more granular in terms of diversity and look at lots of other considerations such as race such as educational background and you have to do that in a very segmented way look at throughout the organization andy serwer and you mentioned progress in japan you also had a new name for goldman sachs which i liked christine lagarde goldman woman sachs andy serwer right which was funny christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund thanks very much for your time christine lagarde thank you andy serwer up next is jp morgan s wealth and asset management ceo mary erdoes so we were just talking about the markets wild and crazy really since december never a dull moment but especially since december and we had the bounce back what is your outlook for 2019 and how are you managing that mary erdoes the outlook is difficult given all the moving pieces and here in davos we talk a lot about the laundry list of what they are from the government shutdown in the us to the chances of brexit or a hard brexit to many of the issues in the middle east and of course the china trade between the two largest economies and if that gets any worse than that it already has or doesn t have a resolution that could weigh very heavily on the markets and so everyone s trying to juggle all of those things and of course we have the economy that s still relatively strong everywhere in the world mostly in the developed markets but also in the emerging economies and then the markets that price in what s happened in the past and where it s going in the future and you can see the volatility that you mention especially as we had the fourth quarter of last year which is trying to figure out what that future price is and to bring forward what they think is going to happen and so days like december 24 are difficult days like december 26 are great days for people who are brave enough to go into the markets we saw a lot of clients do that by the way and my hope is that people will see through this not because it is a perfectly rosy picture out there but because the most important thing for us at jpmorgan chase is really helping people to invest for the long term and so there s going to be ups and downs if you take a little money off the table put a little bit more money overweight but to come in and out of the markets and think you re going to time that it s a really very challenging thing to do very few people succeed andy serwer one of the benefits of being here in davos mary is that you get an international perspective and the flavor is there a difference in the way international investors are looking at the markets versus american investors mary erdoes that s a great question i wouldn t say it s international versus i would say it s always home country bias you re always most comfortable or more comfortable investing in the things you know the things you can see and have some familiarity with it if i told you that i think the greatest investment that you could make in 2019 is in the emerging markets you could believe me but you might not have the same feel for it if you didn t live in those countries and i do think that emerging markets equity and emerging markets debt are some of the greatest opportunities we have particularly if the fed doesn t raise rates quite as aggressively as it had planned it makes for a great backdrop and emerging markets economies they used to only make up 10 of the market cap of the world s investable markets now they re 30 that s going to continue to grow and the more people can get invested in that early the better off they re going to be andy serwer when you talk about emerging markets mary it sounds like a risk on way of thinking about 2019 is that the case mary erdoes emerging markets it sounds like it s a risk on there are very very manageable ways to get access to that and it doesn t mean your whole portfolio goes there doesn t mean all of your equities are there it means that you should have a portion of your risk assets to asset classes like that and to do it in a way that s there for the long term that you don t have to think i need that money in two years that s not a place you would put that money but really thinking about how do i set up a portfolio for the long term the statistic that s always on the forefront of my mind is people who try to time the markets if you put money in the markets 20 years ago and you just closed your eyes you would have tripled your money if you missed just the top 10 days over 20 years you would have only grown at 50 now that s not a bad outcome but here s the bad outcome if you miss the top 20 days you re flat if you miss the top 30 days now you re just a little bit more than half of the money you put in and it just gets consecutively worse from there and of course you also know that the best days are within a two week proximity of the worst days in most cases so it s very hard to time the markets getting a long term plan in place really thinking about what do i need for liquidity purposes for short term issues and then what can i put away for my retirement for my family how do i think about it that s the most important focus andy serwer day traders mary s calling you out so listen up let me ask you about the government a little bit the dysfunction the government shutdown is it impacting your business how are we ever going to get out of this mess mary erdoes so the government shutdown is obviously impacting the whole country but it s not the first time so we ve had many government shutdowns in history the kind that shut the government down and stopped payments have happened 15 times since 1982 almost every president has had one this president has had three president clinton had one that was the longest until this one 21 days over a medicare issue this will solve itself and we will get back to normal the problem is the longevity of this one you can think about short term government delays as short term problems that then get rectified quite quickly the longer it goes you re not going to make that up in the economy you re not going to go to dinner twice next week because you missed going out to dinner this week because you didn t have the money to go out and afford that or to buy you an extra tank of gas et cetera so a lot of those things are expenditures that are not going to happen that s going to have a weight on the gdp of the us that s then going to weigh on the minds of ceos who think about should i put money into my next plant property or equipment that i m going to invest in for the future should i wait so i think the longer it goes you re going to get a wait and see both from ceos of corporations that are trying to operate as well as individuals and then of course the most important thing for us as a bank jp morgan chase we want to make sure that the people who are suffering from not getting paychecks that we re going to do whatever we can to try and help them and the earlier we can see those problems the earlier we can work with them to try and help them through their hard times andy serwer you re interested in some philanthropic work i know you re interested in women s empowerment and other issues like that there s a lot at the fore here i understand you went to georgetown were one of the few women who majored in math back at that time so what stands out to you here at davos and what are you most interested in mary erdoes the nice thing about davos is you take a minute to think about all of the things from around the world so nearly every country is represented nearly every movement is represented and you start to think about what you can do both as an individual but as well as a company and so when i think about what jp morgan chase does whether it s our women on the move work whether it s our vets work we had 100 000 vets mission it s now up to a million vets that we want to retrain and put to work in concert with other financial companies whether it s the work that we do in cities we have 500 million that we re putting to work in cities that we think we can help get the retraining get the financial wherewithal detroit is one of our most important ones we recently announced the outskirts of paris chicago washington dc so there s a lot that we want to do and not just the money but the employees of jp morgan chase they take a lot of time out of their free weekends and other extra time to give back to those communities and for us that s the most important thing and that s what makes us so proud of being part of jp morgan chase andy serwer all right mary thank you so much for joining us today mary erdoes thank you andy serwer finally i welcome kpmgs ceo lynne doughtie i m here with lynne doughtie the ceo of kpmg lynne welcome great to see you lynne doughtie thank you thanks for having me andy serwer so we re here in davos lynne doughtie we are andy serwer what are you hearing what s on the minds of people that you ve been talking to lynne doughtie we re hearing really three main topics i think it s emerging technologies and the impact that that has on the workforce and society what comes along with that is cyber i think the cyber risk which is increasing as a big topic here and then of course geopolitical everything geopolitical the impacts on the economy and territorialism is a big topic as well andy serwer let me ask you a little bit about what s going on globally especially with regard to china obviously we have huge issues in terms of the united states and china and the trade war what are you hearing from your customers and maybe your employees in terms of that picture lynne doughtie so i think and we saw it with the imf results yesterday as well that it s slowing it s definitely slowing in china we re seeing that and i think that it s not just about china but the impact that that has particularly in europe and other places and so the knock on effect of the slowing growth in china is very concerning but i think that you hit it with the trade wars and how that will be resolved that s creating the biggest uncertainty that i hear ceos talk about particularly in the us and how we can move on from that to have more certainty about the impact of the policy and how businesses are impacted andy serwer we re potentially looking at slower growth back in the united states as well lynne is that something you re concerned about do you see that happening and what s your take lynne doughtie well we see it but i think the us is the bright spot around the globe and although growth is appearing to slow a little bit i think that most ceos are pretty optimistic in the us around the growth prospects and so i think when you look at emerging technologies the opportunities that that creates the impact that that has on the value that they can bring to customers and the services that they provide i think it s a pretty good picture in the us right now we ve had this long growth cycle and although it s slowing and it s hard to predict i think the next 12 months i think ceos are feeling pretty optimistic andy serwer all right lynne doughtie ceo kpmg we re going to leave it at that thanks so much for joining us lynne lynne doughtie thank you andy we have a special bonus interview he s a world famous musician philanthropist and entrepreneur will i am i m here with will i am the musician and founder of i am and his partner alain bejjani who is the ceo of majid al futtaim welcome gentlemen great to see you both will i am good to see you too alain bejjani thank you andy serwer all right so let me start with you will and ask you about i am and you re ai voice agent not assistant will i am well yeah so we ve created a platform artificial intelligence voice operating system that s contextual conversational and cross domainable and the tool that made our system we wanted to productize that so other companies and retail accommodations can make their agents or assistants and in the efforts of doing that we met maf majid al futtaim and they ve partnered with us invested in our company and helping us on our efforts to complete what we call the arc which is accommodation retail coalition andy serwer will how did you get into ai there s so many different parts and facets of technology this is one an important one but why ai will i am so two steps one i was blessed to have attended professor patrick at mit s ai class back in 2003 and 2004 and i was intrigued by it andy serwer way back will i am so every time i would go to boston i would sit in his class and he s writing a book and i have a forward on the book so back in 2003 i was interested and intrigued by that in 2009 i sat in the futurist department at intel and they had a hurdle that no one was making marine operating systems on their mobile chipsets and so i had the notion of creating an operating system because operating systems don t come around every day and i told myself as soon as i have some disposable income i m going to put a team together to create a voice operating system so the mac os you need your trackpad and a keyboard ios you just need your finger there is no still to this day there isn t a true voice operating system outside of the system that we built it s an operating system in every sense of the word so it can work across different devices so it s ios android work on linux it s able to work on simple computation systems like raspberry pi and even simpler than that just calling on a dial up just making a phone call talking to our system on a phone call andy serwer now you recently did a piece in the economist where you talked about data identity and privacy issues what do you have to say to facebook and google in terms of what they re doing with our data the monarchs i think you call them will i am yeah data monarchies so i m in no place to say anything to these companies especially when i still use their systems the problem that we have in society is not the facebooks of the world and the googles of the world it s that there is no alternative there is no other system for me to use where i could retain my data in a way that s simple for me to understand what s going on and for me to enrich my lives with the data that i make there is no operating system for people you have access to an operating system but it s not yours you have access to alexa but it s not yours so we aim in our company to create an ai and os for people and to fill that void that s there so if there s value in data how do we bring that down to the person andy serwer isn t there concerns about ai and privacy with artificial intelligence though as well will i am so the concerns are from the snapshot of today the business models of these companies today are what bring up the concerns the privacy if it was my ai and it was my operating system or yours at home watching if it was your ai and your operating system you re going to want your ai to be smart for you so you will open it up if you knew the terms and conditions and can understand them in a simple way so i believe the privacy issues are just the business model is what s scary the business model is what s funky so the company that s going to rise tomorrow is a company that s going to have a new business model thinking about the person and the community they live in first before business and business will be there andy serwer that s will i am and alain bejjani both joining us here today thank you both gentlemen will i am thank you andy serwer thank you to christine lagarde mary erdoes lynne doughtie and will i am for joining me and thank you for watching this special edition of influencers from the world economic forum in davos switzerland

london reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them and so begins the pause the u s federal reserve convenes its first monetary policy meeting of 2019 after hiking rates for a fifth time in as many quarters in december but while it has forecast two more hikes for 2019 the darkening global economic outlook convulsing stock markets and a record long government shutdown are clouding the policy picture now fed chairman jerome powell is preaching patience with regard to future rate increases and he s been joined by two other governors and all 12 fed regional bank presidents but what happens after such a pause interest rate futures markets currently assign a roughly 20 percent probability for a move above the current 2 25 2 50 percent range for the fed funds target rate at any 2019 meeting a year from now a rate cut is almost as probable as a rate hike most previous fed pauses are associated with the end of a cycle and followed by a change in policy direction yet the current tightening cycle and previous two easing phases have featured mid cycle pauses so how rare would a rate hike resumption be after this newest holding period in both the 2000 2003 and 2007 2009 cutting cycles the fed took at least one hiatus of six months or longer and resumed cuts later in the present one they ve managed extended pauses twice since this cycle s first december 2015 hike a full year lapsed between the first and second hike six months between hikes four and five graphic bring on the pause oh china where art thou alarm bells from the international monetary fund imf are still ringing in investors ears after the fund cut global growth forecasts warning in particular that failure to resolve trade tensions could further destabilise the world economy so markets will focus on chinese manufacturing data due on thursday and friday to glean how the world s number two economy is faring chinese vice premier liu he will also head to the united states on wednesday and thursday with a 30 member delegation for the next round of trade negotiations there are reasons to be hopeful of some kind of agreement even if u s commerce secretary wilbur ross said the two sides were miles and miles from resolving their trade issues he did after all admit there was a fair chance of a deal eventually so far there is little clarity on how bad it could get for china s and for the world economy and how much stimulus beijing may be happy to provide this time round china s obsession with market stability and the quality of credit growth adds to that challenge graphics on asian central bank policy rates and global economic outlook graphic manufacturing activity in asia plan b for brexit another week another vote on jan 29 britain s parliament will debate prime minister theresa may s proposed next brexit steps as well as alternative plans put forward by lawmakers including some that seek to delay britain s march 29 exit from the eu parliament won t be asked to vote to approve a revised brexit deal and given the crushing margin by which may s plan a was defeated just a week ago that s just as well greater focus though is on averting a no deal brexit a scenario in which the uk crashes out of the eu with no trade agreement that looks achievable the opposition and many ruling party members will likely back an amendment providing for a nine month extension to brexit should a deal not be agreed by feb 26 meanwhile warnings against no deal brexit are coming in thick

español português economic activity in latin america continues to rise but at a slower rate than previously anticipated the weakening global economy and rising policy uncertainty are contributing to slowing latin america s growth momentum overall the region is expected to advance by 2 percent in 2019 and 2 5 percent in 2020 still well below peer countries in other regions a tightening of global financial conditions and lower commodity prices brought on by u s china trade tensions have contributed to the region s slowdown in addition monetary policy was tightened in some economies to contain inflationary pressures stemming partly from currency depreciation which further dampened growth looking at fiscal policy which has also become less accommodative about half of the region s economies reduced their primary deficits as a percent of gdp in 2018 but this has not been enough to put public debt on a downward path except for argentina policy uncertainty clouds the outlook following a series of highly anticipated elections throughout latin america policy uncertainty in some of the region s larger economies has risen weighing on the outlook for example in mexico the halting of an airport construction project and some backtracking in energy and education reforms have increased policy uncertainty in the country in brazil a fragmented congress could create hurdles to the implementation of the ambitious structural reform agenda fiscal consolidation and pension reform continued policy uncertainty could discourage future investment and harm growth prospects for the region risks global and domestic several risks could further harm the outlook for latin america and the caribbean for instance escalating trade tensions between china and the united states or a slowdown in some major economies could result in lower trade growth for the region the region would also suffer if global financial conditions tighten further including spikes in global financial volatility higher u s interest rates and a stronger u s dollar additionally higher volatility in global markets could result in less capital flowing to the region potentially harming investment potential domestic risks include lower confidence due to policy uncertainty in brazil and mexico and election related uncertainty in argentina in brazil market sentiment could deteriorate with lack of progress in pension system reforms or fiscal consolidation mexico s business confidence could suffer if the role of the public sector in the economy expands the fiscal position deteriorates or there are setbacks in the new trade pact with the united states and canada in argentina the upcoming general elections in 2019 could reduce reform appetite policies to support the expansion as the global economy slows the narrow window of opportunity in the region to complete reforms the fixing of the metaphorical roof is closing debt and deficit reduction will need to continue in several countries to ensure debt sustainability these policies should minimize the adverse effects on economic activity and poverty including by protecting infrastructure investment and well targeted social expenditure while cutting non priority spending further monetary policy will need to manage the trade off between supporting growth and keeping inflation expectations anchored in the face of currency depreciation and volatile commodity prices maintaining exchange rate flexibility is critical to withstand shocks south america in argentina the economy fell into recession in 2018 while a severe drought significantly reduced agricultural output and exports the strong peso depreciation around mid 2018 fueled inflation reducing disposable income and investor confidence the government s stabilization plan based on revised and strengthened monetary and fiscal policies helped reduce the financial turmoil and stabilized the exchange rate inflation and inflation expectations have been on a downward trend since october and look set to continue a slow decline in 2019 this should allow a gradual fall in interest rates which together with higher real wages and stronger exports is expected to trigger a recovery of economic activity starting from the second quarter of 2019 in brazil growth is projected to rise over 2 percent in 2019 20 for the first time since 2013 the new administration s market friendly reformist agenda has helped boost business confidence and improve the near term growth prospects the key policy priorities are to reform the pension system and reduce the budget deficit to ensure public debt sustainability growth in chile will remain strong in 2019 20 led by robust private consumption and buoyant investment the monetary policy normalization that started in october 2018 is expected to proceed gradually a moderate narrowing of the structural deficit is expected guided by the announced fiscal targets the implementation of the authorities structural reform agenda would lead to a more favorable growth outlook colombia s economic growth is projected to increase led by continued monetary policy support election year spending by subnational governments implementation of the 4g infrastructure agenda and a positive impact of recent tax policy changes on investment a financing law approved last december comprising revenue enhancing tax reform including increases to vat consumption and personal income taxes is expected to help achieve the fiscal target for 2019 but a lower corporate tax burden while potentially boosting investment and growth may result in weaker tax revenues from 2020 onwards peru s economy is estimated to have expanded nearly 4 percent in 2018 supported by higher commodity prices and countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies growth is projected to stay close to 4 percent in 2019 20 with robust private domestic demand offsetting a gradual fiscal consolidation in venezuela the economic and humanitarian crisis has continued real gdp is projected to decline further in 2019 bringing the cumulative decline since 2013 to over 50 percent driven by plummeting oil production and worsening conditions for the non oil sector hyperinflation and outward migration are also projected to intensify in 2019 evolving political developments add another layer of uncertainty to the country s outlook mexico central america and the caribbean in mexico the outlook continues to be clouded by uncertainty growth projections for 2019 and 2020 were revised down to 2 1 and 2 2 percent respectively due to weaker growth momentum in 2018 uncertainty around the new administration s policies and tighter than expected monetary and financial conditions strict implementation of the prudent 2019 budget which seeks to maintain the primary surplus at 1 percent of gdp will be crucial in demonstrating the new administration s commitment to fiscal responsibility and the continuing reduction of the public debt ratio advancing much needed structural reforms can boost medium term potential growth in central america and the dominican republic economic activity is projected to pick up in 2019 20 but at a slower pace than originally anticipated the major revisions took place in costa rica where a fiscal reform bill was passed in december while this was a critical step towards re establishing fiscal sustainability it will lower growth in the near term in nicaragua social unrest and political uncertainty have also hurt growth prospects economic activity in the caribbean is still projected to pick up in 2019 20 thanks to robust tourism from the u s reconstruction from the devastating hurricanes of 2017 in some tourism dependent countries and higher commodity production in some commodity exporters

our goal was to meet or exceed a 1 return on assets which we achieved net income hit a new company best at 13 7 million for the year which included opening two new branch offices smith added

of 113 000 or 0 9 interest income with respect to loans excluding pci loans increased 276 000 or 2 3 during the fourth quarter when compared with the third quarter of 2018 this increase was

balances for interest bearing deposits increased by 26 8 million or 2 8 however the cost of these deposits increased from 1 10 in the third quarter of 2018 to 1 22 in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting in the 7 9 increase in interest expense the growth in interest bearing deposits in the fourth quarter of 2018 allowed the company to reduce the level of more expensive fhlb and other borrowings by 25 9 million on average during the quarter the increased rates paid on interest bearing deposits and wholesale funding resulted in an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities

securities income increased 336 000 for 2018 compared with 2017 interest on deposits in other banks increased 107 000 for 2018 over 2017 primarily due to an increase in the return on those balances from 1 26 to 2 16 in 2018 on a tax equivalent basis income on securities decreased 326 000 primarily the result of less benefit on bank qualified municipal securities under the act despite the lower benefit from the decrease in the tax rate the tax equivalent yield on the portfolio actually increased and was 3 15 for 2018 based on a 21 tax rate and 3 12 for 2017 based on a 34 tax rate interest expense of 12 1 million represented an increase of 2 9 million or 31 0 for 2018 compared with 2017 average interest bearing liabilities increased 45 5 million or 4 5 as loan growth has been funded by

average balance of loans excluding pci loans increased 64 2 million or 7 1 from 911 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 975 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 interest income on securities

balance increase of 1 1 million year over year in deposits in other banks the primary driver in the increase in income was due to an increase in the return on those balances from 1 35 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 2 36 in the fourth quarter of 2018 interest on pci loans was 1 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 1 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the average balance of the pci portfolio declined 6 1 million during the year over year comparison period interest expense increased 906 000 or 36 1 when comparing the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2018 interest expense on deposits increased 939 000 or 44 3 as the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased 54 1 million or 5 7 the increase in deposit cost was driven by an increase of 11 0

2018 the interest spread was 3 57 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and was 3 56 for the same period in 2017 net interest margin increased despite the stable interest spread because of growth of 13 8

quarter of 2017 and 550 000 for the year ended december 31 2017 the absence of a provision during the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2018 was the direct result of nominal charge offs and

quality is presented below noninterest income linked quarter basis noninterest income was 1 1 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease of 127 000 compared with 1 2 million for the third

beijing january 25 2019 china will take steps to spur growth amid a trade war with the united states but there is limited room for aggressive stimulus in an economy already laden with massive debts and a property market prone to credit driven spikes policy insiders said china s deepening economic slowdown has fanned market expectations of a big spending binge especially if the bruising tariff war with washington escalates intensifying pressure on chinese jobs threatening social stability such a move plans for which have repeatedly been denied by china s top leaders would come at a price however similar moves in the past have quickly juiced growth rates but also buried the world s no 2 economy under a mountain of debt the room for a strong stimulus is not big and there are very big risks because that will rely on a flood of cash and increased leverage in the economy said a policy insider declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter during the 2008 09 global financial crisis beijing rolled out a 4 trillion yuan 591 billion spending package to fight a downturn that cost 20 million jobs in a matters of months quickly reviving growth but also prompting a credit explosion the obsession of china s leaders with stability led to policy easing in 2012 and 2015 a year marked by a stock market crash a slide in the yuan and sharp capital outflows that further pushed up debt levels and inflated home prices authorities have taken a raft of pro growth measures in the past year in the form of cuts to the levels of cash banks must hold as reserves to spur lending tax cuts and efforts to accelerate infrastructure spending still growth in the world s second largest economy weakened to a 28 year low of 6 6 percent in 2018 and is expected to slow further to 6 3 percent this year sources have told reuters that beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6 6 5 percent this year from around 6 5 percent in 2018 some chinese factories have felt the pinch from higher u s tariffs but there are few signs of a sharp rise in unemployment due to a more resilient services sector and a shrinking pool of workers as a result of the country s demographic changes we should be vigilant about employment pressure but it s too early to talk about serious problems said a second policy insider debt risks the current slowdown was caused by china s deleveraging drive in early 2016 which focused on state firms and local governments before broadening to the financial sector a year later a crackdown on shadow lending pushed up borrowing costs and made it harder for small firms to get funds as the trade war increases headwinds beijing s policy focus has been shifted to supporting growth from reining in debt risks although top leaders remain worried about long term systemic risks that could derail the country s economic ascent president xi jinping said this week that china must be on guard against black swan risks meaning unforeseen events that have extreme consequences while fending off so called grey rhino events obvious threats that go ignored data from the bank for international settlements bis showed that china s debt to gross domestic product gdp ratio climbed to 253 percent at the end of june 2018 from 231 percent at end 2015 although the pace of increases is slowing fitch could cut china s a credit rating or stable outlook if beijing reverts to the kind of debt fueled stimulus programs it has used in the past the firm s top sovereign analyst said earlier this month further reductions in banks reserve requirement ratios rrr are expected in coming quarters but the central bank will not rush into cutting benchmark interest rates more aggressive easing could pressure the yuan aggravate high debt levels and even stoke property speculation given that elevated home prices have put strains on consumers if there is too much liquidity we should worry whether it may flow into unintended areas rather than the real economy said a policy adviser no quick boost to growth china is likely to lean more on fiscal pump priming to support the economy this year as the central government has been struggling to channel more credit into small and private firms that are vital for growth and jobs policy insiders said in december top leaders pledged to step up counter cyclical support for the economy and said fiscal policy would be more forceful and effective and monetary policy would be prudent with appropriate tightness and looseness details on the fiscal stimulus are expected to be unveiled during the annual parliamentary meeting in march analysts expect china to deliver tax and fee cuts of 2 trillion yuan in 2019 versus last year s 1 3 trillion yuan and let local governments issue 2 trillion yuan in off budget special bonds to fund key projects up from 1 35 trillion yuan but the economy may not get a quick boost as the raft of policy measures may take time to kick in and china s high debt levels and falling investment returns could slow down spending stimulus won t be very strong and its impact won t be big said one of the policy insiders the manufacturing sector faces all round oversupply while infrastructure investment is saturated in many places projects that have been launched won t make money new tax cuts including lowering the valued added tax vat for firms could give hard pressed small and private firms a shot in the arm and force the government to tighten its belt the finance ministry has pledged a 5 percent cut in general government spending reuters 1 6 7639 chinese yuan renminbi

reserve requirement ratios rrr are expected in coming quarters but the central bank will not rush into cutting benchmark interest rates more aggressive easing could pressure the yuan aggravate high debt levels and even stoke property speculation given that elevated home prices have put strains on consumers if there is too much liquidity we should worry whether it may flow into unintended areas rather than the real economy said a policy adviser no quick boost to growth advertisement china is likely to lean more on fiscal pump priming to support the economy this year as the central government has been struggling to channel more credit into small and private firms that are vital for growth and jobs policy insiders said in december top leaders pledged to step up counter cyclical support for the economy and said fiscal policy would be more forceful and effective and monetary policy would be prudent with appropriate tightness and looseness details on the fiscal stimulus are expected to be unveiled during the annual parliamentary meeting in march analysts expect china to deliver tax and fee cuts of 2 trillion yuan in 2019 versus last year s 1 3 trillion yuan and let local governments issue 2 trillion yuan in off budget special bonds to fund key projects up from 1 35 trillion yuan but the economy may not get a quick boost as the raft of policy measures may take time to kick in and china s high debt levels and falling investment returns could slow down spending advertisement stimulus won t be very strong and its impact won t be big said one of the policy insiders the

advertisement we ll provide some inaudible and we ll then turn the call over to john for a review of our fourth quarter and full year results we will be making forward looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially from our forward looking statements if any of our key assumptions

presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non gaap measures to the closest gaap financial measure with that i will turn the call over to jim james l robo chairman and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thanks matt and good morning everyone as john will detail later in our in the call 2018 was a terrific year for both nextera energy and nextera energy partners by successfully executing on our plans at both fpl and energy resources nextera energy was able to achieve our target 2018 adjusted eps of 7 70 an increase of approximately 15 over our 2017 results dating back to 2005 we ve now delivered compound annual growth in adjusted eps of over 8 5 which is the highest among all top 10 power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of roughly 3 over the same period we delivered a total shareholder return of over 14 in 2018 outperforming the s p 500 by nearly 19 and the s p 500 utilities index by more than 10 since 2005 we ve outperformed 86 of the s p 500 and 100 of the other companies in the s p 500 utilities index while continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one three five seven and 10 year basis we are once again honored to be named for the 12th time in 13 years number 1 in the electric and gas utilities industry on fortune s list of world s most admired companies and to be among the top 25 of fortune s 2018 change the world list during 2018 fpl successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan including a continuation of one of the largest solar expansions ever in the us and achieved its o m efficiency targets to further improve its already best in class customer value proposition as a result of continued smart investments to benefit our customers fpl s typical residential bill is more than 30 below the national average the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the state of florida and nearly 10 below the level it was in 2006 in addition to low bills fpl delivered its best ever service reliability performance in 2018 and was recognized for the third time in four years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation advertisement advertisement throughout the year we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities across the country in their recovery from natural disasters and we remain grateful for the support that others have given us over the years after a nearly 10 year process last month fpl closed on the purchase of the city of vero beach s municipal electric system we look forward to extending fpl s value proposition to vero beach s approximately 35 000 customers while also generating significant long term savings for fpl s existing customers the benefit to both new and existing customers is reflective of fpl s collaborative efforts with city local and regional leaders as well as other state authorities to find the best outcome for all stakeholders earlier this month we were pleased to close on the purchase of gulf power and excited to welcome our new colleagues to the nextera energy family we ve now successfully completed all three transactions with southern company that we announced in the middle of last year the acquisitions are an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand nextera energy s regulated business mix through the addition of attractive electric and natural gas franchises by executing on the same long term strategy that we ve deployed at fpl we expect the acquisitions to benefit customers shareholders and the florida economy the energy resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2018 the renewables origination success was particularly strong as the team added approximately 6 500 megawatts including storage and repowering to our backlog over the past year this represents the most successful origination year in our history and is nearly twice as many megawatts as we originated in 2017 our prior record year our ongoing renewable origination success results from operating in what we believe to be the best renewables development environment in our history and our ability to leverage energy resources competitive advantages these competitive advantages include our best in class development skills strong customer relationships purchasing power best in class construction expertise resource assessment capabilities strong access to and cost of capital advantages and the ability to combine wind solar and battery storage into integrated nearly firm low cost products advertisement advertisement during the year we were pleased to receive the irs started construction guidance on the solar itc which we believe positions us well for substantial solar and storage growth well into the next decade in 2018 more than 40 of the solar projects that were added to our backlog included a battery storage component highlighting the beginning of the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution with continued technology improvements and cost declines we expect that without incentives wind is going to be a 0 02 to 0 025 per kilowatt hour product and solar is going to be a 0 025 to 0 03 per kilowatt hour product early in the next decade combining these extremely low costs with a 0 05 to 0 75 ph adder for a four hour storage system will create a nearly firm renewable generation resource that is cheaper than the operating cost of coal nuclear and less fuel efficient oil and gas fired generation units we continue to believe that this will be massively disruptive to the nation s generation fleet and creates significant opportunities for renewables growth well into the next decade consistent with our focus on growing our rate regulated and long term contracted business operations during the fourth quarter nextera energy transmission announced an agreement to acquire trans bay cable a 53 mile high voltage direct current underwater transmission cable system with utility rates set by ferc which provides approximately 40 of san francisco s daily electric power needs subject to regulatory approvals the approximately 1 billion acquisition including the assumption of debt is expected to close later this year and to be immediately accretive to earnings the proposed acquisition combined with the midcontinent independent system operator selection of nextera energy transmission to develop the approximately 20 miles single circuit 500 kv hartburg sabine junction transmission line in east texas furthers our goal of creating america s leading competitive transmission company in addition to successfully growing our regulated operations both organically and through acquisitions during 2018 we further strengthened energy resources existing portfolio during the year in december the connecticut department of energy and environmental protection selected approximately 20 of the seabrook nuclear plants generation and 80 megawatts of new solar projects which are not yet included in our backlog for long term contracts by operating one of the top performing nuclear plants in the nation energy resources expects to provide significant amounts of carbon free energy at prices generally in line with current forward curves while generating attractive shareholder returns as a result seabrook s contract pricing is expected to be roughly 50 lower than the cost of offshore wind generating significant savings for connecticut customers over the eight year contract term the seabrook award complements energy resources exited the merchant business which we began back in 2011 and essentially completed in 2016 with the sale of our forney lamar and marcus hook natural gas generation assets excluding seabrook the remaining merchant generation assets contribute less than 1 of nextera energy s consolidated adjusted ebitda going forward we expect this contribution to decline as the focus remains on regulated and long term contracted opportunities in renewables natural gas pipelines and regulated transmission advertisement advertisement as always we will continue to opportunistically evaluate recycling capital through sales of non strategic assets in our portfolio including the remaining fossil generation assets to fund the additional growth of the long term contracted businesses as a result of increasing the expected adjusted earnings contribution from rate regulated businesses to roughly 70 and the steps that we ve taken to further derisk the energy resources portfolio s p announced earlier this month that they reside revised their assessment of nextera energy s business risk profile upward from strong to excellent as a result of this improvement s p reduced nextera energy s ffo to debt downgrade threshold from 23 to 21 this follows moody s announcements last year that with the expansion of the company s regulated operations to roughly 70 following the gulf power transaction nextera energy s cfo pre working capital to debt downgrade threshold would be reduced from 20 to 18 at these revised rating agency thresholds and following some utilization of balance sheet capacity for the trans bay transmission acquisition we now expect to maintain billion to 6 billion of excess balance sheet capacity through to 2021 while we have multiple alternatives for utilization we expect to use approximately 2 billion of this capacity in the near term to support additional regulated capital investments at fbl consistent with the significant incremental smart investment opportunities that exist at fpl last week we announced fpl s groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan to install more than 30 million solar panels by 2013 resulting in an incremental 10 000 megawatts of solar projects versus what is in operation at fpl today we will give further details on these and other potential investments which are mostly expected to help maintain our long term adjusted eps compound annual growth rate beyond 2021 at our investor conference which we plan to hold on june 20th in new york city following the strong results from 2018 i continue to believe that we have one of the best organic opportunity sets in execution track records in the industry i remain as enthusiastic as ever about our long term prospects and based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses i will be disappointed if we were not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6 to 8 compound annual growth rate range through 2021 plus the expected yield accretion from the florida transactions while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings let me now turn to nep which also had a terrific year of execution in 2018 as john will describe later in the call nep successfully delivered on its growth objectives for adjusted ebitda cafd and lp distributions during the year we recycled the proceeds from the sale of nep s canadian portfolio into a higher yielding us portfolio that benefits from a more favorable tax position as a result of this accretive transaction nep extended its expectations for 12 to 15 per year dpu growth by one additional year to 2023 the 1 4 gigawatt renewable portfolio that was acquired from energy resources further enhanced the diversity of nep s existing portfolio and was financed through a combination of the canadian asset sale proceeds and a 750 million convertible equity portfolio financing with blackrock the financing demonstrates nep s ability to excess to access additional low cost sources of capital to finance its growth and with the right to convert a minimum of 70 of the portfolio financing into nep units issued at no discount the transaction further reduces nep s equity needs going forward advertisement advertisement nep grew the lp distribution by 15 year over year and delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 4 in 2018 which is on the heels of a total unitholder return of over 75 the year prior nep outperformed both the s p 500 and the other yield curves by 7 on average and its total unitholder return was more than 15 higher than the alerian mlp index i continue to believe that the combination of nep s growth visibility along with its flexibility to finance that growth offer unitholders an attractive invest offer unitholders an attractive investor value proposition for these reasons nep is well positioned to continue executing on its growth objectives and delivering strong performance going forward before turning the call over to john i d like to announce some important organizational changes armando pimentel president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources and president and a member of the board of directors of nextera energy partners will retire from each of these positions on march 1 of this year as part of a planned leadership succession process that began when armando shared his plans with me more than a year ago john ketchum currently executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy will replace armando as president and chief executive officer at nextera energy resources as part of john s new responsibilities he will continue to serve as a member of the board of directors of nep and will be appointed president of nextera energy partners rebecca kujawa currently vice president of business management in nextera energy resources will succeed john as executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy rebecca will also become a member of the board of directors of nep each of these changes will become effective on march 1 of this year armando has been an enormous contributor to nextera energy s success during his more than 10 years with the company helping to build an industry leading business during his tenure as ceo of energy resources his leadership his commercial judgment his financial discipline have all guided energy resources through a period of truly unprecedented growth and financial success armando s contribution set the company on a path to become what it is today the world s leading renewable energy company he s been a great friend colleague and a truly valued counselor to me personally and it s an understatement to say i ll miss him but i am also excited for armando and what will come next for him and his family in retirement with regard to john s promotion i ve had the chance to work closely with john for more than 16 years as he has successfully progressed through a variety of different roles in our company we re fortunate to have a person of his capability vision and experience he s an exceptional leader who s emerged as one of the premier cfos in our sector and i have tremendous faith that john is the ideal successor to lead the energy resources team into the future due to his strong financial acumen knowledge of the sector and passion for building a world leading energy company advertisement advertisement likewise rebecca has distinguished herself as a well rounded executive with a proven track record of execution outstanding finance and commercial skills and an unparalleled understanding of nextera energy of the nextera energy enterprise she s been instrumental in helping armando lead energy resources and develop our strategy for nep over the last several years and here in her innovative analytical and strategic mindset will serve us well in her new role i m very happy to have rebecca as our new chief financial officer i ll now turn the call call over to armando who d like to make some personal remarks armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc thank you jim first i want to thank jim for providing me the opportunity to lead energy resources for the 7 5 years and i want to thank those of you on the phone today who i ve had the privilege of meeting and interacting with since i began at nextera energy in 2008 i thank you for the interactive dialog and the opportunity to continue to tell our story and today there is no doubt that energy resources is not only the largest developer operator and owner of renewable energy in the world but also it s most profitable and innovative and as i tell our employees and customers i believe we are just getting started advertisement advertisement i strongly believe that the renewable energy opportunity is actually just beginning the combination of energy storage with wind and solar is a revolution which will expand the opportunities for renewables and is very exciting and profoundly comfortable in the continued success of energy resources nextera energy partners and nextera energy i want to thank all of our employees at nextera energy for providing me the opportunity to work alongside them i have learned and laughed much over the years and will miss the innovative fast paced environment in which we work i have no concrete plans as of now but i am excited about pursuing new adventures and honing old skills at the very least retirement will allow me to pursue one of my great passions fishing thanks

deserved i will now turn the call over to john john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you armando and jim let s now turn to the detailed results beginning with fpl for the fourth quarter of 2018 fpl reported net income of 407 million or 0 85 per share up 0 01 per share compared to fpl s adjusted earnings in the prior year period for the full year 2018 fpl reported net income of 2 2 billion or 4 55 per share an increase of 0 46 per share versus fpl s adjusted earnings in 2017 regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 12 4 for 2018 and was a principal driver of fpl s adjusted net income growth of 12 5 for the full year fpl s capital expenditures were approximately 1 5 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly 5 1 billion fpl s reported roe for regulatory purposes was 11 6 for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9 6 to 11 6 under our current rate agreement during the fourth quarter we restored an additional 240 million of reserve amortization leaving fpl with a year end 2018 balance of 541 million we continue to expect that fpl will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years creating further customer benefits by potentially avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and perhaps 2022 before moving on let me now take a moment to update you on some of our key capital initiatives at fpl during 2018 fpl completed construction on schedule and on budget for the first eight 74 5 megawatt solar energy centers developed under the solar base rate adjustment or sobra mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement in 2018 we also deployed the first two projects under fpl s 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program pairing battery systems with existing solar projects and highlighting fpl s innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of its clean energy solutions for customers the next 300 megawatts of solar projects being built under the sobra mechanism remain on budget and on track to begin providing cost effective energy to fpl customers in early 2019 to support the significant solar expansion that fpl is leading across florida we have secured sites that could potentially support more than 7 gigawatts of future projects beyond solar construction on the approximately 1750 megawatt okeechobee clean energy center remains on budget and on schedule to enter service in the middle of this year additionally the roughly 1200 megawatt dania beach clean energy center received siting board approval during the quarter to support its projected commercial operation date in 2022 we continue to expect that fpl s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate in regulatory capital employed net of accumulated deferred income taxes of approximately 9 from the start of the settlement agreement in january 2017 through at least december 2021 while further enhancing our customer value proposition the economy in florida remains healthy the current unemployment rate of 3 3 remains below the national average and at the lowest levels in a decade florida s consumer confidence level remains near 10 year highs the real estate sector also continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at healthy levels and the case shiller index for south florida home prices up 4 8 from the prior year fpl s fourth quarter retail sales increased 4 from the prior year comparable period we estimate that weather related usage per customer contributed approximately 0 6 to this amount on a weather normalized basis fourth quarter sales increased 3 4 with positive contributions from both weather normalized usage per customer and ongoing customer growth including the addition of vero beach s customers for 2018 we estimate that fpl s retail sales on a weather normalized basis increased by 2 6 continued customer growth and an estimated 1 7 increase in weather normalized usage per customer both contributed favorably while we are encouraged by the growth and underlying usage in 2018 which was a consistent benefit during all four quarters as we have often discussed this measure can be volatile and we are not yet ready to draw any firm conclusions about long term trends we will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and we ll update you on future calls let me now turn to energy resources which reported fourth quarter 2018 gaap earnings of 263 million or 0 55 per share adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were 317 million or 0 66 per share for the full year energy resources reported gaap earnings of 4 66 billion or 9 75 per share and adjusted earnings of 1 46 billion or 3 05 per share in the fourth quarter energy resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share increased by 0 18 from the prior year comparable period positive contributions from new investments customer supply and trading our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines and the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate all supported the strong year over year growth these favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our existing generation assets as a result of particularly poor fleetwide wind resource which was the lowest fourth quarter on record over the last 30 years and higher interest in corporate expenses due to growth in the business energy resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased 0 45 or approximately 17 versus 2017 for the full year contributions from the new investments declined by 0 04 per share due in part to the expected smaller than usual 2017 renewable bill for 2019 and beyond we expect meaningful growth from new investments as we continue to execute on our renewables development backlog increased ptc volume from approximately 1600 megawatts of repowered wind projects that were commissioned in 2017 helped to increase contributions from existing generation assets by 0 10 per share contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines increased by 0 17 per share year over year as expected the reduction of corporate federal income tax rate was accretive to energy resources increasing adjusted eps by 0 45 compared to 2017 all other impacts reduced results by 0 23 per share primarily as a result of higher interest and corporate expenses driven largely by increased development activity to support the favorable renewables development environment additional details are shown on the accompanying slide in 2018 energy resources continued to advance its position as a leading developer and operator of wind solar and battery storage projects commissioning nearly 2700 megawatts of new renewable projects in the us including an additional 900 megawatts of repowered wind since the last call we have added 1791 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog including 680 megawatts of wind 797 megawatts of solar and 215 megawatts of battery storage all of which will be paired with new solar projects included in the solar megawatts we added to backlog this quarter is a 150 megawatt solar build own transfer project with a 10 year o m agreement that will allow the customer to leverage energy resources best in class operating skills while providing meaningful ongoing revenue through the contract term during the quarter energy resources signed an additional 99 megawatts of wind repowering and successfully commissioned approximately 600 megawatts of repowering projects for 2017 and 2018 this brings the total repowering projects placed in service to roughly 2500 megawatts near the top end of the previously outlined range for this period we continue to expect to be in the upper half of the 2 5 billion to 3 billion in total capital deployment for repowering for 2017 through 2020 following the record origination year in 2018 and with nearly two years remaining in the development period we are now within the previously outlined 2017 to 2020 ranges for us wind solar and wind repowering for the post 2020 period our backlog is already nearly 2000 megawatts placing us well ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage the accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands beyond renewables we completed a construction of approximately 175 miles of the mountain valley pipeline during 2018 as planned mvp is continuing with its scaled back construction efforts for the winter while we continue to target our previously announced full in service date for the pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2019 and a revised overall project cost estimate of 44 6 billion we also continue to work through the project s outstanding legal challenges and to closely monitor developments related to the atlantic coast pipeline and the current government shutdown as the outcome of any one of these issues could impact mvp s project schedule and cost estimate we also continue to evaluate mitigation alternatives to address potential adverse outcomes should they arise mvp s expected annual contribution to nextera energy s ongoing adjusted eps is approximately 0 07 to 0 09 we do not expect any material adjusted earnings impacts nor any change in nextera energy s financial expectations as a result of the ongoing challenges we ll provide further updates as those proceedings evolve turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy for the fourth quarter of 2018 gaap net income attributable to the nextera energy was 422 million or 0 88per share nextera energy s 2018 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were 718 million or 1 49 per share respectively for the full year 2018 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 6 64 billion or 13 08 per share adjusted earnings were 3 67 billion or 7 70 or per share reflecting growth of 15 off our 2017 adjusted eps including approximately 0 45 benefit from lower federal income taxes for the corporate and other segment adjusted earnings for the full year increased 0 09 per share compared to 2017 primarily due to lower interest and certain favorable tax items we continue to expect nextera energy s adjusted eps compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6 to 8 through 2021 off our 2018 adjusted eps of 7 70 plus accretion of 0 15 and 0 20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the florida acquisitions for 2019 we continue to expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of 8 to 8 50 from 2018 to 2021 we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we are closely following the recent developments with pacific gas and electric projects directly affected by the potential pg e bankruptcy have an expected annual adjusted eps contribution of roughly 0 13 to 0 15 for nextera energy regardless of the outcome of pg e s anticipated bankruptcy proceedings we expect to achieve nextera energy s adjusted eps expectations that i just outlined and we ll be disappointed if we are not able to deliver growth at or near the top of our 6 to 8 compound annual growth rate range off our 2018 base of 7 70 plus the expected deal accretion from the florida transactions we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12 to 14 per year through at least 2020 off a 2017 base of dividends per share of 3 93 as always our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions let me now turn to nep which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2018 yesterday the nep board declared a quarterly distribution of 46 50 per common unit or 1 86 per unit on an annualized basis up 15 from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2018 for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda and cafd increased to 18 and 36 respectively primarily as a result of portfolio growth in addition to meeting neps growth objectives with the acquisition from energy resources during 2018 we were also pleased to announce the execution of a long term contract that enables an expansion investment in the texas pipelines the opportunity which is subject to regulatory approvals is expected to be in service during the fourth quarter of 2020 demonstrates the organic growth potential of nep s underlying portfolio beyond the attractive low cost convertible portfolio equity financing of blackrock nep took additional steps to further enhance its financial financing flexibility during 2018 in the fourth quarter nep entered into an additional 1 billion interest rate hedge agreement to help mitigate interest rate volatility on future debt issuances nep s hedge agreement has a fixed rate of approximately 3 95 and can be flexibly utilized at any date until december 11th 2028 the swap is incremental to the 5 billion hedge agreement that we announced last year providing significant protection against interest rate risk and npe executes on it s long term growth plan as nep executes on its long term growth plan additionally during 2018 we successfully raised approximately 85 million through the sale of roughly 1 8 million ph common units under nep s atm program going forward we will continue to flexibly seek opportunities to use the atm program depending on market conditions and other considerations now let s look at the detailed results fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 165 million and cash available for distribution was 44 million a decrease of 35 million and 33 million from the prior year comparable quarter respectively the decline was primarily driven by the sale of the canadian portfolio earlier in the year with those assets not replaced until the late december closing on the 1 4 gigawatt acquisition from energy resources for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda and cafd were 881 million and 339 million up 18 and 36 respectively primarily driven by growth of the underlying portfolio existing projects benefited from increased contributions from texas pipelines versus the prior year for adjusted ebitda this benefit was offset by the year over year reduction in the pre tax value of nep s tax credits as a result of the decline in the federal income tax rate this change has no income no impact on cafd cash available for distribution from existing projects also benefited from reduced debt service which was roughly offset by higher corporate level interest expense as a reminder these results include the impact of idr fees which we treat as an operating expense additional details are shown on the accompanying slide for nep absent any impact from a pg e bankruptcy filing our december 31 2018 run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda of 1 billion to 1 15 billion and cafd of 360 million to 400 million are unchanged reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the portfolio with which we ended the year our previously announced december 31 2019 run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda of 1 2 billion to 1 375 billion and cafd of 410 million to 480 million are also unchanged our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense from an updated base of our fourth quarter 2018 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of a 1 86 we continue to see 12 to 15 per year growth in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023 we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2019 distribution that is payable in february 2020 to be in a range of 2 08 to 2 14 per common unit nep expects to be able to manage through the impacts of the anticipated pg e bankruptcy and to achieve the growth expectations that i just outlined as we have previously disclosed the 420 megawatts of projects that are contracted with pg e represent 15 to 18 of nep s expected year end 2018 run rate cash available for distribution as a result of the pg e board of directors authorizing the commencement of a bankruptcy filing we believe an event of default has likely occurred under the genesis financing the administrative agent for the desert sunlight 300 financing has notified and said an event of default has occurred under those agreements which we dispute and they are currently withholding the january distribution for any financing where an event of default is determined to have occurred cash distributions can be restricted and other remedies could be exercised including acceleration of the debt additionally due to provisions in the financings an event of default under the desert sunlight 300 financing can prevent distributions from desert sunlight 250 which is contracted with sce we expect the combination of desert sunlight 250 and the pg e projects to contribute roughly 18 of nep s year end 2019 run rate cafd as we execute on nep s growth strategy we expect this to further decline over time and that the pg e projects and desert sunlight 250 will not represent a significant percentage of nep s 2023 cash available for distribution for projects where cash distributions are restricted we expect that over time these funds will go toward paying down the principal on existing financings which would potentially result in more distributable cash flows to nep in the future in each of these projects we are reviewing our alternatives and we ll pursue all options to protect our interests including vigorously defending our contracts and working with key stakeholders of each financing even in a worst case scenario where we receive no further contributions from projects that are contracted with pg e or desert sunlight 250 we continue to expect that nep will achieve its annual 12 to 15 growth and distributions per unit through 2023 without the need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest other than modest at the market issuances we are pleased with nep s strong performance in 2018 and believe it continues to provide a best in class investor value proposition with the flexibility to grow in three ways acquiring assets from energy resources organically or acquiring assets from other third parties nep has clear visibility to support its growth going forward following a new record renewables origination year by energy resources and the continued strength of the best renewables development environment in our history nep s growth visibility further improved in 2018 additionally nep s cost to capital and access to capital advantages further improved over the past year providing flexibility to finance its growth over the long term when nep s growth potential and financing flexibility are combined with its favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights we believe nep is well positioned to meet its financial expectations and we look forward to delivering on nep s strategic and growth initiatives in 2019 and beyond that concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions questions and answers operator speaker o operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and we ll go first to stephen byrd of morgan stanley stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst hi good morning armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc hi good morning stephen stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst armando congratulations on your retirement and john and rebecca congratulations on your new role all very well deserved armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc thank you stephen stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst i wanted to just talk as you can imagine about california for a minute if all of the project debt essentially withheld cash to the arguably to the extent that they were would be permitted i wanted to make sure i was clear how much cafd would be restricted you mentioned 18 related to several projects but i wanted to check if every single piece of debt relating to pg e sort of exercised their cash cash trap right what amount of cafd would be impacted john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so again it would comprise roughly 18 of our run rate cafd for 2019 we have included a page in our investor materials that details page 41 page 41 that details the cafd from each of these projects totals about 90 million stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst understood john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer so let s go back though to what i just said which is that first of all even if all of that cash is trapped we expect to be able to meet our financial expectations 12 to 15 growth in distributions per unit through 2023 we expect we will not have a need to issue common equity until 2020 at the earliest so our financial expectations are not impacted by any means while the second the impact of pg e and sce cash flows is going to diminish over time so by the time we get to the end of the period of our financial expectations the cash flows from these projects is not going to be significant a significant contributor to the overall cafd and then i think you have to take a look too stephen at the at what is happening in california i mean obviously we are not going to sit on our heels we re going to pursue all avenues with our note holders to try to to try to free up that cash and we ll work vigorously to do that as i said in the prepared remarks stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst that all makes sense and john in terms of any exposure to other california utilities i m thinking of the edison international and sempra just wanted to check both at nep and nextera would you mind just speaking briefly to your other california exposure armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah so on our on our other california exposure with sce i mean right now we don t have any because there s none of those financings are in default other than the sce contract that i mentioned which is about 250 megawatts on desert sunlight because that s part of a portfolio financing but again the impacts of that are included in the numbers that i gave you earlier so the 250 impact is included in the 0 13 to 0 15 at nextera energy it is also included in the roughly 18 of total cafd for 2019 stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst okay but do you have any cafd exposure not in default but does where are the offtaker is a subsidiary of either edison international or sempra armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc no zero stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst okay armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc at nep at nep stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst okay great just wanted to check armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc zero stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst at nep okay and at nextera is that significant or is it relatively small armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc it s relatively small i mean the contributions that we would have from sce contracts are roughly 0 08 and that includes the desert sunlight 250 so without without it it s about 0 06 so small stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst understood sorry for all the questions on california maybe just one last one you filed at burke to sort of secure your legal rights under the contracts would you mind just to kind of briefly talk in through your legal arguments around ensuring that you protect your rights under your contracts armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah i mean the bottom line is we think a majority those contracts have inaudible provisions and that these contracts are in the public interest and that the federal power act pre empts what the bankruptcy court can do and if and they forecast the final say on assumption or rejection stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst that s very good that s all i have thank you very much operator we will now go to our next question and that will come from steve fleishman of wolfe research steve fleishman wolfe research analyst yeah good morning so just first on the nep plan i assume your embedded in there you re assuming that you can continue to get financing other than equity i assume including some of the like private financings converts and such that you ve gotten in the past how do you feel about the ability to get those with this california uncertainty john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer first of all on the finances like the blackrock financing still feel good about our ability to be able to execute against those types of financings and again we also have a lot of debt capacity at npe that we can always fall back on as well steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay and then just separate question off topic could you update your interest thoughts and interest in santee cooper james l robo chairman and chief executive officer yeah thanks steve this is jim we we did put a proposal in to acquire santee cooper i think i ve been very clear that we have been interested in pursuing santee cooper over the last 18 months or so and we did put a proposal in to to acquire it and we look forward to the next steps of the process that the committee is going to be going through steve fleishman wolfe research analyst do you have any idea when you ll get an answer james l robo chairman and chief executive officer i think this is a process that ultimately has to if the legislature decides to sell santee cooper it s going to have to actually pass a law to do so essentially and the legislative session ends at the end of may or june in that time period so it s going to play out over the next several months is the bottom line steve steve fleishman wolfe research analyst armando best to you thank you armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc thanks steve operator and now we will go to julien dumoulin smith of bank of america merrill lynch julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning congrats armando can you hear me armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah thanks julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst good well just one quick clarification on the ferc strategy under nep and then i ll move away from it but just if there is indeed some kind of stay how does that impact the technical default and the possibility of distribution so i want to clarify that or cash and pg e for that matter armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah from a ferc standpoint if there were a ferc well first of all if ferc were to grant the relief that we re seeking by the end of the week i mean i think it just would grant ferc the final say in what happens to the contract so i don t think it really has any impact on the status of the existing finances julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it okay fair enough excellent and then i just want to turn back to fpl real quickly specifically on the last call you talked about having shall we say adequate reserve amortization you also talk about usage trends et cetera and the ability to potentially avoid base rate increases in 21 and 22 where does that stand now how if at all is that impacted by some of the latest events just curious on how you re positioning fpl into the longer term here armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah i don t think it s impacted by any of the current events we feel very good very good about our position in front of the opc if that julian was what you were referring to as other events we ve ended the year julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst or maybe being more specific were you expecting to pen something more formal about further rates there armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc well here s where we are right now we have 540 million of surplus and in the year we have we believe and expect to have enough surplus to potentially stay out of a rate case for 21 and 22 we will make those strategic rate case decisions later but we have a lot of flexibility and that flexibility is very good for florida customers because the longer we are able to stay out the longer period of time that that bills stay where they are and they don t see a bill impact from another rate case james l robo chairman and chief executive officer hey julien this is jim i think you can expect us to give you all some more thoughts on that front in the june investor conference julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent and then maybe jim this is a quick question to your direction but as you think kind of conceptually especially given the commitments from the last analyst day around midstream potentially some of the latest developments you ve already alluded to around renewables especially some of the rpf expansions that might be coming in the next six months prior to the june analyst day could you give us a little bit of your latest thought process around your future investment prospects just a little bit more holistically james l robo chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure i mean when you look at our capital investment plans i think they are over 12 billion this year when you look at what we re doing at fpl gulf and energy resources combined something in that range we are as of as of the year before last we don t have the details yet on last year we were the fourth largest investor of capital in the united states in any industry only at t verizon and amazon invested more in this country than we did in terms of capital investment and we are going to continue to do what we have done for more than a decade which is invest smart capital at fpl to improve the value proposition for customers and we re going to we re very excited about and we ll have more to say about what we re doing at gulf in our june meeting but we ve hit the ground running very excited about what we re doing in terms of what investment prospects there are on the gulf front and we re moving aggressively forward on that pretty much on day one and at energy resources it is the best renewable environment that we ve ever seen and we are going to continue to invest in renewables going forward and as we see pipeline opportunities contract and pipeline opportunities we ll continue to invest in those as well so i don t think you should expect a big change in our thinking in june i think you ll just see us frankly roll forward our vision for the amount of investment and the amount of customer improvement that we re going to bring to our customers as well as the amount of what we re gonna do in terms of earnings going forward julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst i ll leave it there thank you very much john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thanks julien operator we will now go to greg gordon of evercore isi greg gordon evercore isi analyst congratulations to all three of you goes without saying you re all terrific at your jobs and armando someone asked me to ask you if you could get circle back with people and tell us where you like to fish that would be good now that you re going to have multiple speakers armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc that s coming greg gordon evercore isi analyst a couple of questions can you just go back over what you said about the levelized cost of energy for battery with storage and what i m particularly interested other than just a restatement of that is what delivery year you see that crossover happening on sort of a large enough scale to tip this sort of disruptive transition that you re you re talking about armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yes so what we covered in jim s remarks we ll start with the wind so wind we are expecting to be right around 20 25 a megawatt hour i d kind of put that wraps and ptc helping there this is a no incentive look so call it when those incentives expire more toward the middle of the decade that 2024 time frame so 20 25 megawatt for wind and we think batteries are going to be about a 0 05 to 0 075 adder and so that s how we were able to i m sorry per megawatt that s how we re able to get to the ranges that jim provided for wind so just take the 20 plus the 20 25 add on 0 05 to 0 075 ph for battery storage for solar don t forget we have the solar itc at 30 through the end of 2023 and so when those itcs go away and they don t ever go away right they go from 30 to 10 we are expecting that we solar given how quickly panel costs are coming down balance of plant costs are coming down solar is a product we re going to be selling in the 25 megawatt hour to 30 megawatt hour range and then the same adders for batteries is how you get to the math that were in were in jim s remarks and those are the expectations we have and solar pricing isn t really all that far off from what we re doing today so that s not much of a leap of faith greg gordon evercore isi analyst yeah that makes sense i appreciate it and last question you didn t mention it explicitly anywhere in your comments but the balance sheet capacity of 5 billion to 7 billion i mean your credit metrics and the position on the balance sheet seems unchanged from last quarter so i would assume that you still feel like that balance sheet capacity is in place john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah gordon greg one of the things that we ve said there is that we had 5 billion to 7 billion right we bought trans bay there was a 1 billion so we took that down call it 4 billion to 6 billion and we re earmarking probably another 2 billion of capex opportunities for fpl we ll update what where exactly that will be used at our june conference but certainly some of that money is going to go toward the 30 by 30 initiative that we already announced earlier last week greg gordon evercore isi analyst got you great update thank you guys operator we now will go to michael lapides of goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys obviously armando congrats on your announcement and to the rest of the team to john and rebecca as well great to see people move around and getting new opportunities one question about florida ballot initiative that is being pushed right now can you just talk about what is actually in that ballot initiative what it would mean if it were to garner the votes and what s the process from here john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah i m going to turn that question over to eric eric silagy president and chief executive officer florida power light company hi michael how are you doing today michael lapides goldman sachs analyst great eric thanks for taking this eric silagy president and chief executive officer florida power light company yeah no problem the ballot initiative it s been famous about helping florida customers it s not about their law when you look at it it s really about furthering the business interests of a few folks including a retail electric provider that s located and based out gainesville that markets power currently outside of florida this is group they tried on successfully to get this proposal in front of voters through the constitution revision commission and also through the inaudible where they tried two legislation in tallahassee their efforts have been unsuccessful in the past because frankly florida s regulated electricity market works really well it s our when you look at the state the power prices are among the lowest in the nation with electricity that s among the cleanest and most reliable in the country as an example florida power light offers our customers bills that more than 30 lower than the national average lower than bills in 45 states and as john said earlier we re just recognized third time in four years as the most reliable electric provider in the country which as you can appreciate in a state like this is important when our customers need us most particularly during times of storms and hurricanes so plain and simply it s a proposal that just it actually will lead to increases in electric rates across the state reduce reliability particularly during periods of storms hurricanes things of that nature and i think it s going to compromise the clean energy goals that have been announced including the one we just did on fpl s 30 by 30 initiative as the unregulated power producers would they d have no restrictions on the type of generation that they would build also i think it s important to understand on these type of things that consumer projections are removed you no longer have florida public service commission role in determining what rates are they would no longer be viewed as being just and reasonable if that s the standard it would go out the window and that s going to impact reliability as well the ability of customers this language would actually prohibit customers from being able to buy power from the existing utilities so florida power light customers would not be able to continue to be customers of florida power light there s some other areas too that i think is receiving a lot of focus on including the fact that franchise fees which we collect and pay to municipalities across the state would be eliminated and that is significant amount of revenue that would no longer be available to pay for things like first responders firefighters police hospital employees these municipalities that everybody counts on even you look at now attorney generals and a number of other states have called for the end of deregulation due to all of the consumer complaints and the deceptive trade practices so there s a lot of reasons why these proposals have failed across the country since frankly the early 2000s you look at including even recently in nevada where it failed there s when you look at other states that looked at this a lot of them backed away particularly after the california crisis there and when enron moved in to california to take advantage of their so called market based model which was ultimately the catalyst for that crisis and helped contribute to the state having some of the highest power prices in the country so i don t think it s by accident that there hasn t been a state of fast deregulation since the california power crisis which occurred now nearly 20 years ago so there s a number of hurdles to answer your question they have to be cleared for this proposal to go forward to be placed on the ballot we re going to be very actively engaged we re going to be educating floridians on the true motives of the special interest groups and we re going to also spend a lot of time educating folks on the significant negative impacts that this failed idea would have on the state and on their pocketbooks michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you eric i appreciate that i have one other for either jim john or armando when you re and this is more longer term when you re watching what s happening in california with pg e with edison international or so inaudible and put california in the context of being the nation s largest renewable market and with the most aggressive renewable target how do you think this impacts the broader u s development over renewables if one of the largest markets is going through some turmoil and how do you think about that kind of longer term armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc so it s great question michael i think one of the first thing i d say is california has some very aggressive renewable targets and some very aggressive climate change goals the turmoil around the credit of the most important counterparties in the state is to say the least is not conducive to continued capital investment to continue to further those goals and so i think it s a from an energy policy standpoint in the state of california it s going to be very important for the state to recognize that and to recognize that there s been significant capital investment by companies from around the world to make that happen and to the extent to that that investment is somehow diminished by these credit issues i think that s going to have a real impact on their market going forward and i think the state understands that and it s one of the elements of the things that they re grappling with now as they deal with the fallout from the tragic fires as well as some of the other issues that they ve been facing so the good news from a market standpoint is california was obviously the biggest market in the country 10 years ago in the renewable business it isn t anymore it s an important market but it s no longer the most important market in the country and with the cost declines in renewables nearly every state in the country is in the we have an opportunity to do business i mean we have my last count we have development going on in 48 states right now we don t have operating projects in 48 states but we have development going on in 48 states so while i think it s very important for the state to address these issues from a climate change standpoint going forward i think the renewable market is going to be robust going forward because it is just gotten so big and the cost declines have expanded the market to such a dramatic fashion operator and with that we ll go now to jonathan arnold of deutsche bank jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my question armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc hey good morning jonathan jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst quick question on this is as i think about you talked about managing through the situation at nep in context of the growth rate so as we think about things you might do that would fall under that header you mentioned pushing to have the cash released and i guess you could drop down other assets more quickly you could let the dividend drift down in the range and still be within 12 to 15 ph is there anything else that i m missing and which of those kind of alternatives would you either be planning to use or not use armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc yeah i think i d go first of all back to the prior one of the prior questions about are there other attractive financing vehicles available one yes we think there are but two even if we had the finance additional drops to meet our financial expectations with existing debt capacity that we have we can do that we re fine and so really the way i would answer that question is that obviously we ll vigorously try to negotiate something with the holders that would allow us to and the doe don t forget the doe is in all of is in these projects that would allow us to free up the cash we can t do that we have debt capacity plenty of debt capacity at nep energy resources is coming off the best development year in its history we have very clear visibility to growth prospects going forward and there are many levers in the vehicle so we are comfortable in our ability to manage through even a worst case scenario which would be where the cash is trapped until a final call is made on the contract jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay but john just you ve i think to be clear you ve said in some of them the cash is trapped just by virtue of pg e saying that it may file is that correct and yeah just curious john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah multiple speakers get into the technicalities but one of the financings has a provision that basically just says if there s corporate action taken in furtherance of a bankruptcy which our lawyers view the filing of the 8 k to be that that would constitute potentially constitute an event of default jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst so that was just on one of them john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer that s on the genesis financing jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay and then what would john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer it s on some of it s on some of the other nee financings but the nee financings are small it s a series of four or five projects that don t have any meaningful contribution to earnings at nee jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst so there would be a sort of a judgment as to what would definitively constitute that not occurring presumably john ketchum executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah i mean it doesn t happen then i think it s back to business as usual armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc jonathan let me just add just let me add something i mean obviously i think it s appropriate for the focus on the pg e assets and the cash flows but we still have at both at nextera energy resources and the nextera energy partners we still have a lot of projects that are not pg e southern california edison projects that have significant cash flows and there are still many parties that are interested in attractive financings attractive for us and presumably for them that we re talking to and it s not necessarily about what s the risk of pg e in southern california edison it s about hey what other assets are available for us to be able to enter into those types of financing so i think while it s appropriate to have some focus on what s going on with pg e we got to remember that nextera energy resources has had its we had 6600 megawatts of origination this year which is a record year and that s twice the amount we had last year which was a record year and i got to tell you we feel at least internally very comfortable as john said that even if these pg e cash flows are tied up in these debt financings that we can meet our current expectations and one of the reasons that we feel that way is because we re talking to the market and two origination is going very well in energy resources jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst great that s helpful perspective thank you armando and then could i just one other thing inaudible with the gulf and florida acquisitions having closed sooner i think than maybe you thought is there but you re not talking of any accretion in 19 that would just sort of help us understand the bump in 20 what s driving that and why nothing this year armando pimentel president and chief executive officer nextera energy resources llc so jonathan obviously we got it done a little earlier than we thought but we also always assume that we d have some cost to achieve this year to get there so we re being conservative as we always are and we feel very good about our plans at gulf and you can bet i m pushing the team very hard to get things done even faster than we ve laid out and so i m really optimistic about the future for gulf in this company and our ability to bring real value to their customers and real value to shareholders so very excited about it we ll have more to talk about it in june but remember we don t have any cost to achieve in any of these numbers in 19 jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay thank you very much operator and with that ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today s conference we want to thank you again for attending today s presentation duration 76 minutes call participants matthew roskot director of investor relations

stocks finished the week on a high note as cautious optimism from earlier in the week ended with solid gains buying momentum continued amid news of a deal to temporarily reopen the u s government positive commentary from the administration on the u s china trade front and a report that the fed may keep more bonds in its portfolio than previously thought the administration and congress struck a deal to end the partial government shutdown for three weeks while the funding is only temporary and the jury is still out on a final deal lawmakers have taken a concrete step on the path to resolving the issue the announcement confirmed hopes that had helped the market rise in morning trading and comes as companies have increasingly been voicing worries about the shutdown costing them money or having the potential to the market also gained support after treasury secretary steven mnuchin told reuters that the united states and china were making a lot of progress on talks to end the ongoing trade war that has sparked worries about global economic growth and weighed heavily on companies outlooks his comments served as a counterpoint to less optimistic talk from commerce secretary wilbur ross this was the fifth straight week of gains for the dow jones industrial average dji marking a solid start to the new year fed s bond portfolio in focus meanwhile the wall street journal reported that fed officials are closer to ending the central bank s bond portfolio wind down it said officials are near a decision to maintain a bigger portfolio than they had thought when they started shrinking those holdings two years ago while the fed s interest rate hike trajectory has been closely scrutinized the unwinding of its balance sheet has also been a form of hawkish monetary policy so the market appears to be interpreting the news of the fed potentially keeping a larger balance sheet as bullish when the fed lets more bonds onto the market that tends to weigh on bond prices which then causes yields to rise and increases borrowing costs the central bank bought the bonds as part of its quantitative easing program designed to stimulate the economy by pushing up bond prices and lowering yields which kept borrowing costs lower tech rally continues tech stocks performed well again on friday with the tech heavy nasdaq comp outperforming the two other main u s indices this capped a week of generally solid performance among tech companies after mostly strong economic reports set up the sector nicely ahead of expected earnings reports next week from apple inc aapl and

social media giant in an opinion piece in the wall street journal saying the company doesn t sell users data on friday western digital corp s wdc shares gained ground even though it reported adjusted earnings that missed expectations as the company told investors its revenue would improve later this year earlier in the week xilinx inc xlnx lam research corporation lrcx and texas instruments incorporated txn reported better than expected earnings helping to boost the phlx semiconductor sector index sox a notable exception to the solid performance from the tech sector this week was intel corporation intc which reported quarterly revenue and a q1 earnings outlook that were short of analyst expectations fed meeting on deck the fed is scheduled to conclude its two day january meeting on wednesday based on futures market activity it looks like investors and traders are expecting the central bank to stand pat on interest rates that would jibe with recent commentary from fed officials that policy makers can be patient with any potential rate hikes because inflation is tame still it could be interesting to try to read the tea leaves in the language accompanying the fed s interest rate decision investors may be looking for clues as to the fed s thinking on the impact of the ongoing trade war with china as well as what monetary policy officials make of any lingering effects of the partial government shutdown and the potential for economic damage if it resumes one effect that the shutdown has had is to delay economic data that means the fed like company executives investors analysts and economists has been flying partially blind when it comes to making data dependent decisions economic data and earnings one big report that investors likely won t be seeing on time is the government s first estimate of q4 gross domestic product the gdp reports are among the biggest economic data news events for investors and traders but even with the temporary government reopening they will likely have to wait given the length of the shutdown how long employees have been furloughed and how long it takes to cobble together the gdp report from other data sets that are also incomplete because of the shutdown while the gdp report leaves a big hole in the economic data calendar investors are scheduled to still have plenty to chew on notable economic reports next week include indexes on consumer confidence and manufacturing as well as the monthly nonfarm payrolls report that last one is likely to be especially closely watched as the labor market is a key barometer for economic health and average hourly earnings form an important part of inflation expectations as if investors didn t already have enough on their plate there is a slate of major companies reporting quarterly results in coming days those include caterpillar inc cat which has been closely watched as a barometer for global growth potential amid the continued trade dispute between china and the united states boeing co ba results are also on tap the world s largest aircraft manufacturer has warned that the government shutdown could end up hurting its business as well as that of the overall airline industry so it could be interesting to see whether company executives discuss this further especially in light of friday s news of a temporary reopening other major companies on tap next week include at t inc

been above 20 earlier in the week amid concerns about global economic data and a possible u s china impasse on trade still with all these earnings and a fed meeting coming up it seems unlikely that vix would come down much further anytime soon the dollar also lost a bit of ground friday falling nearly 1 by the close to below 96 the dollar might have seen some pressure from that wall street journal article about the fed s potential balance sheet plans a weaker dollar if it continues could be another boost for u s stocks as it can help make prices for u s goods more attractive abroad the

lines with a bevy of large companies reporting quarterly results in coming days including global economic bellwether caterpillar inc cat now may be a good time for the market to glean some insight into two of the highest profile issues of the day the economic effects of the u s china trade war and the partial u s government shutdown the trade dispute has been going on long enough that companies may talk about it in their earnings releases but investors may also want to pay attention to executive commentary during conference calls as they might provide what analysts call color on how the issue is affecting their business or how they think it might affect it in the future and those conference calls with analysts and investors may also provide more clarity on executives thinking on whether the government shutdown has impacted their businesses grounded flying is a great way to catch the flu being stuck inside an aluminum tube with dozens of other people for hours on end just

driving base business and new product growth we also continued our progress on expanding our portfolio with flavor growth a pure and low margin ingredient business we have a full year of our frank s and french s brand impacting our business not only in retail condiments and sauces and branded treats service but now in other categories as well with our frank s expansion beyond liquids growth in these brands accelerated over the course of the year and we re excited about their trajectory overall we re confident that the breadth and reach of our portfolio continues to position us to fully meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business heading into 2019 i m confident our momentum will continue this morning i will begin with fourth quarter results reflect on our 2018 achievements and then share with you some of our 2019 business plan after that i will turn it over to mike who will go to more depth on the quarter end results and the details of our 2019 guidance let s start with our fourth quarter results on slide 6 starting with our top line versus the year ago period we grew sales 1 for the total company including a 1 unfavorable impact from currency in constant currency we grew sales 2 with all regions in both segments contributing to the increase despite the significant trade inventory reductions in the u s sales growth was driven by brand marketing support expanded distribution new products and pricing in our consumer segment we grew our constant currency sales 2 in the fourth quarter in the americas we grew 1 driven by pricing we believe we substantially under shipped consumer consumption due to trade inventory reductions we estimate this resulted in the negative 3 impact to the americas growth rate for the quarter a portion of this reduction was due to a change in a large retail replenishment system which caused supply chain with disruption in november we continue to work collaboratively with this retailer restock their stores overall this customer as well as some other retailers the trade inventory reductions resulted in significant out of stock situations on high margin quality items therefore negatively impacting our fourth quarter adjusted operating income despite these out of stocks our iri data shows u s prices in seasonings scanner sales through multi outlets grew approximately 3 for both the category and mccormick branded supported by strong holiday advertising and merchandising execution and reflected improving share trends additionally we had strong growth in unmeasured channels including club e commerce and hispanic retail chains we also had strong consumption growth in other parts of our u s branded portfolio and combined with spices and seasonings we achieved our best fourth quarter consumption performance over the last five years our fourth quarter iri data shows total u s branded measured consumption excluding frank s and french s grew 4 and we estimate including unmeasured channels total consumption grew 5 we re seeing accelerated consumption trends driven by strong marketing and merchandising as well as new distribution mccormick branded dry recipe mixes stubb s and kitchen basics stocks and broths all had high single digit consumption growth with dry recipe mix and stubb s outpacing their respective categories and kitchen basic going in line in its category we re also seeing accelerating trends for frank s redhot sauce and french s since we acquired these brands during the fourth quarter our iri data shows frank s consumption grew 9 outpacing its category we continued our sequential improvement on french s mustard mustard volume consumption grew in the quarter and total dollar consumption growth was in line with the category this was the best performance of both frank s and french s mustard since the acquisition in europe middle east and africa the emea region constant currency consumer sales growth was driven by new products an increase in brand marketing support and continued momentum in france and in the asia pacific region our consumer segment momentum continued with double digit constant currency growth and increases across all categories and channels the fourth quarter constant currency sales growth was the best sales performance in both regions for the year turning now to the flavor solutions segment we grew sales 3 in constant currency in the fourth quarter with all three regions benefiting from higher volume in the americas we grew in all trend areas such as snack seasoning and savory flavors we continue to work with our customers particularly those experiencing several historic challenges to provide flavor solutions that deliver clean label and better for you attributes across all regions we grew with quicksilver s restaurants driven by both new customers and new products as well as existing business and as we continue to refine and optimize our portfolio the fourth quarter as well as the full year is impacted by the exit of lower margin business our fourth quarter adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share results had significant negative impact from the trade inventory reductions i mentioned a moment ago but the bottom line our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of 1 67 compared to 1 54 in the fourth quarter of 2017 this increase of 8 was driven primarily by favorable adjusted income tax rate and included an unfavorable impact from currency moving from our fourth quarter results i m pleased to share performance for the full fiscal year starting with our strong financial results as seen on slide 7 we drove 11 constant currency sales growth with the incremental sales from our acquired frank s and french s brands contributing 8 of this growth our underlying base growth increased 3 driven by new products brand marketing investments expanded distributions and pricing actions to offset material cost increases our consumer segment grew sales 10 in constant currency led by the frank s and french s acquisition impact and underlying base growth driven by the u s and china constant currency sales growth in our flavor solutions segment was 11 also led by incremental sales from frank s and french s all three regions delivered flavor solutions base growth including our exit of some lower margin business we grew constant currency adjusted operating income 19 driven by higher sales and 180 basis points adjusted gross margin expansion from cci led savings and our portfolio shift this increase combined with a lower adjusted effective tax rate was partially offset by higher interest expense and shares outstanding drove 17 increase in adjusted earnings per share to 4 97 for fiscal 2018 this increase in includes the impact of favorable currency exchange rates versus last year with higher sales cci and portfolio shift we increased our adjusted operating margin to 17 4 which was a 110 basis point expansion from last year we expanded adjusted operating margin in both of our segments and in record high we re also making investments to drive continued growth we reached a record 118 million of annual cost savings led by our cci program our fuel for growth and are well on our way toward exceeding our full year 400 million goal and we realized 344 million over the past three years 2018 was the seventh consecutive year of record cash flow from operation ending the year at 821 million we re making great progress with our working capital improvement and expect the programs we have put in place to continue the momentum into 2019 at year end our board of directors announced a 10 increase in the quarterly dividend marking our 33rd consecutive year of dividend increases we ve paid dividend every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat now i d like to comment on some of our 2018 achievements beyond our financial performance we ve successfully completed the integration of our frank s and french s

sales and earnings per share accretion expectations with strengthening distribution category management effective brand marketing investments and innovation we re successfully growing frank s and french s as mike will mention in more detail we ve also made great progress in paying down our acquisition debt and finish the year ahead of our debt to ebitda target a key driver of sales growth was our brand marketing which was up 18 over 2017 our leadership in digital was reworded again in 2018 with recognition as the top 3 brand by gartner lt research of their digital iq index this marked our fifth consecutive year in the top 5 ranking of over 100 food and beverage brands in the effectiveness of our websites digital social media and e commerce our investments and constant development resources to support accelerate as well as progress of items tailored to the e commerce channel are paying off we improve local e commerce sales 41 driven by strong omnichannel performance in the

replacement process of our existing erp system this will allow us to align our global operating model end to end processes simplify our work better manage risks and importantly to enable growth in 2018 we continue to invest further on our global footprint by increasing our capacity to support our growth in the asia pacific zone we opened a new regional manufacturing facility in thailand to expand both production capacity and capability to support growth segments growth plan in southeast asia we continued progressing on our global progress to upgrade the modern environment in the second

location the new headquarters incorporates open space technology enabled and accommodates the way employees want to work today and into the future it fosters a greater collaboration and engagement and helps us attract and retain the best talent and finally we re making measurable progress toward our 2025 sustainability goals and in addition we committed that by 2025 100 of our plastic packaging will be reusable recyclable or able to be repurposed we are being recognized for our efforts in sustainability just two days ago at the 2019 davos world economic forum mccormick was named by corporate knights and our 2019 global 100 most sustainable corporations index ranking us no 1 in the food products industry for the third consecutive year and no 13 overall and we were included on the very inaugural 100 most sustainable companies list in 2018 additionally we re diversity top 50 companies for the second consecutive year which is a testament to our emphasis on embracing and leveraging diversity and inclusion globally mike will deliver our 2019 guidance in a few moments but i d like to mention a few highlights related to our sales growth and plan and provide some summary comments on slide 10 as the foundation of our sales growth rate is the rising global consumer demand for great taste and healthy eating consumers have increased interest in creating flavor experiences of bold which authentic flavors while also demanding convenience additionally consumers are focused on fresh natural and recognizable ingredients with greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food flavor continues to be an advantaged global category and our products inspire flavor exploration and are the essential complement to fresh real food we deliver flavor across all markets and all channels and are aligned with the consumers demand for flavor convenience health and sustainably minded business practices our alignment with these long term trends our breadth and reach combined with our execution against effective strategies positions us well to meet increased consumer demand both through our products and through our customers product and drive sales growth in 2019 we ll continue to differentiate our brand build capabilities and make investments for growth that will continue to move us going forward across both segments we have confidence in our ability to drive sales through strong brand marketing program continued focus on customer intimacy our opportunities to expand distribution and of course new products new products are integral to our sales growth in 2018 8 of our sales were from product launches in the last three years in 2019 we expect new product sales growth to be even higher because in 2018 we refocused on integrating and growing frank s and french s in our consumer segment new product innovation is an important way to differentiate our brand and stay relevant with the consumers we have a robust global pipeline of new product launches in 2019 that resonates brand inspire flavor exploration and experimentation and meet the demand for convenience health and transparency and in our flavor solutions segment we will continue to capitalize on our culinary foundation and customer collaboration both of which differentiates us with customers this unique combination allows us to continue our new product momentum as our customers continue to review

plan and market dynamics in just a few weeks at cagny to summarize on slide 11 before turning it over to mike we achieved top tier financial results in 2018 delivered by both strong underlying business performance and the incremental impact of our acquisition of the frank s and french s brands and there s lighting strong momentum in sales growth in the consumer segment we finished the year

our effective strategies and momentum we are well positioned to achieve continued growth in 2019 thank you for your attention and it is now my pleasure to turn it over to mike for additional remarks on our 2018 financial results and the details on our 2019 guidance mike mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks lawrence and good morning everyone i will now comment on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as providing more detail on our 2019 outlook starting on slide 13 during the fourth quarter we grew sales 2 in constant currency both our consumer and flavor solutions segment delivered top line constant currency growth in each of our three regions the consumer segment grew sales 2 in constant currency this growth was driven by all three regions with strong growth in asia pacific and emea on slide 14 consumer segment sales in the americas rose 1 in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2017 this increase was driven by pricing actions volume growth was flat due to trade inventory reductions as mentioned by lawrence in emea constant currency consumer sales were up 3 from a year ago primarily driven due to broad based volume and product mix growth driven by brand marketing support as well as new products in the u k and continued momentum in the organic product line in france partially offsetting this growth was the pricing impact of trade promotional activities related to new products we grew consumer sales in the asia pacific region 10 in constant currency led by china growth with strength in new world flavor sauces ketchup chicken bouillon as well as herbs and spices turning to our flavor solutions segment and slide 17 we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 3 which was attributable to broad based growth across all regions in the americas flavor solutions constant currency sales increased 2 driven by increased sales to quick service restaurants and continued flavors momentum this was partially offset by the elimination of some low margin business as well as the global realignment of a major customer sales from the americas to emea in emea we grew flavor solution sales 5 in constant currency this increase was primarily driven by pricing as well as the previously mentioned global realignment of a major customer s sales from the americas to emea in the asia pacific region flavor solutions sales grew 3 in constant currency as higher sales to quick service restaurants were partially driven by the timing of promotional activity across both segments adjusted operating income which excludes the transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of our frank s and french s brands and special charges declined versus the fourth quarter of last year by 3 which included a 1 unfavorable impact to currency in the consumer segment adjusted operating income declined 3 to 228 million which in constant currency was a 2 decline the flavor solutions segment was also down 3 to 70 million in constant currency that was a 1 decrease the decline in both segments was partially due to unfavorable product mix higher freight costs and investments to drive future growth in the consumer segment the unfavorable mix was primarily driven as lawrence mentioned earlier by lower sales of high margin holiday items due to trade inventory reductions our investments to drive future growth included an increase in brand marketing of 7 or 7 million versus the fourth quarter of last year and we began the process to modernize our information technology systems including the replacement of our erp system additionally the flavor solutions segment had an unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates for the fiscal year the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency was 19 and we expanded adjusted operating income margin 110 basis points with both segments contributing to the growth the consumer segment grew constant currency adjusted operating income 13 while increasing our brand marketing and investments by 18 the flavor solutions segment grew constant currency adjusted operating income 34 versus 2017 our flavor solution strategy to migrate our portfolio to more value added categories is evident in these results the shift in our portfolio combined with cci has increased flavor solutions adjusted operating margin to 14 2 an expansion of 230 basis points in 2018 as seen on slide 22 in the fourth quarter adjusted gross profit margin which excludes transaction and integration expenses declined 30 basis points versus the year ago period driven by unfavorable product mix partially offset by cci cost savings we ended the full year with a 180 basis points increase driven by the accretion impact from the addition of frank s and french s portfolio as well as cci cost savings and favorable product mix across the core business our selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased by 40 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 leverage from sales growth and cci led cost savings was more than offset by increases in both brand marketing and freight expense as well as spending related to our information systems modernization below the operating income line other income increased 7 million the increase in other income was driven due to a gain on the sale of a building we vacated as part of the office consolidation into our new global headquarters which lawrence mentioned earlier the expenses we incurred related to the office consolidation reduced operating income for the year by approximately 4 million turning to income taxes on slide 23 our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 19 which reflects the favorable impact from a lower u s corporate tax rate as compared to 26 2 in the year ago period our fourth quarter adjusted rate was lower than anticipated due to the favorable impact of discrete items principally a higher level of stock option exercises for the full year our adjusted tax rate was 19 6 compared to 26 1 in fiscal 2017 income from unconsolidated operations for both the fourth quarter of 2018 and the full year was comparable to the respective year ago periods for 2019 we expect a low single digit increase in our income from unconsolidated operations at the bottom line as shown on slide 25 fourth quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was 1 67 up 8 from 1 54 for the year ago period mainly due to a favorable investment income tax rate this increase included an unfavorable impact from currency on slide 26 we summarized highlights for cash flow and the year end balance sheet our cash flow provided from operations ended the year at a record high of 821 million compared to 815 million in 2017 for the fiscal year our cash conversion cycle was significantly better than year ago period down 21 days as we executed against programs to achieve working capital reductions such as expanding payment programs with our suppliers and inventory management programs we returned a portion of this cash flow to our shareholders through dividends additionally we reduced our acquisition debt in the fourth quarter by 209 million which brings our total acquisition debt reduction in the fiscal year to 545 million and we have now paid down over 50 of the term notes related to the acquisition we finished the year with a debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of four times which is ahead of our target this strong progress positions us well to achieve our three times target by the end of 2020 our capital expenditures were 169 million in 2018 and included the completion of our regional manufacturing facility in thailand and spending related to our new global headquarters in 2019 we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2018 to support our investments to drive growth particularly the transition of our erp platform we expect 2019 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash making investments to drive growth returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt let s now move to our current financial outlook for 2019 on slide 27 we are well positioned for another year of solid performance with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio effective growth strategies and focus on profit realization as lawrence mentioned we continue to expect solid constant currency growth for fiscal year 2019 we estimate based on prevailing rates a 2 percentage points unfavorable impact from currency rates on net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share we expect the impact of unfavorable currency will be greater in the first half of the year than in the second half at the top line we expect to grow sales 1 to 3 which in constant currency is a 3 to 5 projected growth rate this increase will be entirely organic growth with no incremental impact from acquisitions the growth will be driven primarily by higher volume and product mix as well as the impact of pricing to offset an anticipated low single digit cost increase our 2019 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2018 in part driven by our cci led cost savings we expect to increase adjusted operating income 7 to 9 from 942 million in 2018 which in constant currency is a 9 to 11 projected growth rate and reflects our continued focus on profit realization our cost savings target is approximately 110 million and we expect brand marketing to be comparable to 2018 our 2019 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to approximate 22 base upon our estimated mix of earnings by country in addition to our state tax rates this projection is well within our underlying effective tax rate of 24 due to the favorable impact of discrete tax items which occurred during the first quarter of 2019 related to our entity structure our full year 22 outlook versus our 2018 adjusted effective tax rate of 19 6 is approximately 300 basis point headwind to our 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth our guidance range for our adjusted earnings per share in 2019 is 5 17 to 5 27 this compares to 4 97 of adjusted earnings per share in 2018 and represents a 4 to 6 increase or 6 to 8 in constant currency this increase includes expected significant tax headwind i just mentioned in summary we are projecting solid growth in our 2019 constant currency outlook for sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share following record double digit performance across each objective in 2018 i d like to let you know that we ll be adopting two new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2019 on a retrospective basis with the adoption of these two standards we expect no impact to net income and only a geography shift between income statement line items we also do not anticipate the adoptions will materially impact growth rates or other expectations we provided in our 2019 financial outlook this morning we have provided summary points regarding this topic in the appendix of our presentation and further discussion of these changes will be included in the 10 k we filed this evening on a final note related to our guidance turning to slide 28 i want to discuss our performance versus our constant currency long term financial objectives we evaluate our performance against our long term objectives every several years partially because of the variability which can occur year to year related to acquisition activity as a reminder we have an objective to grow sales 4 to 6 with base business new products and acquisitions each contributing one third so excluding one third from acquisitions our growth expectations will be to grow sales approximately 3 to 4 additionally our objective is to grow adjusted operating income 7 to 9 then by using leverage gained through our capital deployment activities including our share repurchase program our objective is to grow adjusted earnings per share 9 to 11 as we have previously stated after making our frank s and french s acquisition we have curtailed acquisition activity and our share buyback program as we delever and therefore use our cash flow to pay down debt as mentioned earlier we are making significant progress to leveraging and in line with our original plan our acquisition activity and buyback program will remain curtailed in 2019 from a sales perspective our 2019 guidance of 3 to 5 is in line with our long term growth objectives without incremental acquisition growth our adjusted operating income guidance is 9 to 11 which is actually above our long term growth objectives despite these strong operating expectations the adjusted effective income tax rate increase i mentioned before is a significant headwind to our 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth looking at our performance over a 4 year period using the 2019 guidance i ve just reviewed our compounded annual growth rate for 2015 from before the frank s and french s acquisition to 2019 the first full year these brands are in our base are projected to exceed our long term goals for each objective even including the negative effect of currency experienced during this period as lawrence mentioned our foundation is strong our strategy is effective and we are generating results in line with our objectives i d like to now turn it back to lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mike now that mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail i d like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 29 we delivered another year of record results in 2018 despite trade inventory reductions we achieved strong organic sales growth for the year we significantly grew adjusted operating income while also increasing brand marketing and achieved frank s and french s results in line with our plan we ended 2018 with the strongest consumption trend in years in our consumer business and solid growth in every region for flavor solutions our 2019 constant currency outlook reflects strong operating performance driven by our solid foundation and continued momentum our earnings per share growth was robust despite a significant tax headwind and we re confident that 2019 will be another successful year and we will create additional volume and importantly we re continuing to deliver differentiated results while significantly investing for growth to build mccormick of the future and we ll share more about these investments at cagny in a few weeks and now let s turn to your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays please proceed with your question andrew lazar barclays capital analyst good morning everybody lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer good morning andrew mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning andrew lazar barclays capital analyst hi i guess first i m looking at was the replenishment issue that you talked about a key customer or customers were those really just in mccormick s category or categories or is this something you think we ll hear more about from peers as we go forward and then a 3 headwind to americas consumer that you mentioned is obviously a less of headwind to the overall business it still seems like maybe organic sales growth even excluding that might have come in a little short of where like consensus was for organic sales growth in the quarter i wonder if there are any additional areas that came in differently around the top line than may be you anticipated that are worth mentioning thank you lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer thanks andrew i m going to start with the first part of that question the replenishment issue there s been a general trend for all of our customers to be working their inventories lower as you know and others have reported on it the particular issues that impacted us in the fourth quarter were really had two parts to it the first part was the move by a key customer as well and handful of key customers to reduce their inventory levels overall it is on timing for them to do this for our category but it may have made sense for them across their broader store and for us of course the fourth quarter is the real peak and i would expect you to hear from others saying similar things regarding that portion of the trade reduction and i believe actually some of our peers have already commented on this and the costs those who have come ahead of us there was a part of that was unique to us and that there was a large customer who s name i m not going to use that had change in their internal store replenishment system this was actually switched on in error by them and so that had a big impact in that there warehouses and stores did not recognize each other s order numbers and as a result stores were not replenished that s going to be a change that is unique to us this customer is making that transition broadly but it is for our category that was scheduled for much later next year we would have run all the beta tests and so on and would have had a different experience if had done in a different way and again it was an error internal hit that the customer and we are still working through this in a sense that for every order we have to do literally a workaround to get the stores restocked so that part is unique to us we ve highlighted this as a 3 headwind overall to our business in the in our americas business in the quarter we re not rounding up again to get to that number we have a pretty good handle on it on our ability to quantify it was holiday items it was specific customers and we really know what it was mike do you want to go further on that mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer andrew lazar barclays capital analyst great i appreciate the details see you in a couple of weeks lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer great see you andrew lazar barclays capital analyst yes operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with crédit suisse please proceed with your question robert moskow credit suisse analyst hi i guess i have two questions the 9 to 11 constant currency ebit growth target for 2019 now sounds rather aggressive given that what s demonstrated here in fourth quarter is that you ended a vulnerable to a lot of the trends that are happening across the food space you had inventory reductions you mentioned some freight costs and i just want to know how do you get from the sales guide to the ebit guide i know you have your normal cost savings programs but you also mentioned mix was a headwind in fourth quarter why wouldn t it be a headwind in 2019 and then i have a follow up mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer rob this is mike i ll start this one let s talk about fourth quarter first because you talked about when you talked about product mix in the fourth quarter a significant portion of that is really related to the trade inventory issues these are our highest margin holiday items so that was a significant hit to our fourth quarter operating profit we also did take the opportunity in the fourth quarter we just like we did in the third quarter we had some benefits from stock options which is below the operating profit line some of these savings we invested those in brand marketing up 7 we took opportunities started investing in our it refreshment programs so if you look at 2019 though we ve gone from the 3 to 5 down to 9 to 11 we talked about keeping brand marketing flat we took the opportunity as i said in the fourth quarter really invest and drive back consumption in the fourth quarter get it to a level we feel comfortable expanding in 2019 while we are getting to get more effective and we re going to have more working media in 2019 that s going to give us about 100 basis points right there keeping that flat we re also getting more synergies from the frank s and french s the second year that sort of have a wrap from last year and additional frank s and french s synergies our cci focus really is we look at cost of goods sold and sg a we re really leaning in there also and some of the things happen in the fourth quarter we talk about the move into the new building we re not going to have those costs next year so it s a variety of things that aren t going to happen in 2019 that we feel very strongly by giving this guidance robert moskow credit suisse analyst ok and then my follow up is i did an inventory report on the broader group back in october and mccormick popped up as a company that had been shipping at a growth rate that was well above the nielsen measured consumption for quite a while you had called out that there are other channels that are not measured by nielsen so that was a big portion of the disconnect and you also pointed out that you always do a conservative job of assuming inventory reductions during the course of the year so i guess given what happened here in fourth how much comfort you have that you have could visibility of how much inventory is really at the trade and that you head into 2019 and that this will truly prove episodic or have you assumed another inventory burn again in 2019 thanks lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer sure rob i m going to take this to start and mike join me if i miss anything on this but this was an extraordinary situation it s not the normal pattern that we ve experienced normally we see a drawdown in q1 our q1 that coincides with a lot of our customers end of the year and then relative flatness for the rest of the year this impact that happened in fourth quarter was really extraordinary and does not reflect a build of inventory previously this is it s quite discrete with a small set of customers we had one very large customer that had the biggest impact it was devastating to their stores they are it s inventory this was not an intentional move on their part and as a result their stores had tremendous out of stocks through the holiday season and so it s hard to imagine that retailer taking inventory down further than they did because they literally ran themselves out of product in terms of our looking forward we always include in our plans and in our sales guidance level of inventory of drawdown not always but we had for the last several years and we ve included in the guidance for sales for next year further reduction in inventory across the trade not necessarily those customers specifically but this timing that happened both the size and the timing of it and the products involved we re surprised this happened to us at the most sensitive time of year for us as we re coming to not only the peak consumption period but also the cutoff on our fiscal year we don t get a do over on thanksgiving and so this had it really had a big impact for us robert moskow credit suisse analyst ok thanks for the answers operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein please proceed with your question alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst good morning everyone lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer good morning alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst hi could i ask about the flavor solutions business it s up until this quarter it was doing really incredibly well on profit growth top line growth clearly the profits took a half bit of a pause on that trajectory this time around was there something that happened did the contracts got lost or is this just lapping tougher comps from a year ago and what s the prognosis from here does it step down to some of a more normal level can the margins continue to expand thank you and i ll pass it on lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i ll just say a word about this then i m going to give it to mike but the flavor solutions business is always pretty lumpy and so there s more volatility in the quarter to quarter results on that i think if you look at the whole year we re very pleased that we don t see any issue actually are quite pleased with how we come out of the year on flavor solutions and our outlook is as optimistic as it has been mike mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i d say within the flavor solutions business a couple of things happened in the quarter and i mentioned this on the call we have a bit a transactional fx unfavorability which impacted not the whole company too from an operating profit perspective but because of our footprint with some of the currencies but also unfavorable product mix and some as lawrence said flavor solutions can be lumpy and some of our regions the growth was more on core products versus ltos ltos generally have higher margins so you have these sometimes when our customers advertising something we ve done for a long time as the base product that has a lower margin that might have a little bit of a product mix negative so we saw some of that this quarter too alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst thank you very much i ll pass it on operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david driscoll with citi please proceed with your question lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer hey david are you there operator mr driscoll your line is live perhaps you re muted on your end lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer just we go on to the next question and give david the opportunity to come in operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with j p morgan please proceed with your question ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst hi thanks so much a couple for me in each of the last i think seven years by our math your initial guidance for your tax rate has proven a bit conservative meaning you ve guided to a higher tax rate than i guess what you ultimately reported just wondering is there any reason we should think 2019 will be different given history it seems reasonable to expect your tax rate to come in below the 22 you guided to today but just trying to get a feel for what you re thinking there this coming year mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer david this is mike i ll take this one we generally we don t sorry can t i was on ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst close enough i ll take it mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer close enough we know the difference yes we have been favorable on our tax but a big part of that is we don t forecast discrete tax items but if you think about this year i m talking about this year first before i talk about next year before the tax act we might have an underlying rate of 28 to 29 and guidance at the beginning of this year after the tax act was about 24 and we came in slightly below 20 so about a 400 basis points favorability 300 basis points of that was a stock option exercises which one we don t forecast for and we don t know when it s going to happen so there s another 100 basis points of other stuff tax settlements things like that but we really don t forecast discrete tax items for 19 the underlying tax rate is about 24 similar to this year as we kind of go through also a process recently going through the regs that were just released by the department of treasury we did some tax planning and that s why we said look this is significant tax item hitting early in the year we re calling 22 there could be some stock option exercises there could be some other discrete tax items but we want to give you at least a benchmark of what we see is there and hopefully it is favorable but we there s some judgment there ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst that s helpful no very helpful mike my follow up is you talked about low single digit raw material cost inflation for the year forgive me i don t think that includes transportation costs and correct me if i m wrong but you re of the first food companies to really provide detailed guidance for the upcoming calendar year i m just curious on that freight for the transportation logistics whatever you want to sort of defined i don t think raw material necessarily if you re seeing any sort of easing and pressure from that area mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer no we throw it all in there ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst we do ok good mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we throw it all in ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst and if i could ask a quick clarification then just within that just to get a better sense of transportation are you seeing an easing in that particular part of it mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer well we ve seen we know 18 was a significant increase from 17 and we ve had a lot of activities in our north america primarily through cci program to mitigate the cost as we see them going to 2019 but we still do see inflation there lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer we were not seeing an easing there ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst great thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs please proceed with your question adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer good morning adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst maybe a question just on the trajectory first on organic both on the fourth quarter and then into 19 on the frank s and french s business because they are now in the organic base just trying to make this aggregate that the inventory trade reduction in the quarter which clearly impacted the consumers americas business but would have thought that the frank s and french s now coming into organic would have been would have helped your business reported into more and just help me think about how those business are performing on underlying business it sounded like the trade reductions were more legacy of mccormick guidance lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i m glad you asked that question because in answering a couple of the earlier questions about the inventory reductions we didn t talk about the other side of the of what was happening which is our consumption has been incredibly strong we came out of the year with the strongest consumption performance for a fourth quarter in the last five years it s one of the strongest quarters for a period and that s part of what gives us optimism around 2019 the frank s and french s items were no exception to that so our consumer offtake is as measured through scanner data on frank s was up 9 in the quarter our offtake on mustard was almost flat and if you recall our goal that we announced when we bought this business was that we were going to drive growth on frank s and we were going to stabilize the french s mustard and i think we re making great progress on that and so i think that that consumption trajectory on both the acquired brands and also on our core business gives us confidence in the sales numbers for 2019 mike do you want to make some comments on the inventory mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer well yes let me talk to about in the fourth quarter some of that advertising investment was driving frank s we talked about the first time we advertised in frank s in seven years the new advertising which just dropped this week that s kind of supports the first quarter a lot of new products coming in the first quarter frank s and french s was impacted as lawrence said by the trade inventory reductions though but we expect the strong first quarter from both brands because of the consumption we re seeing adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok and then just on the guidance between the sales and margin expansion goals that you ve laid out is there any notable delineation between the consumer and the flavor solutions business and i e is the base expectation that there s faster growth in flavors or consumer more margin expansion of one versus the other mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer no we generally feel pretty comfortable between the two adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok that s it s very helpful i ll pass it on operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david driscoll with citi please proceed with your question mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer hey david are you there this time david driscoll citi research analyst yes i m here this time i apologize the telecom blitz right there it was like one second before you call my name so ok two questions for you you talked about the erp system we re sensitive to changes in erps can you just walk us through kind of the risk points on when we need to be focused on the big modules and kind of when they come into play and i think you called it out in the fourth quarter as part of it i don t know what s already taken place versus what has to take place on the system change lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer well david as you know this is kind of a two to three year process we re kind of in the early days year anything i wouldn t your guidance considers any expense that are going to occur on erp a lot of it is capital and we talked about in the call we re going to have an increase in capital versus this year our capital this year we have a target of 200 million due to a lot of timing issues it came down to almost about 170 million we don t see it we see some incremental capital investment next year but i wouldn t describe a large impact i mean our guidance is our guidance and it incorporates all those impacts david driscoll citi research analyst let me clarify lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer as we get more detail david i ll commit to give you more detail but as i ve said before we re pretty early days on this but we have made some investments in the fourth quarter to help jump start that david driscoll citi research analyst yes it wasn t really a question on capital spending it was a question on erp systems and the disruptions that they sometimes cause when the execution doesn t go well there s always certain modules within these erp systems that are far more sensitive than other modules and i was just looking for a piece of information related to when the significant modules go into play lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer well if i could just pick this up so as you know these it sounds like you understand exactly what s involved in these projects so there was a long period of scoping of code writing building before you get your first go live on anything so we re in that upfront stage of it right now our first go live is not until 2020 but this year is the year when we do all of the work getting ready and i ll just add to it that we re due for it we did our first sap go live in 2002 we still have done some go lives on sap this year has been a long and drawn out process but once the new system is now become the legacy system sap as you know goes out of maintenance it becomes obsolete in 2023 we want to be ahead of the curve like getting migrating to the next generation of erp not be doing it at the last minute so everybody s going to have to make this anybody is on sap is going to have this transition over the next several years we re really getting started some on it didn t incur some expense but we got in the fourth quarter and will throughout 2019 but we really want we won t get until our first actual go live until 2020 i ll add that it is our plan to move quickly it s taken almost 20 years to roll out sap across our whole company we are not going to take 20 years to do the refresh which will still be on sap product david driscoll citi research analyst kind of like the 20 year comment my second question relates to your flavor solutions it s a follow up to one of the earlier questions but i want to think a little bit longer term flavor solutions margins went from about 7 5 five seven years ago to over 14 a massive increase when i look at this the pie breakdown your ingredients proportion of the flavor solutions is kind of small now so i think that was the low margin stuff that you slowly but surely been exiting and then adding other high margin pieces like flavors lawrence what i don t get a sense on but i get this question a lot from investors is how much more is there to go can you double the size of the flavors portion of flavor solutions and is that high enough margin to keep pushing the segment margin significantly higher over some course of time this isn t a the next year question lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i understand this is a great long term question and i appreciate the opportunity to talk about something besides the inventory reduction in the fourth quarter this is the in fact our strategy that you just described for our flavor solutions segment we are downgrading our portfolio to more of the flavor and seasoning we certainly see value on some of the customer foodservice products and condiments that we do but away from that or come out of the ingredient and spectrum and we see a long runway of opportunity of enhancing our margin from this migration of our portfolio to now value added products you can see from the public company competitors who are more pure play on flavor their margins are significantly higher to us and as we aspire to move more in that direction and i m not sure how high up is but it s a long way from where we are now and there are parts in the other slices of pie too for example in condiments there s low margin condiments and higher margin so obviously we would optimize this as we go david driscoll citi research analyst thank you guys lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer thanks david operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris growe with stifel please proceed with your question chris growe stifel financial corp analyst hi good morning lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer good morning chris chris growe stifel financial corp analyst i had just two questions if i could so the price is a little less than i expected in the fourth quarter i know you talked about some new products and spending around those new products i m sure it was more of effect on weight on pricing as more promotional driven so my question is did pricing line up with cost inflation in the fourth quarter do you expect that 19 or maybe more new product cost is going to weigh on that pricing line overall mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer hey chris this is mike i ll take that if you look at the split by region i don t focus on consumer i mean pricing for consumer is only up 0 2 but in the americas it was up 0 6 and that was covering the cost of inflation some of the pricing we took early in the year recipe mixes asia pacific 1 5 emea where we had really strong overall sales performance from kind of the relaunch of our first choice spice line we had obviously some trade promotional slotting key things like that which is negative on price so emea was negative 2 2 so that s what drove the whole consumer down and that was a significant restage for that region so we don t see we see in 19 our pricing actions the ramp from last year and anything we need to do to cover our low single digit cost inflation we see those covering off lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer right other than the cost of new distribution we don t see any extraordinary pressure on promotion expense if anything to revenue management that s been a net positive for us chris growe stifel financial corp analyst and with pricing also cost inflation in your view that from a higher level in 2019 is that your expectation lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i m sorry i m not sure i got the question could you repeat that chris growe stifel financial corp analyst would do you expect your price realization to offset cost inflation in 2019 from a high level not quarter to quarter that kind of thing but do you expect that we will be able to price to your cost inflation in 2019 lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer yes we also have cci programs things like that to there s a broad basket of tools chris growe stifel financial corp analyst ok yes and just one final one in the fourth quarter i think you had a gain on the sale of a building also had some costs related to moving into the new facility were there cost out of the quarter in this fourth quarter had that benefit of that gain and i m just curious how this applies to the comps for 2019 mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer chris they were in the second half we figured we moved most of the people in the july august september timeframe and had a grand opening actually in october so a lot of those expenses were second half chris growe stifel financial corp analyst and the gain did that more than offset the cost or lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer yes it does yes we said that in the call between net to 2 million mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer 4 million spent hurt operating expense there is a geography difference there that opposite the gain was below the operating profit line but all the expenses were above chris growe stifel financial corp analyst ok that s helpful thank you so much for your time operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rob dickerson with deutsche bank please proceed with your question rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst great thank you good morning hello i have two hopefully it s really quick couple of questions first question is just any color i know you don t always obviously don t guide quarter to quarter but just any color around kind of cadence for 19 well i guess with respect to organic sales trajectory sequentially and then also just a margin it looks like your guidance is implies call it about 100 basis points operating profit margin i know you said earlier in response to a question it s not hard to get there just given keeping the media spend flat i m curious like obviously just every year if you report q4 you re already half of q1 and given this holiday issue and some of the replenishment piece was for your quarter ending in november and then you also have december baked in q1 do some of that some of the replenishment issue flow through into q1 and then does more of the margin expansion more back half loaded just given timing of 18 spend and then also the inventory issue you had in q4 sorry if that s not worthy did you get my point mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer that s right i think we got the concept rob this is mike i ll start this with we do not provide guidance by quarter however talk about 2 fx unfavorable during the year that s really first half loaded so there s really going to be some negative fx there first quarter is our smallest issue as lawrence said smallest quarter right no our first quarter is our smallest quarter of the year we are still working through some of the replenishment issue but we also talked about how the first quarter discrete tax items so that s going to help our tax line we ll make some investments as we talked about before it s really like an it and other things early in the year being the smallest quarter of the year there may be more impact on that but again for the full year 100 basis points increase in operating profit we re comfortable with that lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and i ll say there may be as we look ahead to some events that might happen in this volatile environment such as brexit we may depending on how they are unfolding we may have to incur some expense to prepare us for managing our risks through our brexit for example rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst yes i just mean potential outside total manufacturing sourcing or lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer yes inventory build things like that yes rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst yes ok fair and then second question just more so on rb foods i realized some additional growth coming from non track channels and non track channels it looks like year over year growth definitely so strong or better even with frank s so that s net positive it looked like it peaked more in that august september period year over year and then french s as you said is stabilizing but still a drag so i m just curious with respect to 19 didn t hear a lot or anything on potential innovation around the growing season how do you actually increase momentum behind the french s and then secondly just international opportunity which you didn t discuss upfront on the acquisition i think the last call but didn t hear much of that today i hope that s more cagny related things lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer right yes rob exactly i think we ll cover this more thoroughly at cagny we ll look look at our and we ll talk more about our 2019 plans and beyond at cagny but we re really pleased with the performance of rb foods i don t want to let this go but i m saying that and you mentioned our peak around august actually our consumption on these products increased sequentially quarter by quarter throughout the entire year the fourth quarter consumption was the strongest that we ve had but there was impact from that inventory issue on the purchase frank s and french s brand i actually don t have it at my fingertips but the shipment was the consumer offtake was the strongest that we ve had and we think we ve got good momentum going forward in 2019 on those brands which we re now not really we re not breaking them out because we re treating them just like many of our other major brands in terms of our reporting but when i say major brands these are the second and third largest brands in our portfolio after mccormick so they certainly get a lot of attention mike do you want to rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst fair enough thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jonathan feeney with consumer edge research please proceed with your question jonathan feeney consumer edge research analyst a couple of questions first i guess following up from your conversation with rob and your comment that rob moskow i should say and your comment on consumption it sounds like because i m looking at the measured data it sounds like non measured this was a record q4 for you non measured continues to grow terrifically for you if you could just comment on non measured especially online how that s going fiscal third versus fiscal fourth and then second question is what are the big sources of gross margin mix and within that what impact on the gross margin specifically or how big of an impact could this one set of seasonal high margin items have had on your gross margin broadly it seems like there s other gross margin mix items that are more structural and maybe comment on how those play into your hope your plans for gross margin expansion in 2019 thank you very much lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i m going to start and i m going to pass it over to mike but the strong consumption includes unmeasured channels but we re specifically pointing to the measured channels so that everybody could see it so if you look at the iri data in aggregate over the last going back five years it seems that through measured channels this was the strongest fourth quarter in the last five years and then on top of that we had good performance in our unmeasured channels as well the contributed i think i tried to cover that in my prepared remarks but i want to really underscore that you can see it in the measured data when you look at for us iri the impact jonathan feeney consumer edge research analyst but would that also be true would that also be true that that comment would be also be true on your nonmeasured channels that acceleration there lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i m not sure that the growth rate was higher but it was definitely a contributor to the positive growth and at a higher rate than the scanned sales some just go put that out there now the margin impact is from the again i can t underestimate mike talked about this a little bit this happened at the worst possible time for us and the items that we have the holiday time are very seasonal in nature they are our highest margin part of the portfolio if you thought john you followed us for a long time you see the difference in our margin structure quarter by quarter that s driven by that sort of holiday items when we don t have that that s a big impact on the bottom line mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s basically why i mean there s are a high margin items seems like french s some of the trade inventories and then you say inventory items we talked about too things like the recipe mixes core herbs and spices those are if you look at it quarter by quarter as lawrence said fourth quarter is always our highest quarter and atually late in the quarter is usually higher jonathan feeney consumer edge research analyst mike could i say that was a primary contributor then to gross margin contraction that one issue mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes definitely definitely operator thank you ladies and gentleman our final question for this morning will come from the line of akshay jagdale with jefferies akshay jagdale jefferies analyst thanks for squeezing me in so one follow up goes back to i think andrew s first question i know you don t give quarterly guidance but for the fourth quarter we have the benefit of quarter 3 guidance given how you guide right so the sales growth in the quarter was about 300 basis points below what you had expected so the inventory stuff that s about 100 150 bps it does imply that something else was weaker but it from everything you ve said it sounds to me like the main issue really is still the inventory issue right so can you just help me bridge that because it does look like from a purely quantitative standpoint there are some other factors that have might have been weaker than you would had expected thank you and i ll pass it on mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer akshay this is mike and for the year we gave guidance of 12 to 14 and we came in basically at the bottom of that 11 9 the implied guidance for the fourth quarter was 0 9 to 7 4 pretty big range because we don t take the year guidance down to 1 spread we came in at 0 6 reported so we were right at the bottom the trade inventory programs were 1 5 impact or so when you think about 20 million to 25 million of net sales that would have put us up in that 0 9 to 7 4 so i think we are comfortable with the guidance we were giving for the fourth quarter implicit in our full year guidance so a little bit at the low end of the range but we would have been well within the q4 implied guidance akshay jagdale jefferies analyst got it so overall the main standout is this inventory issue and what gives you confidence is clearly the consumption trends are very very strong and accelerating in many areas that s the main takeaway from your perspective on sales right lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer absolutely that s exactly right because in the long run sales are being followed by consumer and that s why we spent so much time in our remarks today on the consumption trends and while the trade inventory reduction happened at the worst time for us we re very disappointed and the impact that it had at the end of the year our consumer consumption is strong and our international business is strong and our flavor solutions business continues to power on we believe there s a short term challenge and a long term upward trend fueled by alignment of really long term consumer trend a sound strategy and i ll add a talented and engaged workforce and that gives us a lot of confidence in our 2019 operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session today i ll turn the floor back to mr kurzius for any final comments lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer thanks everyone for your questions and for participating on today s call mccormick is a global leader in flavor we re differentiated with a broad and portfolio which continues to drive growth responding to changes in the industry with new ideas innovation and purpose with a keen focus on growth

sterling surges broadly today on rumors that northern ireland s dup has privately agreed to conditional support to prime minister theresa may s brexit deal the pound is also the strongest one for the week while there are still a lot of uncertainties surrounding brexit outcome at least the threat of no deal brexit is eased however we d doubt if the rumored condition of time limit on irish backstop would get agreement from brexit hardliners and the eu canadian dollar second strongest for today follows oil price higher as us threatens to sanction venezuela staying in the currency markets yen is trading as the weakest one for today following strong risk appetite in asia tech stocks led the way higher while investors shrug off conflicting comments from the us regarding trade negotiation with china on the one hand commerce secretary wilbur ross said the two countries are miles and miles away on a trade deal but white house economic adviser larry kudlow said trump is optimistic dollar follows as the second weakest euro is mixed after some knee jerk actions follow ecb meeting yesterday technically gbp usd is now close to structural resistance at 1 3174 which is close to 1 3149 fibonacci level we d expect strong resistance in this zone to complete the rebound from 1 2391 but we ll see how it goes eur gbp breached 0 8620 key support today for now we d also look for strong support at current level to bring rebound however sustained break of 0 8620 will resume larger fall from 0 9305 2017 high in other markets nikkei closed up 0 97 hong kong hsi is up 1 48 china shanghai

dropped 0 043 to 2 712 2 7 is now a level to defend sterling jumps on rumor that dup offer conditional support to may s brexit deal sterling surges broadly again on hope that uk prime minister theresa may inches closer to getting enough support for an amended brexit deal the sun reported that north ireland s dup is having delicate deliberations with may and it s privately agreed that dup will support the brexit plan if there is a time limit of the irish backstop that came on dup s concern that pro remain tories and labour are pushing for a significantly softer brexit however it should first be noted that such a time limit is likely not enough to win over brexit hardliners erg chair jacob rees mogg is clear in his demand for complete removal more importantly eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier has blunted rejected the idea of time limit already he said yesterday that we have to maintain the credibility of this reassurance it cannot be time limited it s not just about ireland trump requesting down payment for border wall and preparing declaration of national emergency both trump s and democrat s proposal to end the historical shutdown in the us were blocked in the senate yesterday white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders said afterwards that the three week cr would only work if there is a large down payment on the wall that is trump is offering to reopen the government temporarily for three weeks with certain down payment for the usd 5 7b border wall senate minority leader chuck schumer said after meting senate majority leader mitch mcconnell that senate democrats have made clear to leader mcconnell and republicans that they will not support funding for the wall prorated or otherwise house speaker nancy pelosi also criticized that trump demand for down payment is not a reasonable agreement the house democrats plan to offer a proposal today on border security without the wall separately cnn reported that trump is preparing a draft to declare national emergency and more than usd 7b in potential funds is already identified for the border wall according to cnn in the draft it s said the massive amount of aliens who unlawfully enter the united states each day is a direct threat to the safety and security of our nation and constitutes a national emergency and now therefore i donald j trump by the authority vested in me by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america including the national emergencies act 50 u s c 1601 et seq hereby declare that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the united states ecb stood pat noted risks to outlook moved to the downside the ecb meeting evolved as we had expected more dovish downgraded assessment on economy leaving unchanged the forward guidance on interest rates the central bank has acknowledged that the uncertainties in the global economy have intensified and can persist for quite an extended time no change was made in the monetary policy leaving the main refi rate the marginal lending rate and the deposit rate unchanged at 0 00 0 25 and 0 40 respectively cb noted that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside this is the first time since april 2017 that the central bank admitted that risks are to the downside over the past 21 months ecb had been describing risks as broadly balanced while suggesting the balance is moving to the downside the uncertainties ecb has identified are geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility these have been unchanged from previous meetings more in ecb turns dovish amid heightened global uncertainties suggested readings on ecb on the data front japan tokyo cpi core accelerated

daily outlook daily pivots s1 1 3018 p 1 3057 r1 1 3101 more gbp usd s rally continues today and reaches as high as 1 3139 so far intraday bias stays on the upside for 1 3149 74 resistance zone 38 2 retracement of 1 4376 to 1 2391 at 1 3149 at this point we d still expect strong resistance from there to limit upside at least on first attempt on the downside below 1 3012 minor support will turn intraday bias back to the downside for 1 2814 resistance turned support first however firm break of 1 3149 74 will pave the way to 61 8 retracement at 1 3618 in the bigger picture whole medium term rebound from 1 1946 2016 low should have completed at 1 4376 already after rejection from 55 month ema the structure and momentum of the fall from 1 4376 argues that it s resuming long term down trend from 2 1161 2007 high and this will remain the preferred case as long as 1 3174 structural resistance holds gbp usd should target a test on 1 1946 first decisive break there will confirm our bearish view however sustained break of 1 3174 will invalidate this case and turn outlook bullish economic indicators update

delhi meghnad desai academy of economics mdae india s top institute for post graduate economics recently had the privilege of hosting a session with imf senior resident representative for india nepal bhutan andreas bauer titled the global economic outlook and implications for india s economy the lecture from the imf representative gave an insight into the current scenario of the global economy the various factors that are influencing the indian economy and how india is positioned amongst emerging markets around the world during the lecture bauer spoke about the global outlook where growth appears to have reached a plateau and risks are tilted to the downside issues discussed included the impact of increasing oil prices uk s economy slowing down due to brexit usa s big tax cuts and budget expansion and the structural factors that are holding down the potential growth rate of european economies in particular ageing populations bauer presented a generally positive outlook for the indian economy and the asian region although with some risks emerging market economies around the world are growing much faster than advanced economies india the fastest growing major economy in the world and china together are expected to contribute about 50 to global growth in 2018 asia altogether will account for about 2 3rd of global growth bauer said with regards to the ongoing global trade tensions bauer presented analysis from the recent imf regional economic outlook for asia and the pacific which suggests that an escalation of protectionist measures would affect growth in china and the usa more than other countries he noted that india would be less affected by a trade war comparatively india s economy is less exposed to an escalation of protectionist measures than other countries indeed higher tariffs between china and the usa could lead to some increase in india s exports and have a mildly positive impact on growth but if the trade war escalates and affects investment and asset prices then it would be also harmful for india with regards to india s domestic growth drivers bauer mentioned that demonetization and gst had caused a negative shock but these effects have now largely dissipated and economic activity is accelerating a key challenge for the indian economy in the period ahead is to manage the more challenging external environment india being an oil importer is exposed to fluctuating oil prices which affect growth inflation and the current account deficit said bauer he noted that the rupee is also weakening due to a global phenomenon as portfolio investors are reducing their positions in the indian economy and redirecting capital back towards the us as rates rise there he welcomed the use of exchange rate flexibility to help the economy adjust to the changing global scenario and stressed the importance of further structural reforms to enhance competitiveness and reduce the import export gap which would also ease pressure on the rupee to depreciate further commenting on the session karan shah coo mdae said at mdae our focus is on providing our students unique and effective learning opportunities that extend beyond the classroom and into the real world we were privileged to host a noted and renowned economist like andreas bauer at our institute his insights and knowledge about the many aspects and factors that weight on the indian and global economy have enlightened our students and also helped all of us understand the steps and measures that can be taken in the coming months towards helping the growth of the economy

2018 bloomberg finance lp stocks finished the week on a high note as cautious optimism from earlier in the week ended with solid gains buying momentum continued amid news of a deal to temporarily reopen the u s government positive commentary from the administration on the u s china trade front and a report that the fed may keep more bonds in its portfolio than previously thought the administration and congress struck a deal to end the partial government shutdown for three weeks while the funding is only temporary and the jury is still out on a final deal lawmakers have taken a concrete step on the path to resolving the issue the announcement confirmed hopes that had helped the market rise in morning trading and comes as companies have increasingly been voicing worries about the shutdown costing them money or having the potential to the market also gained support after treasury secretary steven mnuchin told reuters that the united states and china were making a lot of progress on talks to end the ongoing trade war that has sparked worries about global economic growth and weighed heavily on companies outlooks his comments served as a counterpoint to less optimistic talk from commerce secretary wilbur ross this was the fifth straight week of gains for the dow jones industrial average marking a solid start to the new year fed s bond portfolio in focus meanwhile the wall street journal reported that fed officials are closer to ending the central bank s bond portfolio wind down it said officials are near a decision to maintain a bigger portfolio than they had thought when they started shrinking those holdings two years ago while the fed s interest rate hike trajectory has been closely scrutinized the unwinding of its balance sheet has also been a form of hawkish monetary policy so the market appears to be interpreting the news of the fed potentially keeping a larger balance sheet as bullish when the fed lets more bonds onto the market that tends to weigh on bond prices which then causes yields to rise and increases borrowing costs the central bank bought the bonds as part of its quantitative easing program designed to stimulate the economy by pushing up bond prices and lowering yields which kept borrowing costs lower tech rally continues tech stocks performed well again on friday with the tech heavy nasdaq outperforming the two other main u s indices this capped a week of generally solid performance among tech companies after mostly strong economic reports set up the sector nicely ahead of expected earnings reports next week from apple

short of analyst expectations fed meeting on deck the fed is scheduled to conclude its two day january meeting on wednesday based on futures market activity it looks like investors and traders are expecting the central bank to stand pat on interest rates that would jibe with recent commentary from fed officials that policy makers can be patient with any potential rate hikes because inflation is tame still it could be interesting to try to read the tea leaves in the language accompanying the fed s interest rate decision investors may be looking for clues as to the fed s thinking on the impact of the ongoing trade war with china as well as what monetary policy officials make of any lingering effects of the partial government shutdown and the potential for economic damage if it resumes one effect that the shutdown has had is to delay economic data that means the fed like company executives investors analysts and economists has been flying partially blind when it comes to making data dependent decisions economic data and earnings one big report that investors likely won t be seeing on time is the government s first estimate of q4 gross domestic product the gdp reports are among the biggest economic data news events for investors and traders but even with the temporary government reopening they will likely have to wait given the length of the shutdown how long employees have been furloughed and how long it takes to cobble together the gdp report from other data sets that are also incomplete because of the shutdown while the gdp report leaves a big hole in the economic data calendar investors are scheduled to still have plenty to chew on notable economic reports next week include indexes on consumer confidence and manufacturing as well as the monthly nonfarm payrolls report that last one is likely to be especially closely watched as the labor market is a key barometer for economic health and average hourly earnings form an important part of inflation expectations as if investors didn t already have enough on their plate there is a slate of major companies reporting quarterly results in coming days those include caterpillar which has been closely watched as a barometer for global growth potential amid the continued trade dispute between china and the united states boeing results are also on tap the world s largest aircraft manufacturer has warned that the government shutdown could end up hurting its business as well as that of the overall airline industry so it could be interesting to see whether company executives discuss this further especially in light of friday s news of a temporary reopening other major companies on tap next week include at t verizon tesla amazon mcdonald s and lockheed martin volatility eased as the week ended with the cboe volatility index falling back below 18 it had been above 20 earlier in the week amid concerns about global economic data and a possible u s china impasse on trade still with all these earnings and a fed meeting coming up it seems unlikely that the cboe volatility index would come down much further anytime soon the dollar also lost a bit of ground friday falling nearly 1 by the close to below 96 the dollar might have seen some pressure from that wall street journal article about the fed s potential balance sheet plans a weaker dollar if it continues could be another boost for u s stocks as it can help make prices for u s goods more attractive abroad the lower dollar also might be giving crude a slight boost though concerns about venezuela also could have been at play see fig 1 data source cme group chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade reading between the lines with a bevy of large companies reporting quarterly results in coming days including global economic bellwether caterpillar now may be a good time for the market to glean some insight into two of the highest profile issues of the day the economic effects of the u s china trade war and the partial u s government shutdown the trade dispute has been going on long enough that companies may talk about it in their earnings releases but investors may also want to pay attention to executive commentary during conference calls as they might provide what analysts call color on how the issue is affecting their business or how they think it might affect it in the future and those conference calls with analysts and investors may also provide more clarity on executives thinking on whether the government shutdown has impacted their businesses grounded flying is a great way to

summary the results of the ecb survey of professional forecasters spf for the first quarter of 2019 show downward revisions to inflation and real gdp growth expectations particularly in the near term hicp inflation expectations stood at 1 5 1 6 and 1 7 for 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively longer term inflation expectations were also revised down to 1 8 from 1 9 expectations for real gdp growth stood at 1 5 1 5 and 1 4 for 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively expectations for real gdp growth in the longer term were also revised down to 1 5 unemployment rate expectations were broadly unchanged and continued to point to further falls towards a longer term unemployment rate of 7 5 table 1 results of the spf in comparison with other expectations and projections annual percentage changes unless otherwise indicated 1 longer term expectations refer to 2023 2 as a percentage of the labour force 1 inflation expectations revised down the results for the first quarter of 2019 show average hicp inflation expectations of 1 5 1 6 and 1 7 for 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively see chart 1 relative to the previous survey this represents downward revisions of 0 2 percentage points p p for 2019 and 0 1p p for 2020 expectations for 2021 were surveyed for the first time the revisions to the expected profile for overall hicp inflation likely reflected to a large extent downward revisions to the expected oil price which for the first half of 2019 stood 17 lower in euro terms than in the previous survey as well as downward revisions to expectations for underlying inflation the latest spf results for inflation in 2019 and 2020 are comparable with the expectations reported in other surveys see table 1 average expectations for inflation excluding energy food alcohol and tobacco hicpx were revised down to stand at 1 3 1 5 and 1 6 for 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the latest spf profile represents downward revisions of 0 1p p for 2019 and 0 2p p for 2020 however when calculated using the unrounded results the downward revision for 2020 was a little smaller than that for 2019 see chart 1 chart 1 inflation expectations overall hicp and hicp excluding energy food alcohol and tobacco annual percentage changes the reported probability distributions continued to indicate relatively elevated uncertainty around expected inflation in two years time although the downside balance of risks receded a little the width of the forward looking probability distributions indicates the perceived degree of overall uncertainty whereas the asymmetry of the distributions indicates whether that uncertainty is more concentrated on higher or lower outturns i e it measures the perceived balance of risks for the calendar years 2019 and 2020 the aggregate probability distributions shifted to the left mirroring the reductions in the point forecasts see chart 2 at the two year horizon forecasters probability distributions remained wide by historical standards suggesting that uncertainty about future inflation outcomes at this horizon remained elevated the balance of risks remained skewed towards the downside though to a much lesser extent than seen over the period 2016 17 respondents qualitative comments also tended to discuss downside risks which were mainly seen as stemming from the downside risks to economic growth chart 2 aggregate expected probability distributions for

expectations revised down to 1 8 the average point forecast for inflation in the longer term 2023 was revised down to 1 8 from 1 9 in the previous survey compared with the cross sections of responses in the previous survey there was a drop in the proportion of respondents reporting a longer term forecast of 1 9 and at the same time an increase in the proportion of respondents reporting 1 7 see chart 3 other summary statistics also pointed to lower longer term inflation expectations the median point forecast decreased from 1 9 to 1 8 while the mean of the expected probability distribution

annual percentage changes as with shorter term inflation expectations perceptions of overall uncertainty remained high with the balance of risks remaining to the downside although the width of forecasters probability distributions for inflation in the longer term narrowed slightly it still remained high indicating elevated uncertainty echoing the pattern for two year inflation expectations the balance of risks remained to the downside see chart 5 but to a lesser extent than seen over the period 2016 17 this result is part of a more general picture seen in recent years with the longer term balance of risks remaining tilted towards more adverse economic outcomes across all main survey variables i e towards slower growth higher unemployment and lower inflation chart 5 aggregate

gdp growth expectations revised down expectations for real gdp growth stood at 1 5 1 5 and 1 4 for 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively see chart 6 that implies downward revisions of 0 3 p p and 0 1 p p for 2019 and 2020 respectively longer term growth expectations were also revised down by 0 1 p p to 1 5 respondents largely explained revisions for 2019 by reference to the disappointing economic data at the end of 2018 and therefore less momentum going into 2019 as well as lower global activity weighing on trade nevertheless many forecasters pointed out that they see the current slowdown in quarterly growth as partly driven by temporary special factors and expect some pick up during 2019 the latest spf results for 2019 and 2020 are broadly comparable with those published in other surveys see table 1 in line with the downward revisions to point forecasts also the probability distributions surrounding them also shifted more towards lower values for 2019 and 2020 respondents continue to assign the highest likelihood to outcomes between 1 5 and 1 9 but the expected probability of gdp growth above 1 5 was revised down from 76 to 53 for 2019 and from 64 to 50 for 2020 see chart 7 chart 6 expectations for real gdp growth annual percentage changes risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth were seen as being to the downside but have faded somewhat compared to the previous round especially in the longer term at all horizons the trend in perceived balance of risks as measured by the asymmetry of the forecast distributions has been one of normalisation from the strong downside risks recorded in 2016 in the latest survey the longer term distribution was close to symmetrical indicating broadly balanced risks see chart 8 the qualitative risks mentioned were predominantly to the downside and again related to the external environment negative impacts from a hard brexit were the most cited downside risk in addition to that many respondents referred to the same downside risks as in the previous survey round namely a further escalation of the trade conflict between the united states and china and the risk that the slowdown in china would turn out stronger than expected and spill over to other emerging economies on the upside a few forecasters mentioned that activity could recover more than in the current baseline should us china trade tensions be resolved

expectations for the unemployment rate percentages of the labour force the balance of risks remained to the upside and longer term unemployment rate expectations were unusually uncertain at all horizons the probability distributions remained skewed towards higher unemployment rate outcomes indicating that the balance of risks is to the upside see chart 10 and chart 11 as with other variables across horizons forecasters uncertainty about the unemployment rate in the future as measured by the width of their probability distributions has been greater since the financial crisis than it was

until 2020 and then start to slow the mean expectation for the rate on the ecb s main refinancing operations was for it to remain at 0 0 in the near term increasing to 0 35 in 2020 and then to 0 74 in 2021 see panel a of chart 12 both the aggregate expectation for the near term quarterly profile and the expected policy rate for 2020 have been revised down compared to the previous survey round the average expected usd eur exchange rate fell at all horizons but more so in the nearer term thus relative to that lower starting point the expected pace of future appreciation has increased for third quarter of 2019 while remaining broadly unchanged at all other horizons see panel b in chart 12 us dollar denominated oil prices per barrel were expected to average 63 6 in 2019 64 3 in 2020 and 66 in 2021 this implies that forecasters expected prices to be between 14 3 and 19 8 lower at all horizons than they had expected in the previous survey see panel c of chart 12 when combined with expectations of a weaker usd eur exchange rate especially in the near term these results imply a profile for the oil price in euro that is on average around 15 lower than in the previous survey on average annual growth in compensation per employee was expected to be 2 3 in 2019 2 4 in 2020 and 2 3 in both 2021 and 2023 which is higher at all horizons except the longer term than in the previous

when president joão lourenço attended the world economic forum wef in the swiss town of davos last january he suggested that the winds of change were blowing in angola his message to investors was clear the economic outlook looks bleak but angola s poor record with corruption its over reliance on oil and mismanagement of public funds is over andheis the one to steer the ship around while in davos he met with key stakeholders including christine lagarde the managing director of the international monetary fund imf the prime minister of portugal antonio costa and sergey ivanov the chief executive officer of russia s diamond miner alrosa this year however he will not attend have the winds stopped blowing or has the ship been hijacked the strange cases of dr jekyll and mr hyde advertisement skepticism about the new president and his policies is growing africa confidentia wrote this month that his honeymoon was coming to an end as public focus shifts to the economy economics professor justino pinto de andrade atuniversidade catolica de angolatoldthe africa reportin september that he doubts how the culture of patronage has changed given that lourenço has surrounded himself with the same people as dos santos even marcolino moco who lourenço has appointed as non executive director of state owned energy company sonangol in september 2018 also made headlines when he in an interview to paris basedjeune afriquethreatened to resign if lourenço did not keep his promises lourenço s positioning as a politician of modest origins and stated determination to eradicate corruption at the highest levels is starting to disappoint key figures of the former regime remain as influential as ever in spite of the apparent purge during which lourenço sacked the children of the former president josé eduardo dos santos from their positions at sonangol and the sovereign wealth fund fsdea most concerning so far has been lourenço s public protection of manuel vicente who was chief executive officer of sonangol from 1999 to 2012 and then vice president of angola until 2017 in fact many suspected vicente not lourenço would succeed dos santos but a criminal case in portugal against the former halted those ambitions just before wef in 2018 lourenço lambasted portugal s attorney general for charging vicente on suspicion of bribery and money laundering and demanded that he be tried in angola instead specifically vicente is suspected of bribing portuguese prosecutor orlando figueira eur763 500 to drop charges of money laundering against him in 2011 that investigation was in relation to a purchase of a eur4 million property in estoril portugal in 2007 vicente has always denied wrongdoing one month after wef portugal agreed to angola s demands figueira however was sentenced to six years and eight months in prison in december 2018 the portuguese prosecutors said in their ruling that it was evident that vicente was the owner of portmill limited andportmill limitada two companies at the heart of the case and in which vicente has held stakes according to portuguese media angola s attorney general has said that vicente will be able to answer to charges five years after his mandate ended which will be in 2022 although vicente is no longer in the government he remains a close ally of both carlos saturnino sonangol s new chairman and josé de lima massano the governor of the central bank banco nacional de angola bna since october 2017 when he was appointed by dos santos and according to an article in thefinancial timesarticle from last september vicente continues to be lourenço s advisor advertisement what is more other members of the triumvirate a term commonly used to describe the three most powerful members of the dos santos regime outside the presidential family which includes vicente as well as general manuel hélder vieira dias júnior kopelipa and general leopoldino fragoso do nascimento dino have remained in powerful positions despite angolan law barring public officials from having commercial interests all three have admitted to holding shares in cobalt international energy a texas based oil company that filed for bankruptcy at the u s bankruptcy court in the city of houston in december 2017 after a deal to sell concessions to sonangol fell through a year earlier according tomail guardianin 2012 they allegedly also played a central role in the downfall of banco espirito santo de angola in 2014 a subsidiary of portugal s banco espirito santo through toxic debt that had been contracted toportmill investimentos e telecomunicações but a raft of other investigations and publications by reputable online media outlets also allege that they held stakes in a raft of subsidiaries and offshore companies connected to sonangol kopelipa the former head of the president s security cabinet and widely considered one of the country s wealthiest men is also married to welwitschia tchizé dos santos another of the former president s daughters portuguese authorities last year confirmed investigating allegations against him relating to money laundering specifically in relation to transactions he made between 2006 and 2013 to offshore accounts in the british virgin islands at the time kopelipa was head of the national reconstruction office grn which was in charge of improving infrastructure many millions of u s dollars were spent on brazilian and chinese construction projects and yet angola s transportation network remains derelict in many parts of the country similar procedures are yet to be confirmed in angola although both kopelipa and dino have been removed from their positions in the security apparatus by lourenço french connections and arms deals while lourenço has taken a tough stance against portugal relations have warmed with another european power france total has already announced a series of new investments in the country pushing out swiss commodity trader trafigura which up until last year had held a near monopolistic position in the country this came after lourenço in december 2017 set up a working group to review the oil sector and improve the current conditions of investment in the oil and gas industry in january 2018 sonangol called for new tenders hinting that trafigura s long running but opaque position was likely over although the details of the contracts with total are scarce they are likely to be on par with that of trafigura s which was worth usd450 million in 2017 although total has been present in angola for a long time the french oil major is now taking a more active role in the country s extractive sector underscored by its decision in may 2018 to launch the zinia 2 deep offshore development in block 17 along with several other oil majors including anglo dutch bp and the u s headquartered exxonmobil advertisement but angola has also made deals with other companies with links to france one of them is uae based privinvest which in september 2016 was reported to have signed a deal with angola worth usd495 million to provide 17 patrol boats and a promise of technology transfers that would enable the construction of naval vessels in angola to do this privinvest would work with simportex a state owned enterprise soe that operates under the direction of the angolan ministry of defence anafrica confidentialarticle noted in february 2017 that the deal bore strong resemblance to another deal privinvest had signed with mozambique a few years earlier that deal is currently being tried in u s courts after jean boustani a privinvest executive along with 12 others was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering in december 2018 and january this year respectively reportedly this was in co operation with former senior executives of swiss bank credit suisse and russian bank vtb who were also charged suspected of having facilitated improper payments to mozambican officials and the country to subscribe to more debt than it could realistically manage allegedly privinvest founder iskandar safa was at the heart of the mozambican deal thewall street journalreported in november 2016 that credit suisse became involved in the deals in 2012 when the lender began discussions with defense contractor iskandar safa who negotiated a deal to supply mozambique with military and surveillance equipment through his company privinvest in the two years following credit suisse along with vtb and french bank bnp raised usd2 billion in bonds and loans for mozambican soes loans which more than doubled mozambique s government guaranteed debt leading to a series of defaults apparently proceeds from the deals went straight from the banks to privinvest rather than the state owned companies that had borrowed the money reported wsj the questions around the angolan deal are now beginning to gain momentum firstly because there is no publicly available business plan which could outline how the apparently large number of boats will be manned by the 1 000 or so strong angolan sailors considered a low number and the navy s inexperience in building ships secondly the deal was signed at a time when angola s finances are poor while they were signed under dos santos lourenço was minister of defence at the time this means that he was likely privy to the business deals set up by his ministry although the extent of his involvement is unclear notwithstanding the privinvest order replaced another one simportex had signed with the brazilian navy to supply seven macaé class patrol ships for usd170 million worth noting is that the macaé ships are constructed in brazil but designed byconstruction mécanique de normandie cmn a french subsidiary of privinvest shipbuilding group cmn was the same company that was to supply naval vessels and build a shipyard in mozambique at the time simportex was managed by a close associate of kopelipa luís manuel da fonseca de sotto mayor pizarro further he was one of scores of other military officers promoted to the rank ofbrigadeiroin september 2017 advertisement new money flows in while debt grows meanwhile money and credit continues to flow in as lourenço s early announcements and actions to sideline the former president s family likely fueled optimism among international investors during the first two quarters of 2018 angola received credit pledges worth over usd1 billion from western banks including a usd700 million loan from credit suisse in may bna raised over usd2 billion in a two tranche eurobond note of 10 year and 30 year maturities the bonds were oversubscribed reflecting strong optimism about angola s new beginning under lourenço in december the imf finally signed off on a three year extended credit facility of usd3 7 billion the washington based financier would immediately disburse usd900 million to support the government s budget and massive expenditure programme that added to the growing mountain of debt that angola subscribed to in 2018 a lot of which will eventually be guaranteed by the government and consequently the angolan tax payer international credit rating agency moody s investors service echoed this concern when it at the end of april downgraded angola s investment rating from b2 to b3 with a stable outlook warning against the country s growing debt burden which it said presented high liquidity risks in the medium term the imf also noted this in its review in december 2018 which estimated angola s debt to gdp at 90 per cent it was just over 62 per cent of gdp one year earlier other macro economic indicators underscore the growing concerns the subscription to new debt is mainly a reprofiling of maturing obligations while the drop in average oil prices in 2014 severely damaged the country s reserves of u s dollars essential for imports and maintaining the stability of thekwanza which the bna floated in january 2018 furthermore the country has been struggling to get out of a recession even though oil prices have somewhat rebounded over the past two years although the world bank projects angola s economy will grow by 1 8 per cent this year it will take a lot of discipline on behalf of the finance ministry to maintain a lid on spending to prevent the deficit from spiraling again added to that is that sonangol the cash cow of the government has persistently missed its revenue targets since 2014 while continuing to sign up to new debt which it has struggled to repay furthermore the state budget for this year was calculated on average crude oil prices at usd68 per barrel according to influential magazineafrica confidential an optimistic projection given that average prices of brent crude were in mid january just above usd61 per barrel hour of reckoning advertisement that lourenço is continuing to trade with the same individuals and companies that have been implicated in such a massive corruption investigations places major doubts on his true intentions more people are beginning to wonder whether the initial corruption investigations against dos santos were just for show given that no one has yet been tried let alone convicted an amnesty bill introduced last year which allowed wealthy angolans to repatriate stolen public funds without running the risk of any criminal prosecution has now expired but there have been no reports of such funds having been repatriated under the amnesty over the past year angola s engagement with companies that helped mozambique s debt spiral while raising a lot of debt on capital markets is concerning especially given angola s increasingly bleak economic outlook the economy remains very dependent on china which accounts for most of its oil exports as part of the country s debt repayments to beijing meanwhile the global economy is showing strong signs of slowing down with demand declining in china in addition the now record long u s government shutdown will seriously slow growth forecasts for that country some are saying it will grow by 0 per cent this year indicating that the prices of oil will not pick up in the one to two year outlook that will have knock on effects on the angolan economy and its inability to generate revenue it may be time to replace your economic adviser mr president

this story corrects employer of neil shearing in par 7 by jonathan cable london reuters central banks may be about to face one of their biggest challenges yet global economic growth is slowing but they have struggled to build up their policy arsenals since the last crisis to effectively deal with another one the u s china trade war worries about britain s imminent departure from the european union a potential recession in italy and unrest in south america all pose risks for the global economy while the u s federal reserve embarked on its current tightening cycle back in december 2015 the european central bank bank of england and bank of japan still have interest rates at or near rock bottom policymakers want to start raising borrowing costs so they have more room to manoeuvre if there is another downturn but they risk fanning the slowdown hundreds of economists polled by reuters this month think is already underway central banks are also facing increasing pressure from governments to keep policy loose bringing their independence into question u s president donald trump has taken a swipe at the fed italy has put pressure on the ecb to extend its asset purchases and indian prime minister narendra modi has made it clear to the reserve bank of india that he wants stimulative monetary policy ahead of national elections in may with the global economy likely to slow over the coming quarters it seems more likely that central banks will continue to come under fire from populist leaders said neil shearing group chief economist at ing but most central banks target inflation not growth tighter policy usually strengthens currencies while reducing consumer and business spending which should keep inflation lower but it also risks curtailing what is pretty scant growth in many countries the bank of japan has been targeting inflation of 2 percent for years without success it is not expected to start normalizing its extremely loose monetary policy until 2020 or later ecb president mario draghi may also have to wait a long time before policy is tightened he acknowledged on thursday that growth in the euro zone was likely to be weaker than previously expected although the bank stuck to its guidance that it intends to raise interest rates later this year for the first time in a decade it is now expected to wait until the fourth quarter to raise its deposit rate however later than thought a month ago only 36 of 65 economists polled by reuters this month were confident the ecb would be able to raise rates before the next downturn the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties draghi told a news conference citing trade and geopolitical threats emerging market volatility and brexit britain is due to leave the european union in a little over two months but there is still huge uncertainty about what relationship the two sides will have come brexit day on march 29 bank rate in the uk has been at just 0 75 percent since august and in a reuters poll this month expectations for a hike next quarter were pushed back to july at the earliest as the potential for a no deal brexit remains high prime minister theresa may is engaged in a last ditch bid to win support for a tweaked divorce deal after parliament this month crushed the original plan in the biggest defeat in modern british history her finance minister philip hammond said the economy would suffer severe damage if the united kingdom left the eu without a deal that would leave little scope for the boe to be tightening policy anytime soon across the ocean median predictions suggest the fed will raise rates twice this year although nearly one third of 105 economists polled by reuters predicted the u s central bank would either hike rates only once or keep the fed funds rate unchanged at 2 25 2 50 percent in 2019 u s monetary policy tightening is pretty much over and the ecb seems set to miss the boat altogether in this cycle said andrew kenningham chief euro zone economist at capital economics a further escalation in the trade war president trump is waging on china the world s second biggest economy would likely lead to an even sharper global slowdown this year economists said under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising u s tariffs china s economy cooled in the fourth quarter reducing 2018 growth to a near three decade low and pressuring beijing to roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper slowdown reporting by jonathan cable editing by hugh lawson

infrastructure continue to drive growth across our categories in our consumer segment we had strong u s consumption growth and our asia pacific region had another year of outstanding growth in our flavor solutions segment we continue to win with customers driving base business and new product growth we also continued our progress on expanding our portfolio with flavor growth a pure and low margin ingredient business we have a full year of our frank s and french s brand impacting our business not only in retail condiments and sauces and branded treats service but now in other categories as well with our frank s expansion beyond liquids growth in these brands accelerated over the course of the year and we re excited about their trajectory overall we re confident that the breadth and reach of our portfolio continues to position us to fully meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business heading into 2019 i m confident our momentum will continue this morning i will begin with fourth quarter results reflect on our 2018 achievements and then share with you some of our 2019 business plan after that i will turn it over to mike who will go to more depth on the quarter end results and the details of our 2019 guidance let s start with our fourth quarter results on slide 6 starting with our top line versus the year ago period we grew sales 1 for the total company including a 1 unfavorable impact from currency in constant currency we grew sales 2 with all regions in both segments contributing to the increase despite the significant trade inventory reductions in the u s sales growth was driven by brand marketing support expanded distribution new products and pricing in our consumer segment we grew our constant currency sales 2 in the fourth quarter in the americas we grew 1 driven by pricing we believe we substantially under shipped consumer consumption due to trade inventory reductions we estimate this resulted in the negative 3 impact to the americas growth rate for the quarter a portion of this reduction was due to a change in a large retail replenishment system which caused supply chain with disruption in november we continue to work collaboratively with this retailer restock their stores overall this customer as well as some other retailers the trade inventory reductions resulted in significant out of stock situations on high margin quality items therefore negatively impacting our fourth quarter adjusted operating income despite these out of stocks our iri data shows u s prices in seasonings scanner sales through multi outlets grew approximately 3 for both the category and mccormick branded supported by strong holiday advertising and merchandising execution and reflected improving share trends additionally we had strong growth in unmeasured channels including club e commerce and hispanic retail chains we also had strong consumption growth in other parts of our u s branded portfolio and combined with spices and seasonings we achieved our best fourth quarter consumption performance over the last five years our fourth quarter iri data shows total u s branded measured consumption excluding frank s and french s grew 4 and we estimate including unmeasured channels total consumption grew 5 we re seeing accelerated consumption trends driven by strong marketing and merchandising as well as new distribution mccormick branded dry recipe mixes stubb s and kitchen basics stocks and broths all had high single digit consumption growth with dry recipe mix and stubb s outpacing their respective categories and kitchen basic going in line in its category we re also seeing accelerating trends for frank s redhot sauce and french s since we acquired these brands during the fourth quarter our iri data shows frank s consumption grew 9 outpacing its category we continued our sequential improvement on french s mustard mustard volume consumption grew in the quarter and total dollar consumption growth was in line with the category this was the best performance of both frank s and french s mustard since the acquisition in europe middle east and africa the emea region constant currency consumer sales growth was driven by new products an increase in brand marketing support and continued momentum in france and in the asia pacific region our consumer segment momentum continued with double digit constant currency growth and increases across all categories and channels the fourth quarter constant currency sales growth was the best sales performance in both regions for the year turning now to the flavor solutions segment we grew sales 3 in constant currency in the fourth quarter with all three regions benefiting from higher volume in the americas we grew in all trend areas such as snack seasoning and savory flavors we continue to work with our customers particularly those experiencing several historic challenges to provide flavor solutions that deliver clean label and better for you attributes across all regions we grew with quicksilver s restaurants driven by both new customers and new products as well as existing business and as we continue to refine and optimize our portfolio the fourth quarter as well as the full year is impacted by the exit of lower margin business our fourth quarter adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share results had significant negative impact from the trade inventory reductions i mentioned a moment ago but the bottom line our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of 1 67 compared to 1 54 in the fourth quarter of 2017 this increase of 8 was driven primarily by favorable adjusted income tax rate and included an unfavorable impact from currency moving from our fourth quarter results i m pleased to share performance for the full fiscal year starting with our strong financial results as seen on slide 7 we drove 11 constant currency sales growth with the incremental sales from our acquired frank s and french s brands contributing 8 of this growth our underlying base growth increased 3 driven by new products brand marketing investments expanded distributions and pricing actions to offset material cost increases our consumer segment grew sales 10 in constant currency led by the frank s and french s acquisition impact and underlying base growth driven by the u s and china constant currency sales growth in our flavor solutions segment was 11 also led by incremental sales from frank s and french s all three regions delivered flavor solutions base growth including our exit of some lower margin business we grew constant currency adjusted operating income 19 driven by higher sales and 180 basis points adjusted gross margin expansion from cci led savings and our portfolio shift this increase combined with a lower adjusted effective tax rate was partially offset by higher interest expense and shares outstanding drove 17 increase in adjusted earnings per share to 4 97 for fiscal 2018 this increase in includes the impact of favorable currency exchange rates versus last year with higher sales cci and portfolio shift we increased our adjusted operating margin to 17 4 which was a 110 basis point expansion from last year we expanded adjusted operating margin in both of our segments and in record high we re also making investments to drive continued growth we reached a record 118 million of annual cost savings led by our cci program our fuel for growth and are well on our way toward exceeding our full year 400 million goal and we realized 344 million over the past three years 2018 was the seventh consecutive year of record cash flow from operation ending the year at 821 million we re making great progress with our working capital improvement and expect the programs we have put in place to continue the momentum into 2019 at year end our board of directors announced a 10 increase in the quarterly dividend marking our 33rd consecutive year of dividend

to our acquisition plan importantly we have achieved year one sales and earnings per share accretion expectations with strengthening distribution category management effective brand marketing investments and innovation we re successfully growing frank s and french s as mike will mention in more detail we ve also made great progress in paying down our acquisition debt and finish the year ahead of our debt to ebitda target a key driver of sales growth was our brand marketing which was up 18 over 2017 our leadership in digital was reworded again in 2018 with recognition as the top 3

around the world to a single global platform including starting the replacement process of our existing erp system this will allow us to align our global operating model end to end processes simplify our work better manage risks and importantly to enable growth in 2018 we continue to invest further on our global footprint by increasing our capacity to support our growth in the asia pacific zone we

which is a testament to our emphasis on embracing and leveraging diversity and inclusion globally mike will deliver our 2019 guidance in a few moments but i d like to mention a few highlights related to our sales growth and plan and provide some summary comments on slide 10 as the foundation of our sales growth rate is the rising global consumer demand for great taste and healthy eating consumers have increased interest in creating flavor experiences of bold which authentic flavors while also demanding convenience additionally consumers are focused on fresh natural and recognizable ingredients with greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food flavor continues to be an advantaged global category and our products inspire flavor exploration and are the essential complement to fresh real food we deliver flavor across all markets and all channels and are aligned with the consumers demand for flavor convenience health and sustainably minded business practices our alignment

segments we have confidence in our ability to drive sales through strong brand marketing program continued focus on customer intimacy our opportunities to expand distribution and of course new products new products are integral to our sales growth in 2018 8 of our sales were from product launches in the last three years in 2019 we expect new product sales growth to be even higher because in 2018 we refocused on integrating and growing frank s and french s in our consumer segment new product innovation is an important way to differentiate our brand and stay relevant with the consumers we have a robust global pipeline of new product launches in 2019 that resonates brand inspire flavor exploration and experimentation and meet the demand for convenience health and transparency and in our

it is now my pleasure to turn it over to mike for additional remarks on our 2018 financial results and the details on our 2019 guidance mike mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks lawrence and good morning everyone i will now comment on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as providing more detail on our 2019 outlook starting on slide 13 during the fourth quarter we grew sales 2 in constant currency both our consumer and flavor solutions segment delivered top line constant currency growth in each of our three regions the consumer segment grew sales 2 in constant currency this growth was driven by all three regions with strong growth in asia pacific and emea on slide 14 consumer segment sales in the americas rose 1 in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2017 this increase was driven by pricing actions volume growth was flat due to trade inventory reductions as mentioned by lawrence in emea constant currency consumer sales were up 3 from a year ago primarily driven due to broad based volume and product mix growth driven by brand marketing support as well as new products in the u k and continued momentum in the organic product line in france partially offsetting this growth was the pricing impact of trade promotional activities related to new products we grew consumer sales in the asia pacific region 10 in constant currency led by china growth with strength in new world flavor sauces ketchup chicken bouillon as well as herbs and spices turning to our flavor solutions segment and slide 17 we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 3 which was attributable to broad based growth across all regions in the americas flavor solutions constant currency sales increased 2 driven by increased sales to quick service restaurants and continued flavors momentum this was partially offset by the elimination of some low margin business as well as the global realignment of a major customer sales from the americas to emea in emea we grew flavor solution sales 5 in constant currency this increase was primarily driven by pricing as well as the previously mentioned global realignment of a major customer s sales from the americas to emea in the asia pacific region flavor solutions sales grew 3 in constant currency as higher sales to quick service restaurants were partially driven by the timing of promotional activity across both segments adjusted operating income which excludes the transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of our frank s and french s brands and special charges declined versus the fourth quarter of last year by 3 which included a 1 unfavorable impact to currency in the consumer segment adjusted operating income declined 3 to 228 million which in constant currency was a 2 decline the flavor solutions segment was also down 3 to 70 million in constant currency that was a 1 decrease the decline in both segments was partially due to unfavorable product mix higher freight costs and investments to drive future growth in the consumer segment the unfavorable mix was primarily driven as lawrence mentioned earlier by lower sales of high margin holiday items due to trade inventory reductions our investments to drive future growth included an increase in brand marketing of 7 or 7 million versus the fourth quarter of last year and we began the process to modernize our information technology systems including the replacement of our erp system additionally the flavor solutions segment had an unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates for the fiscal year the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency was 19 and we expanded adjusted operating income margin 110 basis points with both segments contributing to the growth the consumer segment grew constant currency adjusted operating income 13 while increasing our brand marketing and investments by 18 the flavor solutions segment grew constant currency adjusted operating income 34 versus 2017 our flavor solution strategy to migrate our portfolio to more value added categories is evident in these results the shift in our portfolio combined with cci has increased flavor solutions adjusted operating margin to 14 2 an expansion of 230 basis points in 2018 as seen on slide 22 in the fourth quarter adjusted gross profit margin which excludes transaction and integration expenses declined 30 basis points versus the year ago period driven by unfavorable product mix partially offset by cci cost savings we ended the full year with a 180 basis points increase driven by the accretion impact from the addition of frank s and french s portfolio as well as cci cost savings and favorable product mix across the core business our selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased by 40 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 leverage from sales growth and cci led cost savings was more than offset by increases in both brand marketing and freight expense as well as spending related to our information systems modernization below the operating income line other income increased 7 million the increase in other income was driven due to a gain on the sale of a building we vacated as part of the office consolidation into our new global headquarters which lawrence mentioned earlier the expenses we incurred related to the office consolidation reduced operating income for the year by approximately 4 million turning to income taxes on slide 23 our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 19 which reflects the favorable impact from a lower u s corporate tax rate as compared to 26 2 in the year ago period our fourth quarter adjusted rate was lower than anticipated due to the favorable impact of discrete items principally a higher level of stock option exercises for the full year our adjusted tax rate was 19 6 compared to 26 1 in fiscal 2017 income from unconsolidated operations for both the fourth quarter of 2018 and the full year was comparable to the respective year ago periods for 2019 we expect a low single digit increase in our income from unconsolidated operations at the bottom line as shown on slide 25 fourth quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was 1 67 up 8 from 1 54 for the year ago period mainly due to a favorable investment income tax rate this increase included an unfavorable impact from currency on slide 26 we summarized highlights for cash flow and the year end balance sheet our cash flow provided from operations ended the year at a record high of 821 million compared to 815 million in 2017 for the fiscal year our cash conversion cycle was significantly better than year ago period down 21 days as we executed against programs to achieve working capital reductions such as expanding payment programs with our suppliers and inventory management programs we returned a portion of this cash flow to our shareholders through dividends additionally we reduced our acquisition debt in the fourth quarter by 209 million which brings our total acquisition debt reduction in the fiscal year to 545 million and we have now paid down over 50 of the term notes related to the acquisition we finished the year with a debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of four times which is ahead of our target this strong progress positions us well to achieve our three times target by the end of 2020 our capital expenditures were 169 million in 2018 and included the completion of our regional manufacturing facility in thailand and spending related to our new global headquarters in 2019 we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2018 to support our investments to drive growth particularly the transition of our erp platform we expect 2019 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash making investments to drive growth returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt let s now move to our current financial outlook for 2019 on slide 27 we are well positioned for another year of solid performance with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio effective growth strategies and focus on profit realization as lawrence mentioned we continue to expect solid constant currency growth for fiscal year 2019 we estimate based on prevailing rates a 2 percentage points unfavorable impact from currency rates on net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share we expect the impact of unfavorable currency will be greater in the first half of the year than in the second half at the top line we expect to grow sales 1 to 3 which in constant currency is a 3 to 5 projected growth rate this increase will be entirely organic growth with no incremental impact from acquisitions the growth will be driven primarily by higher volume and product mix as well as the impact of pricing to offset an anticipated low single digit cost increase our 2019 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2018 in part driven by our cci led cost savings we expect to increase adjusted operating income 7 to 9 from 942 million in 2018 which in constant currency is a 9 to 11 projected growth rate and reflects our continued focus on profit realization our cost savings target is approximately 110 million and we expect brand marketing to be comparable to 2018 our 2019 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to approximate 22 base upon our estimated mix of earnings by country in addition to our state tax rates this projection is well within our underlying effective tax rate of 24 due to the favorable impact of discrete tax items which occurred during the first quarter of 2019 related to our entity structure our full year 22 outlook versus our 2018 adjusted effective tax rate of 19 6 is approximately 300 basis point headwind to our 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth our guidance range for our adjusted earnings per share in 2019 is 5 17 to 5 27 this compares to 4 97 of adjusted earnings per share in 2018 and represents a 4 to 6 increase or 6 to 8 in constant currency this increase includes expected significant tax headwind i just mentioned in summary we are projecting solid growth in our 2019 constant currency outlook for sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share following record double digit performance across each objective in 2018 i d like to let you know that we ll be adopting two new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2019 on a retrospective basis with the adoption of these two standards we expect no impact to net income and only a geography shift between income statement line items we also do not anticipate the adoptions will materially impact growth rates or other expectations we provided in our 2019 financial outlook this morning we have provided summary points regarding this topic in the appendix of our presentation and further discussion of these changes will be included in the 10 k we filed this evening on a final note related to our guidance turning to slide 28 i want to discuss our performance versus our constant currency long term financial objectives we evaluate our performance against our long term objectives every several years partially because of the variability which can occur year to year related to acquisition activity as a reminder we have an objective to grow sales 4 to 6 with base business new products and acquisitions each contributing one third so excluding one third from acquisitions our growth expectations will be to grow sales approximately 3 to 4 additionally our objective is to grow adjusted operating income 7 to 9 then by using leverage gained through our capital deployment activities including our share repurchase program our objective is to grow adjusted earnings per share 9 to 11 as we have previously stated after making our frank s and french s acquisition we have curtailed acquisition activity and our share buyback program as we delever and therefore use our cash flow to pay down debt as mentioned earlier we are making significant progress to leveraging and in line with our original plan our acquisition activity and buyback program will remain curtailed in 2019 from a sales perspective our 2019 guidance of 3 to 5 is in line with our long term growth objectives without incremental acquisition growth our adjusted operating income guidance is 9 to 11 which is actually above our long term growth objectives despite these strong operating expectations the adjusted effective income tax rate increase i mentioned before is a significant headwind to our 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth looking at our performance over a 4 year period using the 2019 guidance i ve just reviewed our compounded annual growth rate for 2015 from before the frank s and french s acquisition to 2019 the first full year these brands are in our base are projected to exceed our long term goals for each objective even including the negative effect of currency experienced during this period as lawrence mentioned our foundation is strong our strategy is effective and we are generating results in line with our objectives i d like to now turn it back to lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mike now that mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail i d like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 29 we delivered another year of record results in 2018 despite trade inventory reductions we achieved strong organic sales growth for the year we significantly grew adjusted operating income while also increasing brand marketing and achieved frank s and french s results in line with our plan we ended 2018 with the strongest consumption trend in years in our consumer business and solid growth in every region for flavor solutions our 2019 constant currency outlook reflects strong operating performance driven by our solid foundation and continued momentum our earnings per share growth was robust despite a significant tax headwind and we re confident that 2019 will be another successful year and we will create additional volume and importantly we re continuing to deliver differentiated results while significantly investing for growth to build mccormick of the future and we ll share more about these investments at cagny in a few weeks and now let s turn to your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays please proceed with your question andrew lazar barclays capital analyst good morning everybody lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer good morning andrew mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning andrew lazar barclays capital analyst hi i guess first i m looking at was the replenishment issue that you talked about a key customer or customers were those really just in mccormick s category or categories or is this something you think we ll hear more about from peers as we go forward and then a 3 headwind to americas consumer that you mentioned is obviously a less of headwind to the overall business it still seems like maybe organic sales growth even excluding that might have come in a little short of where like consensus was for organic sales growth in the quarter i wonder if there are any additional areas that came in differently around the top line than may be you anticipated that are worth mentioning thank you lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer thanks andrew i m going to start with the first part of that question the replenishment issue there s been a general trend for all of our customers to be working their inventories lower as you know and others have reported on it the particular issues that impacted us in the fourth quarter were really had two parts to it the first part was the move by a key customer as well and handful of key customers to reduce their inventory levels overall it is on timing for them to do this for our category but it may have made sense for them across their broader store and for us of course the fourth quarter is the real peak and i would expect you to hear from others saying similar things regarding that portion of the trade reduction and i believe actually some of our peers have already commented on this and the costs those who have come ahead of us there was a part of that was unique to us and that there was a large customer who s name i m not going to use that had change in their internal store replenishment system this was actually switched on in error by them and so that had a big impact in that there warehouses and stores did not recognize each other s order numbers and as a result stores were not replenished that s going to be a change that is unique to us this customer is making that transition broadly but it is for our category that was scheduled for much later next year we would have run all the beta tests and so on and would have had a different experience if had done in a different way and again it was an error internal hit that the customer and we are still working through this in a sense that for every order we have to do literally a workaround to get the stores restocked so that part is unique to us we ve highlighted this as a 3 headwind overall to our business in the in our americas business in the quarter we re not rounding up again to get to that number we have a pretty good handle on it on our ability to quantify it was holiday items it was specific customers and we really know what it was mike do you want to go further on that mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer andrew lazar barclays capital analyst great i appreciate the details see you in a couple of weeks lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer great see you andrew lazar barclays capital analyst yes operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with crédit suisse please proceed with your question robert moskow credit suisse analyst hi i guess i have two questions the 9 to 11 constant currency ebit growth target for 2019 now sounds rather aggressive given that what s demonstrated here in fourth quarter is that you ended a vulnerable to a lot of the trends that are happening across the food space you had inventory reductions you mentioned some freight costs and i just want to know how do you get from the sales guide to the ebit guide i know you have your normal cost savings programs but you also mentioned mix was a headwind in fourth quarter why wouldn t it be a headwind in 2019 and then i have a follow up mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer rob this is mike i ll start this one let s talk about fourth quarter first because you talked about when you talked about product mix in the fourth quarter a significant portion of that is really related to the trade inventory issues these are our highest margin holiday items so that was a significant hit to our fourth quarter operating profit we also did take the opportunity in the fourth quarter we just like we did in the third quarter we had some benefits from stock options which is below the operating profit line some of these savings we invested those in brand marketing up 7 we took opportunities started investing in our it refreshment programs so if you look at 2019 though we ve gone from the 3 to 5 down to 9 to 11 we talked about keeping brand marketing flat we took the opportunity as i said in the fourth quarter really invest and drive back consumption in the fourth quarter get it to a level we feel comfortable expanding in 2019 while we are getting to get more effective and we re going to have more working media in 2019 that s going to give us about 100 basis points right there keeping that flat we re also getting more synergies from the frank s and french s the second year that sort of have a wrap from last year and additional frank s and french s synergies our cci focus really is we look at cost of goods sold and sg a we re really leaning in there also and some of the things happen in the fourth quarter we talk about the move into the new building we re not going to have those costs next year so it s a variety of things that aren t going to happen in 2019 that we feel very strongly by giving this guidance robert moskow credit suisse analyst ok and then my follow up is i did an inventory report on the broader group back in october and mccormick popped up as a company that had been shipping at a growth rate that was well above the nielsen measured consumption for quite a while you had called out that there are other channels that are not measured by nielsen so that was a big portion of the disconnect and you also pointed out that you always do a conservative job of assuming inventory reductions during the course of the year so i guess given what happened here in fourth how much comfort you have that you have could visibility of how much inventory is really at the trade and that you head into 2019 and that this will truly prove episodic or have you assumed another inventory burn again in 2019 thanks lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer sure rob i m going to take this to start and mike join me if i miss anything on this but this was an extraordinary situation it s not the normal pattern that we ve experienced normally we see a drawdown in q1 our q1 that coincides with a lot of our customers end of the year and then relative flatness for the rest of the year this impact that happened in fourth quarter was really extraordinary and does not reflect a build of inventory previously this is it s quite discrete with a small set of customers we had one very large customer that had the biggest impact it was devastating to their stores they are it s inventory this was not an intentional move on their part and as a result their stores had tremendous out of stocks through the holiday season and so it s hard to imagine that retailer taking inventory down further than they did because they literally ran themselves out of product in terms of our looking forward we always include in our plans and in our sales guidance level of inventory of drawdown not always but we had for the last several years and we ve included in the guidance for sales for next year further reduction in inventory across the trade not necessarily those customers specifically but this timing that happened both the size and the timing of it and the products involved we re surprised this happened to us at the most sensitive time of year for us as we re coming to not only the peak consumption period but also the cutoff on our fiscal year we don t get a do over on thanksgiving and so this had it really had a big impact for us robert moskow credit suisse analyst ok thanks for the answers operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein please proceed with your question alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst good morning everyone lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer good morning alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst hi could i ask about the flavor solutions business it s up until this quarter it was doing really incredibly well on profit growth top line growth clearly the profits took a half bit of a pause on that trajectory this time around was there something that happened did the contracts got lost or is this just lapping tougher comps from a year ago and what s the prognosis from here does it step down to some of a more normal level can the margins continue to expand thank you and i ll pass it on lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i ll just say a word about this then i m going to give it to mike but the flavor solutions business is always pretty lumpy and so there s more volatility in the quarter to quarter results on that i think if you look at the whole year we re very pleased that we don t see any issue actually are quite pleased with how we come out of the year on flavor solutions and our outlook is as optimistic as it has been mike mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i d say within the flavor solutions business a couple of things happened in the quarter and i mentioned this on the call we have a bit a transactional fx unfavorability which impacted not the whole company too from an operating profit perspective but because of our footprint with some of the currencies but also unfavorable product mix and some as lawrence said flavor solutions can be lumpy and some of our regions the growth was more on core products versus ltos ltos generally have higher margins so you have these sometimes when our customers advertising something we ve done for a long time as the base product that has a lower margin that might have a little bit of a product mix negative so we saw some of that this quarter too alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst thank you very much i ll pass it on operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david driscoll with citi please proceed with your question lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer hey david are you there operator mr driscoll your line is live perhaps you re muted on your end lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer just we go on to the next question and give david the opportunity to come in operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with j p morgan please proceed with your question ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst hi thanks so much a couple for me in each of the last i think seven years by our math your initial guidance for your tax rate has proven a bit conservative meaning you ve guided to a higher tax rate than i guess what you ultimately reported just wondering is there any reason we should think 2019 will be different given history it seems reasonable to expect your tax rate to come in below the 22 you guided to today but just trying to get a feel for what you re thinking there this coming year mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer david this is mike i ll take this one we generally we don t sorry can t i was on ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst close enough i ll take it mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer close enough we know the difference yes we have been favorable on our tax but a big part of that is we don t forecast discrete tax items but if you think about this year i m talking about this year first before i talk about next year before the tax act we might have an underlying rate of 28 to 29 and guidance at the beginning of this year after the tax act was about 24 and we came in slightly below 20 so about a 400 basis points favorability 300 basis points of that was a stock option exercises which one we don t forecast for and we don t know when it s going to happen so there s another 100 basis points of other stuff tax settlements things like that but we really don t forecast discrete tax items for 19 the underlying tax rate is about 24 similar to this year as we kind of go through also a process recently going through the regs that were just released by the department of treasury we did some tax planning and that s why we said look this is significant tax item hitting early in the year we re calling 22 there could be some stock option exercises there could be some other discrete tax items but we want to give you at least a benchmark of what we see is there and hopefully it is favorable but we there s some judgment there ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst that s helpful no very helpful mike my follow up is you talked about low single digit raw material cost inflation for the year forgive me i don t think that includes transportation costs and correct me if i m wrong but you re of the first food companies to really provide detailed guidance for the upcoming calendar year i m just curious on that freight for the transportation logistics whatever you want to sort of defined i don t think raw material necessarily if you re seeing any sort of easing and pressure from that area mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer no we throw it all in there ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst we do ok good mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we throw it all in ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst and if i could ask a quick clarification then just within that just to get a better sense of transportation are you seeing an easing in that particular part of it mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer well we ve seen we know 18 was a significant increase from 17 and we ve had a lot of activities in our north america primarily through cci program to mitigate the cost as we see them going to 2019 but we still do see inflation there lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer we were not seeing an easing there ken goldman j p morgan equity research analyst great thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs please proceed with your question adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer good morning adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst maybe a question just on the trajectory first on organic both on the fourth quarter and then into 19 on the frank s and french s business because they are now in the organic base just trying to make this aggregate that the inventory trade reduction in the quarter which clearly impacted the consumers americas business but would have thought that the frank s and french s now coming into organic would have been would have helped your business reported into more and just help me think about how those business are performing on underlying business it sounded like the trade reductions were more legacy of mccormick guidance lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i m glad you asked that question because in answering a couple of the earlier questions about the inventory reductions we didn t talk about the other side of the of what was happening which is our consumption has been incredibly strong we came out of the year with the strongest consumption performance for a fourth quarter in the last five years it s one of the strongest quarters for a period and that s part of what gives us optimism around 2019 the frank s and french s items were no exception to that so our consumer offtake is as measured through scanner data on frank s was up 9 in the quarter our offtake on mustard was almost flat and if you recall our goal that we announced when we bought this business was that we were going to drive growth on frank s and we were going to stabilize the french s mustard and i think we re making great progress on that and so i think that that consumption trajectory on both the acquired brands and also on our core business gives us confidence in the sales numbers for 2019 mike do you want to make some comments on the inventory mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer well yes let me talk to about in the fourth quarter some of that advertising investment was driving frank s we talked about the first time we advertised in frank s in seven years the new advertising which just dropped this week that s kind of supports the first quarter a lot of new products coming in the first quarter frank s and french s was impacted as lawrence said by the trade inventory reductions though but we expect the strong first quarter from both brands because of the consumption we re seeing adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok and then just on the guidance between the sales and margin expansion goals that you ve laid out is there any notable delineation between the consumer and the flavor solutions business and i e is the base expectation that there s faster growth in flavors or consumer more margin expansion of one versus the other mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer no we generally feel pretty comfortable between the two adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok that s it s very helpful i ll pass it on operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david driscoll with citi please proceed with your question mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer hey david are you there this time david driscoll citi research analyst yes i m here this time i apologize the telecom blitz right there it was like one second before you call my name so ok two questions for you you talked about the erp system we re sensitive to changes in erps can you just walk us through kind of the risk points on when we need to be focused on the big modules and kind of when they come into play and i think you called it out in the fourth quarter as part of it i don t know what s already taken place versus what has to take place on the system change lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer well david as you know this is kind of a two to three year process we re kind of in the early days year anything i wouldn t your guidance considers any expense that are going to occur on erp a lot of it is capital and we talked about in the call we re going to have an increase in capital versus this year our capital this year we have a target of 200 million due to a lot of timing issues it came down to almost about 170 million we don t see it we see some incremental capital investment next year but i wouldn t describe a large impact i mean our guidance is our guidance and it incorporates all those impacts david driscoll citi research analyst let me clarify lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer as we get more detail david i ll commit to give you more detail but as i ve said before we re pretty early days on this but we have made some investments in the fourth quarter to help jump start that david driscoll citi research analyst yes it wasn t really a question on capital spending it was a question on erp systems and the disruptions that they sometimes cause when the execution doesn t go well there s always certain modules within these erp systems that are far more sensitive than other modules and i was just looking for a piece of information related to when the significant modules go into play lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer well if i could just pick this up so as you know these it sounds like you understand exactly what s involved in these projects so there was a long period of scoping of code writing building before you get your first go live on anything so we re in that upfront stage of it right now our first go live is not until 2020 but this year is the year when we do all of the work getting ready and i ll just add to it that we re due for it we did our first sap go live in 2002 we still have done some go lives on sap this year has been a long and drawn out process but once the new system is now become the legacy system sap as you know goes out of maintenance it becomes obsolete in 2023 we want to be ahead of the curve like getting migrating to the next generation of erp not be doing it at the last minute so everybody s going to have to make this anybody is on sap is going to have this transition over the next several years we re really getting started some on it didn t incur some expense but we got in the fourth quarter and will throughout 2019 but we really want we won t get until our first actual go live until 2020 i ll add that it is our plan to move quickly it s taken almost 20 years to roll out sap across our whole company we are not going to take 20 years to do the refresh which will still be on sap product david driscoll citi research analyst kind of like the 20 year comment my second question relates to your flavor solutions it s a follow up to one of the earlier questions but i want to think a little bit longer term flavor solutions margins went from about 7 5 five seven years ago to over 14 a massive increase when i look at this the pie breakdown your ingredients proportion of the flavor solutions is kind of small now so i think that was the low margin stuff that you slowly but surely been exiting and then adding other high margin pieces like flavors lawrence what i don t get a sense on but i get this question a lot from investors is how much more is there to go can you double the size of the flavors portion of flavor solutions and is that high enough margin to keep pushing the segment margin significantly higher over some course of time this isn t a the next year question lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i understand this is a great long term question and i appreciate the opportunity to talk about something besides the inventory reduction in the fourth quarter this is the in fact our strategy that you just described for our flavor solutions segment we are downgrading our portfolio to more of the flavor and seasoning we certainly see value on some of the customer foodservice products and condiments that we do but away from that or come out of the ingredient and spectrum and we see a long runway of opportunity of enhancing our margin from this migration of our portfolio to now value added products you can see from the public company competitors who are more pure play on flavor their margins are significantly higher to us and as we aspire to move more in that direction and i m not sure how high up is but it s a long way from where we are now and there are parts in the other slices of pie too for example in condiments there s low margin condiments and higher margin so obviously we would optimize this as we go david driscoll citi research analyst thank you guys lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer thanks david operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris growe with stifel please proceed with your question chris growe stifel financial corp analyst hi good morning lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer good morning chris chris growe stifel financial corp analyst i had just two questions if i could so the price is a little less than i expected in the fourth quarter i know you talked about some new products and spending around those new products i m sure it was more of effect on weight on pricing as more promotional driven so my question is did pricing line up with cost inflation in the fourth quarter do you expect that 19 or maybe more new product cost is going to weigh on that pricing line overall mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer hey chris this is mike i ll take that if you look at the split by region i don t focus on consumer i mean pricing for consumer is only up 0 2 but in the americas it was up 0 6 and that was covering the cost of inflation some of the pricing we took early in the year recipe mixes asia pacific 1 5 emea where we had really strong overall sales performance from kind of the relaunch of our first choice spice line we had obviously some trade promotional slotting key things like that which is negative on price so emea was negative 2 2 so that s what drove the whole consumer down and that was a significant restage for that region so we don t see we see in 19 our pricing actions the ramp from last year and anything we need to do to cover our low single digit cost inflation we see those covering off lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer right other than the cost of new distribution we don t see any extraordinary pressure on promotion expense if anything to revenue management that s been a net positive for us chris growe stifel financial corp analyst and with pricing also cost inflation in your view that from a higher level in 2019 is that your expectation lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i m sorry i m not sure i got the question could you repeat that chris growe stifel financial corp analyst would do you expect your price realization to offset cost inflation in 2019 from a high level not quarter to quarter that kind of thing but do you expect that we will be able to price to your cost inflation in 2019 lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer yes we also have cci programs things like that to there s a broad basket of tools chris growe stifel financial corp analyst ok yes and just one final one in the fourth quarter i think you had a gain on the sale of a building also had some costs related to moving into the new facility were there cost out of the quarter in this fourth quarter had that benefit of that gain and i m just curious how this applies to the comps for 2019 mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer chris they were in the second half we figured we moved most of the people in the july august september timeframe and had a grand opening actually in october so a lot of those expenses were second half chris growe stifel financial corp analyst and the gain did that more than offset the cost or lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer yes it does yes we said that in the call between net to 2 million mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer 4 million spent hurt operating expense there is a geography difference there that opposite the gain was below the operating profit line but all the expenses were above chris growe stifel financial corp analyst ok that s helpful thank you so much for your time operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rob dickerson with deutsche bank please proceed with your question rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst great thank you good morning hello i have two hopefully it s really quick couple of questions first question is just any color i know you don t always obviously don t guide quarter to quarter but just any color around kind of cadence for 19 well i guess with respect to organic sales trajectory sequentially and then also just a margin it looks like your guidance is implies call it about 100 basis points operating profit margin i know you said earlier in response to a question it s not hard to get there just given keeping the media spend flat i m curious like obviously just every year if you report q4 you re already half of q1 and given this holiday issue and some of the replenishment piece was for your quarter ending in november and then you also have december baked in q1 do some of that some of the replenishment issue flow through into q1 and then does more of the margin expansion more back half loaded just given timing of 18 spend and then also the inventory issue you had in q4 sorry if that s not worthy did you get my point mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer that s right i think we got the concept rob this is mike i ll start this with we do not provide guidance by quarter however talk about 2 fx unfavorable during the year that s really first half loaded so there s really going to be some negative fx there first quarter is our smallest issue as lawrence said smallest quarter right no our first quarter is our smallest quarter of the year we are still working through some of the replenishment issue but we also talked about how the first quarter discrete tax items so that s going to help our tax line we ll make some investments as we talked about before it s really like an it and other things early in the year being the smallest quarter of the year there may be more impact on that but again for the full year 100 basis points increase in operating profit we re comfortable with that lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and i ll say there may be as we look ahead to some events that might happen in this volatile environment such as brexit we may depending on how they are unfolding we may have to incur some expense to prepare us for managing our risks through our brexit for example rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst yes i just mean potential outside total manufacturing sourcing or lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer yes inventory build things like that yes rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst yes ok fair and then second question just more so on rb foods i realized some additional growth coming from non track channels and non track channels it looks like year over year growth definitely so strong or better even with frank s so that s net positive it looked like it peaked more in that august september period year over year and then french s as you said is stabilizing but still a drag so i m just curious with respect to 19 didn t hear a lot or anything on potential innovation around the growing season how do you actually increase momentum behind the french s and then secondly just international opportunity which you didn t discuss upfront on the acquisition i think the last call but didn t hear much of that today i hope that s more cagny related things lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer right yes rob exactly i think we ll cover this more thoroughly at cagny we ll look look at our and we ll talk more about our 2019 plans and beyond at cagny but we re really pleased with the performance of rb foods i don t want to let this go but i m saying that and you mentioned our peak around august actually our consumption on these products increased sequentially quarter by quarter throughout the entire year the fourth quarter consumption was the strongest that we ve had but there was impact from that inventory issue on the purchase frank s and french s brand i actually don t have it at my fingertips but the shipment was the consumer offtake was the strongest that we ve had and we think we ve got good momentum going forward in 2019 on those brands which we re now not really we re not breaking them out because we re treating them just like many of our other major brands in terms of our reporting but when i say major brands these are the second and third largest brands in our portfolio after mccormick so they certainly get a lot of attention mike do you want to rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst fair enough thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jonathan feeney with consumer edge research please proceed with your question jonathan feeney consumer edge research analyst a couple of questions first i guess following up from your conversation with rob and your comment that rob moskow i should say and your comment on consumption it sounds like because i m looking at the measured data it sounds like non measured this was a record q4 for you non measured continues to grow terrifically for you if you could just comment on non measured especially online how that s going fiscal third versus fiscal fourth and then second question is what are the big sources of gross margin mix and within that what impact on the gross margin specifically or how big of an impact could this one set of seasonal high margin items have had on your gross margin broadly it seems like there s other gross margin mix items that are more structural and maybe comment on how those play into your hope your plans for gross margin expansion in 2019 thank you very much lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i m going to start and i m going to pass it over to mike but the strong consumption includes unmeasured channels but we re specifically pointing to the measured channels so that everybody could see it so if you look at the iri data in aggregate over the last going back five years it seems that through measured channels this was the strongest fourth quarter in the last five years and then on top of that we had good performance in our unmeasured channels as well the contributed i think i tried to cover that in my prepared remarks but i want to really underscore that you can see it in the measured data when you look at for us iri the impact jonathan feeney consumer edge research analyst but would that also be true would that also be true that that comment would be also be true on your nonmeasured channels that acceleration there lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i m not sure that the growth rate was higher but it was definitely a contributor to the positive growth and at a higher rate than the scanned sales some just go put that out there now the margin impact is from the again i can t underestimate mike talked about this a little bit this happened at the worst possible time for us and the items that we have the holiday time are very seasonal in nature they are our highest margin part of the portfolio if you thought john you followed us for a long time you see the difference in our margin structure quarter by quarter that s driven by that sort of holiday items when we don t have that that s a big impact on the bottom line mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s basically why i mean there s are a high margin items seems like french s some of the trade inventories and then you say inventory items we talked about too things like the recipe mixes core herbs and spices those are if you look at it quarter by quarter as lawrence said fourth quarter is always our highest quarter and atually late in the quarter is usually higher jonathan feeney consumer edge research analyst mike could i say that was a primary contributor then to gross margin contraction that one issue mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes definitely definitely operator thank you ladies and gentleman our final question for this morning will come from the line of akshay jagdale with jefferies akshay jagdale jefferies analyst thanks for squeezing me in so one follow up goes back to i think andrew s first question i know you don t give quarterly guidance but for the fourth quarter we have the benefit of quarter 3 guidance given how you guide right so the sales growth in the quarter was about 300 basis points below what you had expected so the inventory stuff that s about 100 150 bps it does imply that something else was weaker but it from everything you ve said it sounds to me like the main issue really is still the inventory issue right so can you just help me bridge that because it does look like from a purely quantitative standpoint there are some other factors that have might have been weaker than you would had expected thank you and i ll pass it on mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer akshay this is mike and for the year we gave guidance of 12 to 14 and we came in basically at the bottom of that 11 9 the implied guidance for the fourth quarter was 0 9 to 7 4 pretty big range because we don t take the year guidance down to 1 spread we came in at 0 6 reported so we were right at the bottom the trade inventory programs were 1 5 impact or so when you think about 20 million to 25 million of net sales that would have put us up in that 0 9 to 7 4 so i think we are comfortable with the guidance we were giving for the fourth quarter implicit in our full year guidance so a little bit at the low end of the range but we would have been well within the q4 implied guidance akshay jagdale jefferies analyst got it so overall the main standout is this inventory issue and what gives you confidence is clearly the consumption trends are very very strong and accelerating in many areas that s the main takeaway from your perspective on sales right lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer absolutely that s exactly right because in the long run sales are being followed by consumer and that s why we spent so much time in our remarks today on the consumption trends and while the trade inventory reduction happened at the worst time for us we re very disappointed and the impact that it had at the end of the year our consumer consumption is strong and our international business is strong and our flavor solutions business continues to power on we believe there s a short term challenge and a long term upward trend fueled by alignment of really long term consumer trend a sound strategy and i ll add a talented and engaged workforce and that gives us a lot of confidence in our 2019 operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session today i ll turn the floor back to mr kurzius for any final comments lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer thanks everyone for your questions and for participating on today s call mccormick is a global leader in flavor we re differentiated with a broad and portfolio which continues to drive growth responding to changes in the industry with new ideas innovation and purpose with a keen focus on growth performance and people we continue to perform strong globally and build shareholder value i m pleased with our strong results to start the year and i m confident in our continuing momentum to growth i look forward to reporting to you on the shareholder value we ll continue to create kasey jenkins vice president investor relations thank you lawrence and thanks to all

the speech scroll down for the full text of the governor s remarks and listen to the speech above vpr provided live coverage of the proceedings hosted by jane lindholm and bob kinzel beginning at 2 p m vpr s live coverage of the scott s speech was followed by a response from democratic sen phil baruth chair of the senate education committee the governor s past two budget addresses have resulted insome notable contention with democratic lawmakers namely over education spending scott had said that this year s budget address would also include specifics on his plan to fund waterway cleanup you can also watch the speech via vermont pbs gov phil scott s full prepared remarks mr president madam speaker mr chief justice members of the general assembly distinguished guests and fellow vermonters two weeks ago i stood before you and outlined what i believe are the major challenges we face and opportunities to address them for those who have been here a while i don t have to tell you building the budget is never easy year after year we re faced with many worthy initiatives and programs it s our job to separate our wants from our needs make sure we re meeting our goals determine where we need to do more and where we can get by with less this is the difficult task before us it s a process that forces us to find balance between our hearts and our minds understanding that each dollar we spend comes directly from hardworking vermonters many struggling to get by but i m certain if we build consensus on solutions and compromise when we can t we can come to agreement on a budget that supports everyone by growing our economy making vermont more affordable and protecting the most vulnerable the budget i present today is balanced and spends within our means while investing in both our obligations and areas that will give us the highest return as i ve said many times i believe our biggest threat is our declining labor force it s the root of every problem we face to put this in perspective every county except chittenden has seen a decline in the number of people working every county including chittenden has fewer people available for work this makes it incredibly difficult for businesses to recruit new employees and expand harder for communities to grow and leaves fewer of us to cover the cost of state government this is the problem as our working age population continues to decline we simply need more people helping to pay the bills together we have an opportunity to change this with polices that better prepare students for a career keep more of our kids after graduation provide training for vermonters so they can get a good job and attract new workers and new families to join our communities this is how we can grow our economy and revenues be better able to support the programs we provide today and meet the needs of an uncertain future this work is crucial because despite having a surplus for the first time in many years we still face difficult budgeting decisions put simply the day to day operational costs of state government and increasing payments on our debt exceeded growth in our economy without any new investments just paying the bills we began building this budget with about a 40 million gap that s just our basic obligations debt service pension funding contracted salary increases caseload pressures at ahs clean water and others through this process i challenged my team to think differently to question our assumptions and the way we ve always done it to think outside the box and to innovate so that even with these spending pressures we can make a difference and emerge stronger and more sustainable with this in mind all of us in this chamber today understand the pressures we face with our unfunded liabilities the future financial commitments for pensions and retiree health plans i welcome the opportunity to work together with you and treasurer pearce towards a future when our liabilities are fully funded and i m pleased to say this work is already moving forward in the house appropriations committee my team the treasurer and legislators met to share ideas and collaborate on a proposal which will retire a portion of our debt using 22 2 million from this year s surplus to pay off a loan currently funding health benefits for retired teachers another 2 4 million would be used to put ourselves on a path to pre fund this liability for the first time in history and if successful we will have 75 million in this fund for future retired teachers health care costs by 2025 additionally directing 3 3 million of surplus as a pre payment to the teachers pension fund will further decrease that liability finally we can redirect 50 percent of future year surpluses to the retired state employees health fund to pay those debts as well these are examples of the work we ve done to present a budget to you today that s balanced makes investments to expand our workforce strengthens our communities and supports economic growth in all corners of the state now i know you have your own priorities for this year s budget which is an important part of this process and i look forward to hearing them because we need all ideas on the table to restore our fiscal fundamentals as i said in my inaugural address despite the challenges we face we can be hopeful because we know there s a path forward it starts with making sure we maintain the things that set us apart the health and safety of our communities and our commitment to protecting our neighbors in need i ve long said public safety should be the top priority of any government today keeping people safe is no longer limited to our highways and homes we must also protect vermonters online as cybersecurity threats grow and cause more harm keeping data safe and systems operating is essential to do so i ve called for a one time investment of 2 3 million to strengthen the state s firewall and upgrade critical it infrastructure we must also stay focused on protecting our communities which starts with our children last year we acted quickly to strengthen the safety of school buildings across the state but we have more to do with the same sense of urgency let s use budget adjustment to immediately fund an additional 1 5 million in safety improvements at schools who couldn t secure grants last year we ll also make capital investments to ensure more schools are e9 1 1 compliant i m also pleased to share i ll be joining with the vermont nea to launch a see something say something public service campaign and we ll invite the media to join us in this important cause to further protect our kids we can direct 1 3 million of this year s surplus to lead testing in every school in my first budget address i talked about the most undeserving victims of our opioid crisis the children born to addiction that day two years ago i vowed we would not fail them this budget continues to support our investments in prevention treatment recovery and enforcement and with an increased investment of 2 million to the family services division we can give these children more of the support hope and opportunity they deserve we all know the serious and harmful impact of our opioid crisis and with your help we ll continue to address it today i d like to address another threat to public health between 2017 and 2018 1 5 million more kids began using e cigarettes and vape products across the nation this is the biggest one year spike of any substance in nearly 50 years right here in vermont use among young people nearly doubled and the surgeon general has declared this an epidemic after all the progress made to lower nicotine addiction this is not only concerning it s frustrating i think you all know it s not my first instinct to add a tax but with a growing health risk for our kids i m proposing to levy the same tax as we do on tobacco products let s learn from the past let s not make the same mistakes with e cigarettes or anything else our kids must know the dangers of these behaviors and we should stop it in its tracks two weeks ago i asked you to consider the power of transforming the good education system we have now to the very best in the country combined with our quality of life good jobs and working to make vermont more affordable this could be the most effective economic development tool we could ever ask for it s an alignment of assets and priorities to accomplish what most of us have told our constituents we would do give every family in every community the chance to succeed and prosper it would also enhance our brand unfortunately marketing our state as the safe healthy and beautiful place we are isn t enough anymore if it was we d be seeing our labor force and communities growing instead of shrinking we have to distinguish ourselves and what better way than as the state with the best education in america think about how powerful this will be really think about it imagine what it would mean for our kids our communities and our state imagine what it would mean for our economy and imagine what it would mean for the ability of future generations to solve problems and help people but we must do more than imagine it we must have the courage to make real change together as our demographics demonstrate we can t afford to do things the way we ve always done them not if we want to maintain services revitalize every county and invest more in our priorities we must continue our work to transform our system so let s keep moving forward i know you have thoughts on how to do this as well but to get the conversation started here are some ideas to consider first i propose we invest an additional 7 million into our child care system to make it more accessible and affordable for low income and working families if you ll work with me to modernize our tax system in response to the supreme court s wayfair decision we can improve compliance and fund these investments in child care without raising property taxes to help more people pursue education and training opportunities outside the traditional college track and earn credentials too my budget increases funding for vsac s non degree grant program by over 1 million last year we committed 400 000 from the capital bill for programs and equipment to increase training opportunities for adults looking for new skills it s been successful so let s do it again this year and we ll continue to increase our support for higher education so my budget proposes 700 000 for uvm to replace declining medicaid revenue and 3 2 million more to vermont state colleges with this funding the state colleges will stop a planned three percent tuition increase on vermonters for this coming school year it will also support the creation of an associate degree program delivered in at least three tech centers throughout the state where students earn the first year of their degree as a high school senior and the second as a vermont state college student if we keep the focus on our kids and the good we can do for them we can continue to strengthen our system giving every kid the best possible education and the tools to reach their full potential from cradle to career to help revitalize all areas of our state let s modernize regulation to support growth in our local economic centers expand broadband access and take action on climate change to strengthen our environment and economy last term we agreed on the need to evaluate act 250 these regulations were put in place when we were growing too fast over time they ve become complex and in some cases redundant with other regulations today with many areas not growing at all we have an opportunity and a necessity to do better we can enhance our high environmental standards and breathe new life into our downtowns and village centers specifically let s give communities the opportunity to raise the bar when it comes to planning and environmental protection and when they meet these new standards let s reward them and encourage growth by exempting them from act 250 adding even more balance let s help them expand protections for natural areas and give our rural economy a fighting chance given that chance they ll make it because there are few more resilient than our farmers and loggers let s create flexibility for our forestry businesses working lands and trail networks let s simplify construction approval in rural industrial parks and reduce their fees let s help farms create new revenue from tourism and onsite businesses let s get the most mileage from our transportation dollars by exempting projects that have environmental protections already built in and if other state permits provide the very same protections let s not force applicants to jump through the same hoop twice these are my ideas i know you have others and i look forward to working with you but here s the bottom line we need to modernize act 250 i believe it s essential to expanding our economy and restoring the health of our smaller communities we must also continue to strengthen broadband in our state currently 75 percent of the state has high speed broadband or better there is clearly work to do to make this essential tool available to more homes and businesses and we have to acknowledge it s not just about access we need to increase speeds many communities are trying to expand infrastructure while there are grants and loans they don t always fit with local plans or budgets to help and to support our focus on the rural economy i m proposing to make bonding available for municipal broadband in areas that need it to expand service i m proposing to invest 1 million for connectivity and let s eliminate the sunset on 248 a it s worked to speed up telecom projects and we must continue to make progress my team has been working closely on a partnership with microsoft to expand broadband access and computer science education to communities with the greatest needs this partnership will come with an investment in vermont to support expanding broadband and to help kids and families in our communities learn more of the digital skills they need making these opportunities equitable and accessible for all is a goal we share and i believe these initiatives move us in the right direction we can also have a stronger economy by building a cleaner economy transitioning to electric vehicles can save millions of dollars in 2015 approximately 830 million was spent on gasoline sales in vermont if this travel had all been powered by electricity the cost would ve been significantly less saving drivers more than 500 million plus our comprehensive energy plan recognizes more electric vehicles are essential to meeting our climate and energy goals we need 10 percent about 50 000 of the cars and trucks on our roads to be electric by 2025 and 25 percent by 2030 i don t believe we can meet those goals unless we help people make this transition today we only have about 1 000 evs on the road less than one percent of new passenger vehicle registrations we all know transportation costs are high for rural vermonters that s one of the reasons i will not support a carbon tax but in its final report the vermont climate action commission recommends an incentive to make electric vehicles more affordable which i believe is a better approach because as we ve seen incentives work so i m proposing 1 5 million in rebates to help more people purchase or lease new or used evs and to lead by example i m asking for your support in using 500 000 to invest in more evs and ev infrastructure for the state fleet this is another great area of balance because meeting these targets isn t just about making our state cleaner and healthier it s also about growing the economy i view clean water the same way the environmental benefits are obvious what might be less obvious is that it s also an investment in growing our economy and creating jobs in just the last two years we ve invested more than 100 million in clean water projects improved 15 000 acres of agricultural lands and conserved or restored more than 1 500 acres of river corridors floodplains and wetlands it s not an exaggeration to say that the 20 year 2 billion project ahead of us is as much a major infrastructure program as it is essential environmental policy that s why my budget fully funds the clean water board s recommendation this includes about 15 million for the state s clean water fund over 12 million in capital funds and 1 million in transportation dollars combined with over 19 million in federal funds all told this budget dedicates nearly 48 million to clean water projects i want to thank treasurer pearce for her continued leadership in this area her bridge plan for fy18 and fy19 and the legislature s input and support have set us on the right track and for what is one of the worst kept secrets in montpelier our clean water proposal includes dedicating 8 million in ongoing revenue from the estate tax to the clean water fund now before either side of the aisle jumps to conclusions i hope you ll listen to the details because it s a packaged concept first the estate tax is a stable source average revenue since 2004 has been about 19 5 million and the lowest year was 2015 at 9 9 million using a portion of this revenue for long term investments makes a lot of sense and what this budget shows is that we can fund the clean water plan with existing resources what we ve also found in this research is that by reforming this policy we can better sustain the revenue and the fiscal health of our state tax professionals consistently tell me that because we are so far out of line with other states the estate tax is a factor in retirees leaving as part of this plan i propose increasing the current exemption from 2 75 million to 5 75 million over four years this will align us with maine and new york and more closely with the federal exemption here s why this is important currently we re one of only 12 states that have this tax at all and the recent doubling of the federal exemption to over 11 million makes our exclusion radically out of step vermonters impacted by this tax are well advised from tax professionals and they are highly mobile if we can come together this change will help keep more of these taxpayers here and support a legacy of clean healthy lakes rivers and streams all at the same time this is just one example of reforms we can make and policies we can implement to help us keep more people and more revenue here last year we worked together to make sure that low and middle income vermonters weren t taxed on their social security helping retirees live a little more comfortably after spending their lives in the workforce and this year we can help another deserving group our veterans have served their country put others ahead of themselves and in many cases placed their lives on the line for our nation and the values and principles we hold dear only seven states including us fully tax military retirement benefits before we leave this spring let s reduce that to six and eliminate it completely by the time we adjourn next year it s the least we can do another area where we ve agreed is the need for more housing that s affordable i m sure you hear it as much as i do from young families trying to find that first affordable home seniors looking to downsize and even employers trying to recruit workers across the state there are abandoned vacant and blighted properties which are currently driving down property values but have the potential to unlock needed stock so let s eliminate the land gains tax this was implemented in the 70s to halt rapid development and housing speculation but that was before most communities adopted land use regulations before act 250 was fully implemented and before we faced a demographic crisis currently when a property owner sells within six years of purchase they may pay a substantial penalty eliminating this tax will reduce a major barrier to investment in our neighborhoods create more capacity and increase grand lists as low value properties are restored to their full potential next let s make sure these updated properties are efficient eighty percent of our housing stock is at least 40 years old and nearly half of that is 80 years old we know the cost to heat these older homes can push them out of reach for some so my budget includes 1 million to restore these units if weatherization is part of the project finally so many of the neighborhoods affected by these issues are in and around our downtowns we also know young families and workers want to be close to jobs services and restaurants social and community events so let s continue to make these areas attractive places to put down roots by increasing the downtown and historic tax credit to 2 6 million each of these initiatives will encourage upgrades to homes that already exist in the places we want to see grow attracting and retaining more workers is also a key goal of the paid family leave plan i put forward last week with governor chris sununu our proposal would provide universally accessible and competitively priced plans for all employers and employees in both states now i know that some of you want to go all the way to a government run program funded by an increase in the payroll tax let me address that by first saying if you give my plan a fair shot you might see there are advantages to taking the step i m proposing first we can launch more quickly more affordably and more reliably than if the state had to create the program from scratch second it ensures we aren t placing the burden of startup costs or the risk of underfunding and insolvency on taxpayers and third we re not mandating another cost on our employers and employees for an expense they may not be able to afford i understand your concerns that a voluntary approach might not have a big enough pool to sustain a program that s why our proposal places all eligible state employees from both states into the plan creating a large and diverse pool overnight and my budget includes funding to offer this coverage to our state employees if we move forward with a voluntary plan we can deliver a workable and scalable program that s administered efficiently reduces risk to taxpayers and state government and balances the value of paid family leave with our ability to pay let s show vermonters we can work together to reach a goal we agree on even if we have different ideas on how to get there in every corner of our state there are communities businesses and non profits large and small ready to grow but good jobs go unfilled because we need more working age people that should alarm each of us in this room but we can work together to change it we can change it by creating the greatest cradle to career education system in the nation we can change it by investing in housing downtowns and our environment to make vermont an affordable and attractive place to live and we can change it by reaching potential vermonters and showing them a clear path to move to our state i m pleased we moved forward on some smaller initiatives last year like your remote worker program returnships and the stay to stay pilot all focused on growing our workforce each of these incremental steps has helped but we must do more this year my budget includes a total of 2 5 million to identify those most likely to consider moving to vermont tell them our story and make it easier for them to get here it starts with data driven marketing to identify and reach those interested in what vermont has to offer it includes funding for relocation support to really sell vermont by helping those who want to move here find a great job housing and a community they re drawn to in the regions and job sectors that need them most from the overwhelming interest in the remote worker initiative you proposed last year again we saw incentives work so let s build on that success and invest more this year to relocate new workers for jobs with vermont businesses the fact is every new worker we recruit to live here allows a business a community a school and tax revenue to grow we cannot lose sight of this fact if we want to fund more early education or science and technology for kids we need more taxpayers not more taxes better roads and bridges more taxpayers more drug prevention and treatment more taxpayers each new taxpayer provides a bit of relief to someone who s already here and allows us to continue funding programs and services that vermonters need and value this has to be our focus and we must act now we all know our challenges are great but i believe in the strength of this institution i believe in each of you and our ability to solve problems and help people at a time when it s so easy to focus on the bad let s believe in the good the good that comes from the people of vermont and the good that can come from this building i know i do i ve seen it and it s what keeps me coming back after nearly twenty years our success our ability to achieve real results relies on the way we choose to engage each other how we choose to treat each other and the issues we choose to address we have an opportunity to follow the example of those who came before us who confronted the challenges of their time who faced adversity with the courage to do what was right over what was easy and when the world seemed as though it was coming apart had the wisdom to bring us together today we can be the example we can reject hate and anger partisanship and division we can recognize vermonters call for balance for civility and for us to work together and we can commit to solving the problems ahead of us and helping the people who sent us here to do so if we do we will make a difference in the lives of vermonters and our actions will prove that the best work still comes when we re guided by our core beliefs in freedom and unity

joining us for the fourth quarter 2018 earnings call the earnings were outstanding an outstanding way to close an important but very challenging year i am very grateful to all of our southwest people they are extraordinary and they really showed their resilience and their fortitude they did an exceptional job and they have set us up very very well for what ought to be a banner and a record year in 2019 our celebration is bittersweet this is the first earnings report in the history of southwest airlines without our beloved herb kelleher it is a huge loss for us it s a huge loss of course for herb s family and really the countless friends and acquaintances around the world that he touched in some way our world owes him a huge debt of gratitude for how radically better he made it and without a doubt we are more inspired at southwest than ever to keep our company strong and keep it growing and to make herb proud so everybody look out despite the 2018 challenges we set a number of financial records i ll just underscore the cash record cash flow tammy i think we had record cash on hand to end the year record low balance sheet leverage and all that despite almost 7 higher jet fuel prices and tammy and tom and mike are going to give you all a thorough recap of 2018 so i won t go on any further other than to repeat it was a strong year and a superb finish i want to talk about 2019 i ll talk about the government shutdown in a minute we have a stellar year planned as i told you all in october our revenue outlook remains superb for the year we re off to a great start in january have industry leading forecast i think for first quarter of solid capacity growth and barring anything unforeseen we project unit revenue growth for the year in excess of 3 just like we said back in october we ve got strong traffic strong yields supported by significantly enhanced revenue management capabilities that were rolled out during 2018 we ve got new revenue enhancements committed and under construction as we previously promised and expected to come online in 2020 stay tuned for more details later on this year and no i am not talking about charging for bags based on our current fuel prices our unit cost outlook for the year is also quite good it s under 2 we have a terrific 70 fuel hedge built for 2019 at a reasonable cost with zero foot exposure and dramatic protection at say 100 a barrel we ll have protection below that as well but it is very dramatic at that level our cost outlook ex fuel and items for the year is in the 3 to 3 5 range if we missed that range it will be because we re below it and the only caveat in the unforeseen category here is that we do need to hit our capacity target because the denominator is important when it comes to unit cost as we said in the release the casm ex is front half loaded for a couple of reasons tammy will go over those the second half is flattish that bodes well as we get into 2020 and really a good comp to what was a stellar cost performance in 2018 i ll quote my good friend herb kelleher on the first half next year in terms of cost which is it s an aberration it s an anomaly bordering on an aberration so regarding our warning back in october about cost it s obviously uncharacteristic for us our early indications were simply coming in much higher than we had been previously expecting we shared that and thanks to our leaders for doing a great job at arriving at a sensible budget for 2019 and on committing to a series of initiatives that will drive further efficiencies of course southwest is famous for being a low cost efficient airline over a long period of time we ve been able to control our cost ex fuel to 1 to 2 unit growth per annum and that s largely been driven by wage and benefits inflation that everyone here is familiar with i don t expect that to change going forward except to say that it is our goal to control inflation to less than 1 to 2 per annum it s important for a number of reasons that we strive for that but in any event the suggestions by some that our costs are not they re out of control are absolutely false we made controlling our cost our no 1 priority for 2019 and also for the next several years but i do want to add quickly that we ll also expect to improve our operational performance and our customer service deliveries so we don t want to move backwards with those categories over the past 15 years we ve seen a remarkable improvement in our revenue generating capabilities along with a dramatic improvement in our fuel consumption efficiency over the last five years we ve seen the best returns on invested capital in our history and it obviously validates that our investments have more than paid off so bottom line 2019 is shaped up as a phenomenal year so last part the government shutdown i ll sum it up in a word it is maddening and i will also state the obvious here which is that no one can predict what impact it will have if it continues so all of the bullish comments that i just shared assume that current trends continue or we at least or we abate some of the penalties that we re already incurring but everyone needs to be on notice and on guard that this shutdown could harm the economy and it could harm air travel what i can tell you is that we will do everything that we can to find a way to work through this slop and contain the damage and keep our finances strong so with that quick overview let me turn it over to mr tom nealon tom nealon president ok very good thank you gary thank you everyone for joining us well i got to tell you we had as you just heard from gary we had a very very strong fourth quarter you ll hear from tammy in just a few moments our cost performance was very strong we beat our guidance and our revenue performance was also very strong and we came in at the very upper end of our guidance and i dare to say that the entire southwest family and by the way we are a family it is a family you all made it happen i m very thankful to each one of you and i appreciate all the hard work that you put in every day so we are in fact seeing fourth quarter yield momentum continue into the first quarter and we also continue to see solid passenger demand throughout the booking curve i think that barring any major changes in the macro environments or a protracted continuation of a government shutdown as gary alluded to we are set up very well for a strong first quarter and first half rasm performance as i said in october call q4 was a clean quarter in terms of year over year comps we had record operating revenues of 5 7 billion which is up 8 5 year over year and this was driven by strong performances in both passenger revenues and other revenues our load factor was down one and a half points year over year which was pretty much right in line with our expectations while our passenger yields increased 3 7 for the quarter and we saw stable trends across the booking curve including close in corporate business strength as well as strength and solid holiday performance our average one way fares were up 6 3 for the quarter and our performance was consistent across all of our regions and our yield strength produced a healthy fourth quarter rasm it was up 1 8 year over year which again was due to the upper end of our guidance range of plus 1 and 2 and this is consistent with the original guidance we gave in october and reaffirmed again in december i think it s also worth noting that keep in mind this rasm performance was on a 6 5 increase in capacity and we also overlapped a plus 2 comp in 2017 so i think that s pretty strong performance our scheduled operating day was down 2 year over year in q4 as we continued eliminating very early and very late shoulder flying which by the way is also consistent with what we described in our prior calls just reducing our shoulder flying our new res system capabilities contributed roughly 95 million in ebit benefit in the quarter which was above the higher end of our guidance range of 80 million to 90 million and this contributed a nice way to our yield performance for the quarter so that puts the res system benefits at 205 million of ebit for 2018 which is a bit ahead of our plan and we are very pleased with the performance and the capabilities of the new system we re pleased with how our revenue analysts have adopted it and really embraced it we ll continue to enhance this and leverage it fully going forward as well as we mentioned in our earnings release we will be ending service to mexico city later in the quarter but i have to say that overall we are really pleased with our international business although our near and national markets are a small percent about 4 of our capacity they were in fact accretive to our q4 rasm results our international rasm outpaced domestic rasm and that was on almost 8 increase in capacity and these markets are continuing to develop very nicely very much in sync with our plan the international load factors by the way were also up year over year and we saw a pretty nice improvement in the performance over mexico beach destinations in the quarter having said all that we don t have any plans to add any additional international this year mainly due to the fact that hawaii is our top new market but the rasm performance of our international markets is very strong and we re very pleased our boarding and ancillary products also performed well both were up double digits year over year and as you might recall in late q3 we introduced variable pricing for our earlybird product and this is performing right in line if not slightly ahead of our expectations business partner revenues were again strong in q4 and our rapid rewards program continues to be a strong performer as our cobranded credit card revenue again grew double digits year over year in the quarter and we saw real strength across all metrics in the rapid rewards program and this by the way is at already strong base so we re seeing strong acquisitions in new rapid reward numbers new credit card acquisitions that outpace passenger growth and we re also seeing strong spending on the card and very high retention rates so this is a very healthy program so our industry leading program rapid rewards continues to perform extremely well and there is still a lot of runway in front of us for continued growth so let me now shift to the first quarter so based on our current bookings and yield trends we do expect q1 rasm to increase as you ve already heard in the range of 4 to 5 year over year we are seeing a step up in our year over year rasm trend and this is largely due to strength in our base business trends including strength in close in bookings strength in corporate travel and as i said just a moment ago strong performance from rapid rewards but in addition to these factors there are several things i do just want to mention real quickly first in the holiday calendar fronts we will be shifting as you know easter from q1 to q2 and this is about a 40 million revenue shift it is a shift second keep in mind that we didn t have any benefit in q1 last year for our new reservation system as you recall this didn t begin to roll out until q2 last year the bottom line is we are expecting a year over year rasm benefit in the first quarter of about one and a half points that s pretty solid third we had a one and a half point rasm headwind last year in the first quarter and this was really driven by several things first the suboptimal flight schedule which we are interested in being done talking about the competitive fair environments and the spring break calendar shift so none of those things repeat this year and we see those as a one and a half point tailwind in q1 this year as you know we also implemented a systemwide fare increase in late november which we expect to be a benefit throughout 2019 so i do want you to keep in mind our schedule is now optimized our fleet is at full strength and growing we now have strong revenue management capabilities that we did not have before and we are better prepared to compete in an environment than we were a year ago and finally just like everyone we are keeping a very close eye on the impact of the government shutdown and we currently estimated 10 million to 15 million negative impact in january revenues thus far and that is built into our q1 rasm guidance i do think it s important to keep in mind though that a relatively small piece of our business travel is tied to government contracts so our exposure is relatively low compared to others perhaps but it s still meaningful and we re keeping a very close eye on this i do want to turn to the second quarter for just a moment we are expecting a healthy year over year rasm performance here as well and that s based on the current trends as well as on the prior year headwinds that we experienced and as a reminder we had three point rasm headwind in q2 last year and two things really drove this first was that suboptimal schedule again that was 1 point and second we had a two point impact following flight 1380 both those issues are behind us and we see this as a three point rasm tailwind for q2 and we should also see a year over year rasm benefit in the second quarter from our res system enhancements so to wrap it up we are very pleased with the revenue trends we re seeing as we start 2019 and our goal is very clear we will grow rasm this year in excess of 3 and we are off to a great start here in the first quarter so with that i ll turn it over to mr van de ven michael michael van de ven chief operating officer thanks tom we finished the year with a 79 2 dot on time performance and that was lower than what we planned for but still it was a one point two point improvement over 2017 but more importantly our performance relative to the industry really showed improvement over the last half of the year we were 6th and 7th in the industry with respect to our on time performance in the first and second quarters but we improved at the fourth place there in the third and fourth quarters and now if you exclude hawaii out of there of course we would have been third the majority of that improvement was the addition of a tool that allows us that allows for our on time performance to be an optimization criteria in the schedule design and that added about a point of ott rep in the second half of the year and we did that without having to add any significant additional operational investments in our block and turn times and in fact if you had looked at southwest on a gauge adjusted basis we have less block and turn time invested on an on time performance point than anyone else in the industry so being near the top of the industry in terms of performance while maintaining a really good asset productivity is a very cost effective way for us to fund our reliability targets turning to bag handling for a second we put over 123 million bags on airplanes in 2018 and we delivered 97 1 of them on the flights as they were tagged last year that number rounded to 97 2 so very consistent bag handling performance in 17 and 18 and those are the best two years performances in our history we re doing all of that with pencil and paper as our primary tracking and processing tools so in 2019 we re investing in scanning and subsequent automation that will be the building blocks not only improve bag handling but also improve the efficiency of our flight close procedures and that again is going to give us an on time performance lift without any additional block or turn time investments we continue to focus on hospitality efforts in 2018 and we pushed a lot of supplemental customer information to our stations so that they can go out and identify customers that we want to recognize or perhaps apologize for a previous bad experience we hosted several hospitality summits for our people throughout the year and those things are certainly making a difference because our complaints to the dot are down 25 from where they were last year and we had the lowest complaint ratio in the industry last year turning to etops just for a second our primary operational focus in the near term is getting that etops authorization all that we have left are tabletop and validation flights that demonstrate our ability to execute a long range navigation and our extended operational procedures but until the government shutdown ends we are at a total standstill now you may have heard that there had been additional faa personnel authorized to return to work but the work that they can do is limited to safety specific activity and certification of new or expanded operational capabilities it doesn t fall within that definition and thus the standstill if the shutdown ends within a week i think we have a reasonable chance of beginning service in the first quarter of 2019 otherwise it will likely be in the second quarter in turning to 2019 a little bit further we do have several other initiatives and technology efforts focused on enabling productivity enhancements we plan to implement a new maintenance system either late in 2019 or possibly early in 2020 and it s going to provide substantial opportunities to streamline our processes and eliminate some inefficient overhead costs we have associated with our current system we re planning to make investments in our crew systems better connectivity with our crews along with some improved decision support technologies to recover from our regular operations and we also have more opportunities to continue to incorporate some of the more advanced predictive analytics in the noc and to use that while we re running our daily operations so just to close out i think our operations are on very solid footing as we move into 2019 the operational metrics are right where they need to be and that gives us more time to focus on the cost opportunities that gary and tom have mentioned and with that brief update i will turn it over to ms romo tammy romo executive vice president and chief financial officer all right thank you mike and hello everyone i m also very pleased with how our people closed out the year strong and fourth quarter our 2018 performance truly was a second half story our people s warrior spirit was on full display as they overcame great challenges last year to produce the outstanding results we reported this morning and we have great momentum coming into this year on top of the record fourth quarter revenue performance tom took you through we had a solid fourth quarter and full year cost performance despite higher year over year fuel prices we did see some relief in crude prices in the back half of december which resulted in our fourth quarter hedge fuel price of 2 25 per gallon coming in at the lower end of our mid december guidance range the lower market prices in december also provided an opportunity for us to add to our first half 2019 fuel hedge position as well as 2020 with the brent crude spot price trading in the low 50 per barrel range we are now 70 hedged for this year with 75 to 85 protection in first half 2019 and a roughly 60 hedge in the second half of the year for 2020 we are now roughly 50 hedged our hedging premiums for this year are approximately 95 million or about 0 04 per gallon compared with 2018 premium expense of 135 million or 0 06 a gallon our 2019 hedging protection produces modest gains at current market prices and kicks in more materially at 70 brent crude equivalent so we re well prepared should we continue to see volatility in prices and as we previously mentioned our 2019 hedges are a mix of wti and brent crude oil and are structured so that we fully participate in a market price decline our first quarter 2019 based on market prices last friday and given our hedging positions we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the 2 to 2 05 range with an estimated 0 02 hedging gain offset by 0 06 of premium costs and for full year 2019 we expect our fuel price per gallon to be the 2 to 2 10 range with an estimated 0 01 hedging gain offset by 0 04 of premium cost fuel efficiency improved to 1 5 in 2018 and we expect a similar improvement year over year in first quarter and for the full year 2019 in the 1 to 2 range which is around 60 million in annual fuel savings this will continue to be a key part of our cost story going forward which should become more meaningful as we begin retiring 700 this year and continue taking on more fuel efficient max aircraft excluding fuel special items and profit sharing our fourth quarter unit costs were down slightly compared to last year and slightly better than our expectation and flat to up 1 as a reminder fourth quarter 2018 unit cost benefited from a year over year tailwind of about three points due to fourth quarter 2017 s employee tax reform bonus for full year 2018 our casm excluding fuel special items and profit sharing ended right in line with our expectations of flat to up 1 year over year our unwavering focus on controlling costs played a significant role in managing cost inflation throughout the year and i d like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous effort and i d also like to thank our team for all the hard work they ve put into completing our 2019 plan we currently expect our full year 2019 casm excluding fuel and profit sharing to increase in the 3 to 3 5 range year over year with the pressure weighted to the first half of this year for first quarter 2019 we re expecting our unit cost excluding fuel and profit sharing to increase around 6 year over year and our second quarter 2019 year over year casm ex trend is expected to be similar to first quarter for the second half of this year current cost trends and expectations were just flat year over year unit cost excluding fuel and profit sharing our quarterly capacity growth is playing a big part in our first half cost pressure and as you all know the timing of our hawaii flying has been delayed in this influx and we re incurring hawaii specific start up cost without the benefit of the flying which alone is about a half point penalty in our first half casm ex year over year trend in addition we expect first half unit cost pressure from the underutilization of our fleet due to the timing of hawaii this cost pressure should ease as we ramp up our hawaii flying in the second half of this year and this was all contemplated in our full year capacity gross guidance of no more than 5 with respect to our first quarter casm ex year over year inflation as we mentioned in this morning s press release the largest drivers of our 6 year over year casm growth are the underutilization of our fleet and due in the first half of the year due to the delay in hawaii flying in addition to higher airport cost and appreciation and the timing of maintenance and technology spend as we said on our last call controlling our cost is a top priority and as we always have we ll continue our rigorous efforts to contain costs and protect our competitive advantage our long term goal is to contain annual year over year growth in our unit cost excluding fuel and profit sharing to below 2 which i believe is reasonable and achievable and finally as a wrap up of our cost discussion the primary reason on our tax rate for fourth quarter came in closer to 20 as the realization of year end tax credit we continue to estimate our 2019 tax rate to be approximately 23 5 and on that note the lower tax rate certainly was a welcome contributor to our record operating and free cash flow performance in 2018 we ended the year with ample cash and short term investments of 3 7 billion with our 1 billion revolver fully available our balance sheet remains strong and have very manageable debt obligations and capital spending plans for 2019 since 2018 we invested approximately 1 9 billion into the business which ended lower than our guidance of 2 billion but mostly due to timing in 2019 we continue to expect a similar level of capex spending in the 1 9 billion to 2 billion range as we invest in the future of our airline we are investing in technology including a new maintenance system which is as significant to the operations side of our business as our new reservation system into the commercial side and we have airport investments under way particularly at lax and st louis and we re building a new maintenance hangar in baltimore and of course we have 44 aircraft deliveries this year including 28 new aircraft in boeing which i ll cover shortly we expect our investments to help drive incremental revenue opportunities as well as support longer term cost adjustments as we roll out better tools for employees and more efficient processes and technologies to drive productivity as well as support our long term growth plan our 2018 free cash flow was a record 3 1 billion and we returned 2 3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for 2019 we plan to continue our balanced approach to investing in the business and in our employees and with the opportunities to continue providing our free cash flow to our shareholders before i close i ll quickly take you through our fleet and capacity plans we ended 2018 with 750 aircraft in our fleet in line with our target and for 2019 we currently have a total of 44 aircraft deliveries which is comprised of seven owned max 7 21 owned max 8s and 16 leased max 8s this is 10 more than our previous order book disclosure as we had one december max 8s delivery that split into 2019 and we also had nine additional leased max 8 aircraft these additional nine leased aircraft are earmarked for this year s fleet replacement needs as we mentioned we ll start retiring some of our oldest 700 this year as we continue with our fleet modernization efforts which will help improve our fuel deficiency operational reliability and maintenance burden our current plan is to retire around 20 of our 700 this year resulting in about 25 net aircraft additions for 2019 and a year end 2019 fleet of approximately 775 aircraft we expect first quarter 2019 capacity to increase in the 3 5 to 4 range year over year and for our full year 2019 we continue to expect our available seat miles to increase no more than 5 year over year our schedule is currently published through early august and this schedule excludes expected hawaii flying which as we covered will be added as soon as we can here in a week or so we ll publish our schedules through the end of september excluding hawaii our first half 2019 capacity growth is 2 5 and as a reminder hawaii is expected to represent up to half of planned 2019 capacity growth and we re certainly looking forward to providing more capacity details once we re able to finalize our hawaii schedules in the meantime with our etops process on hold we have some uncertainty in our capacity plans for this year so we will take it one schedule at a time for now so in closing despite our challenges in 2018 our employees rose to the occasion time and time again and i thought our execution was very strong as a quick recap on what we shared today as tom mentioned we are starting 2019 with a very healthy rasm outlook we remain committed to our low fare brand and our revenue management capabilities are as strong as ever we have been very focused on closing out our 2019 plan over the past few months and despite some cost inflation above where we like to be this year i feel really good about our 2019 cost plans and our path to arrest this trajectory going forward in particular the much improved cost outlook for second half 2019 first and foremost we want to expand our margins in 2019 and we want to improve our returns on capital while fuel prices are currently down year over year our improved fuel hedging position for 2019 and 2020 provides even more near term protection if oil prices go back up we continue to invest in the business in our fleet facilities and technologies and many of our investments this year will support future growth and scalability at southwest airlines as we continue our march to become the world s most loved most flown and most profitable airline in closing i want to personally thank those of you who reached out to herb reached out to us to share your personal stories and heartfelt thoughts about herb to our southwest family he really did change the airline industry for the best and though will be missed greatly his legacy will live on us forever and with that greg i ll turn it back to you now to take questions questions and answers operator we ll now begin our first question from joseph denardi with stifel joseph denardi stifel financial corp analyst hey good afternoon everybody thanks for the time gary i think there was some urgency from you last quarter regarding the cost pressure you were seeing and the need to find more revenue to offset that i think you mentioned that you were open to alternatives i mean has that mindset changed because you re now more comfortable with 19 casm ex and then 2020 returning to more normal levels can you just maybe update your perspective there garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes sure joe to be honest with you i don t remember exactly the words that i used but i wouldn t say that anything has changed other than time has gone by we formed up our plan we more than sustained our momentum it s actually improved and we ve told you the truth in october and we re telling you the truth today we are very excited about 2019 i think what i must admit was just the desire that we have to keep the pipeline full of new ideas and new initiatives and in terms of what we have in flight right now i think we re all very pleased very encouraged with the changes that we made during 2018 we ve got plenty of experience under our belt there and again my hat s off to our commercial team i think they did a phenomenal job so we feel really good about that and even better about our forecast for 2019 and the benefits that would flow from that beyond that i think i was clear in october that we weren t contemplating then nor are we contemplating now any new initiatives per se on the revenue front for 2019 all i was doing today is just to reiterate that as far as 2020 goes and what i first mentioned in july that work is more than an idea it s a commitment the construction is under way every time that we have relooked at the couple of ideas that we have under construction they look better to us so i don t think there s anything different in the message today other than we have better visibility more certainty and we re down the road with some of our work it s been firmed up we ve got a project planned people working on it and we re feeling very good about 2019 and encouraged about our opportunity to continue to augment that momentum in 2020 joseph denardi stifel financial corp analyst that s helpful gary just two very quick follow ups i mean so should i understand that in terms of the ancillary or the revenue initiatives in 2020 that we should just wait to hear what you re planning on doing at this point you re not ready to talk about it and then the second one is you mentioned the fare increase in november as a driver of prasm can you just quantify that somehow so we can understand how impactful things like that are for your rasm like what it s adding to first quarter or beyond that garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer joe i ll let tammy address the latter question on the first part of your question yes it s very straightforward all we want people to know is that we re not sitting by and assuming that revenues will come to us that we re continually looking for new ideas or it s a little early for competitive reasons to share exactly what we want to do and so yes you re going to have to stay tuned on that for some time later in the year when it s more ready for prime time that will give us better opportunity to forecast better what we think the benefits will be but tammy you want to talk about the fare increase component tammy romo executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i d be happy to do that and as you all know when you re assuming what you re assuming for revenue obviously depends on your assumptions in terms of the impact to traffic but kind of all else equal and assuming no dilution in traffic it can be up to us say call it 1 but all that s been baked into the guidance that we provided you this morning joseph denardi stifel financial corp analyst that s helpful thank you very much operator and moving on from barclays we have brandon oglenski brandon oglenski barclays analyst good afternoon everyone thanks for taking my question i guess gary or tom i mean the revenue outlook here especially in the first half sounds pretty strong i guess can you talk strategically as jetblue rolls out their version of basic economy and the majority of the industry goes to this ancillary based pricing structure is that strategically what s driving you guys to change some of these initiatives that we have to wait to hear about in 2020 and is it making it more difficult on the forward end of the booking curve to effectively generate the same rasm as your competitors garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer great question tom will take a swing at it too i think the short answer is no that s not what we are responding to what we are our capabilities evolve over time hopefully that means they improve and we see opportunities where we can drive business in greater volumes or more efficiently in terms of the pricing and that s what we re going after here in the near term i was asked i m asked all the time about basic economy you re not going to see basic economy from southwest that s not what we do and i already said we re not going to charge for bag fees we have we think better opportunities that fit our brand i love the fact that we re different and they un bundle and we don t and so we just need to continue to find ways with the universe of travelers and the varying needs that they have to see how we can stay true to our brand and offer something of more value to road warriors to once a year flyers whatever it might be and i d say we have a long list of ideas and right now we re going to focus on a couple and they re going to come to market in 2020 tom tom nealon president what i think i ll add to that gary is when you think about over time there are some things that we would probably have done sooner if we were able to fire reservation system the old saas cowboys system just preclude us from doing things that we would liked to have done years ago now we have the foundation of the one res system in it really does set the foundation for us to do some things that honestly when we talk with you later in the year you re going to think that makes perfect sense i would ve expected you to have done that earlier well we would have if we could have now we can so we will so that s the kind of thing you re going to hear us really talking about but in our ancillary business if you look at our other earlybird product and things like that these are not inconsequential and by thinking of what s the variable pricing that kind of thing we really do continue to drive strong ancillary performance so i m really proud of the product and where we are and there s capability now that we have that we can build upon so i guess i ll stop with stay tuned for the investor day that tammy will talk about at some point but that s where it s at garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer and just very quickly on your point about staying competitive if you look at the results i mean there s no evidence that we are not competitive in fact there s evidence that we have the best combination of revenues and cost and returns period so i think we re all very confident about where we stand in our brand and we ll put it up against anybody brandon oglenski barclays analyst there s no doubt gary your returns and margins are pretty much leading but i guess are we to think then that on the forward booking curve where you are facing competition from the ulcc models you guys are able to get away with a higher fare structure is that true or garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer well our ulcc overlap is gigantic so i think that the results would say yes and i m just pointing back to earlier comments that i made about our enhanced revenue management capabilities so we re in a better position than ever to compete with low cost high cost you name it and tom has hinted that we are going to use we re leveraging this technology to pursue a couple of new revenue generating ideas so we have a lot of strengths we have more seats in the united states than anybody else we have more customers than anybody else we have the best frequent flyer program we have a great overall product in terms of the reliability in the on time performance in the baggage handling we have the best employees in terms of the hospitality it is a dynamite package nobody can approach matching that combination of strengths certainly the ulccs can t come close to that and again as i ll say we re real confident about where we are we never want to stand still and we want to keep investing and making improvements operator the next question will come from david vernon with bernstein david vernon sanford c bernstein analyst good afternoon and thanks for taking the time i want to ask a little bit about the decision to kind of postpone any international growth this year if you kind of look back the last couple of years opening up international was kind of a growth avenue for you and i wanted to get a sense for whether this is just the decision to kind of prioritize the organizational focus on hawaii or whether maybe the opportunities for where you could get to in international markets are maybe getting more developed quicker than you thought i m just trying to get a sense for how you re feeling about the potential still in international given that you re taking a pause this year garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer no it s the former and we ve been clear about that so we re going to be growing i think most people think pretty aggressively this year we ve added a lot of airplanes to overcome the retirement of the classic fleet and then grow beyond that so we ll we re at record fleet numbers this year and we ll be adding a net of 25 ish in 2019 so the to answer your question is what do we do with 25 airplanes and we re going to hawaii we re going big that needs to be the focus and it kind of crowds out expansion in other areas like international tom gave a quick summary of the international performance as we saw here in the fourth quarter and taking a little breather there right now is allowing really good unit revenue development so that s all fine but we have vast opportunities to grow internationally and were it not for hawaii we would absolutely be adding some more international routes and augmenting some of our flying so it s simply a matter of prioritization and hawaii i think deserves that kind of prioritization it s that big of an opportunity david vernon sanford c bernstein analyst and then no opportunities to maybe repurpose some of the equipment from underperforming domestic routes into maybe international if that would be a little bit more attractive like how do you guys think about making that balance just in there garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer well that s just you do that every day so yes we re pruning and in fact that will be part of our cost initiatives that we talked about back in october is evolving our route strategy so that not only is it more commercially viable but it also is more customer friendly in terms of recovery if we have late flights and that should help our cost performance so we are always doing those kinds of things we have a very complicated network there are infinite solutions as to how we route our aircraft and that is one of the inputs but yes the answer is absolutely obviously we re always doing that and we like where we are with the route system as it is right now but we ll continue to prune it as we go forward david vernon sanford c bernstein analyst and then maybe just one quick follow up on laguardia and reagan can you give us a sense for when the timing of those gates that you leased from alaska is going to kick in and whether or not the capacity that would be going into those gates is in the asm guide already garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer you re testing my memory but i believe it s in the fall in the november time period michael van de ven chief operating officer last year garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer of 2018 it s already gone in david vernon sanford c bernstein analyst those are so those gates are already being utilized garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer those flights are in place and performing well we ve also moved laguardia is undergoing this massive makeover and we moved our new facilities so that s been very serendipitous for us to get really good real estate at the same time that we re adding flights so all that s gone really well also david vernon sanford c bernstein analyst all right great thank you operator moving on from jpmorgan we have jamie baker jamie baker j p morgan analyst hey good afternoon everybody first question on hawaii and tammy sort touched on this saying that hawaii could constitute half of this year s growth but i m curious with the etops delay relative to your initial expectations is that possibly sort of working to your advantage in so far as the non etops related preparations are obviously still taking place in the background so does that imply that when you do finally start service you can ramp up more quickly than planned in other words if the cadence was originally to add and i m making this up i don t know three nonstop routes per quarter so you d be doing 12 after a year if you don t start flying until the second quarter could you still get to the year end plan in less time because of the delay that you re currently taking or does it not work that way garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer well this is probably a better question for mike isn t it so jamie are you coming at it more from an operational buildup as opposed to a commercial ramp up jamie baker j p morgan analyst well both presumably had you started service in the fourth quarter of last year if you were flying it now you d have a plan in place for the fourth quarter of this year as the date slips does the fourth quarter plan come down or can you ramp more quickly because you re basically just twiddling your thumbs at this point no offense waiting for the government to get its act together michael van de ven chief operating officer yes so jamie this is mike in terms of hawaii when you think about all the other non etops things our staff is ready our procedures are ready our gates are ready our equipment is ready we re ready to go with that the only pacing item we have with the ramp up is making sure that as we ramp up we have an adequate number of pilots trained for etops flying and so i will tell you that the slope to ramp up over the first three to six months is probably what it is and then after that we don t have as many we don t have any constraints really after that garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes and just philosophically jamie we are going to be conservative so this is there s a certification process for a reason and i think what just to underscore what mike just said we re going to want to go at a pace that we re comfortable with and i don t think we will be at the same place at the end of the year that we would have been mike had we started this february 1 in terms of flying but at the same time in the grand scheme of things we re going to get there and it s not talking about a year s delay and we our commercial folks have other purposes for relative to the earlier question there are plenty of places that we can put airplanes and that is one advantage we have as an airline we can move the airplanes around and our people are very resilient and they re willing to do temporary duty in other locations so but it s sloppy and we ve admitted that and it s reflected in our first half numbers even with that we re still looking at really a stellar year and other than that nothing s changed the nice thing is the faa has approved our program it is ready to go all we have to do now is demonstrate to them that we can execute our program and so the line of sight to getting to the certification is pretty darn sharp and the faa is really anxious to get their part of this work done too it s just a shame that we are where we are with the shutdown jamie baker j p morgan analyst sure sure that s very helpful color and i wasn t i didn t mean to insinuate that it was that southwest was to blame for the delay here and second as i m sure you re aware competitor growth in secondary cities is running quite a bit ahead of what s taking place in the major markets obviously united is driving some of that constraints at the hubs also a contributing factor but any time i think secondary cities i obviously think southwest so is it safe to assume that in terms of year over year rasm your larger markets are outperforming the secondary cities or would that be a stretch garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer well i you know us so well so i don t know that i m trying to debate the point but i think i don t think of southwest as a secondary city airline 100 of our customers flow through our top i don t know 10 airports so we re a big city airline and in other words we don t just using your words secondary we don t go nonstop secondary to secondary we in recent years as an example we ve added non stops from san antonio let s say to kansas city we re the no 1 airline in each city i would certainly not refer to them as secondary they re very substantial cities we ve got a lot of fans in both and those are very successful flights so i don t as i remember we ve got 85 48 state cities and they re the top 85 and in fact we tried to avoid the smaller cities because we fly as you well know we fly 737s and we just don t generate enough volume compared to what we could do in other locales so i think the net answer is we re used to competition i mean that s not going to go away that will continue to make us better and we are just continuing to play to our strengths and continue to expand strategically in a way that plays to our strengths jamie baker j p morgan analyst strong answers to both questions thank you gentlemen operator and moving on from morgan stanley we have rajeev lalwani rajeev lalwani morgan stanley analyst gary a couple of questions for you on the casm side first can you just walk us through the steps you took and the mitigants you pursued to kind of bring costs down to 3 3 5 and what sort of labor impact you have in those numbers and then secondly it seems like in the back half of the year you re going to be kind of flattish on unit costs why isn t that a good run rate to use going forward is it labor that can disrupt out a bit and maybe get you closer to 2 sort of that longer term target so just some thoughts there on sort of this year and then longer term garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer well tammy i might let you mike and tom kind of talk about how we got from there to here it s just i don t know if it was anything real fancy what was a little fancier was putting together cost initiatives that all of our leadership agreed and committed to which is a little bit more of a longer project but going through the annual budget is a grind and as i admitted my comments earlier it was coming in much higher than what i was expecting and we fessed up and told you all that and i think our folks have done a nice job in trimming that back but your point about 2020 is a good one and i will admit to you that s exactly where my mind will start in terms of expectations for 2020 it s something that s flat on a run rate basis but it s but i will also admit to you that it s a little too early to tell and until we the devil can be in the details and we definitely want to have more confidence that that is in fact the run rate before we just put these bold statements out there but we re 1 to 2 inflation over a long period of time and this is a very efficient company to begin with and we have invested significantly in driving more revenue and driving more fuel efficiency so i am proud of that and that s what you should expect from us going forward is on an annualized basis over a long period of time no more than 1 to 2 our goal as i said is to now bring that lower we are our aspirational goal among our leadership is to keep unit cost flat and so i can assure you with the cost initiatives that are under way that will be the expectation of the goal going into 2020 but it s far too early to tell you that that is our forecast for the year but tammy you want to color a little bit how we got from there to here tammy romo executive vice president and chief financial officer sure and i d be happy to do that and i do want to remind everybody on the last call we were early in our planning which there is normally a lot of scrubbing that we do when we get the original submissions on our annual plan what now clearly the inflation the read that we talked about that was because it was more than certainly what we were expecting and obviously what we had indicated to you all so i think the important point and takeaway today is the guidance that we ve shared with you obviously it was higher than 3 5 when we started the journey and through a combination of scrubbing our costs and changes we have made some tweaks to our schedule in the second half and we have continued fleet modernization which we ve also fine tuned our plans there we landed on the range that we provided here to you today so as i mentioned earlier we picked up some more airplanes and so that s we certainly expect to see some improvement from the fleet modernization efforts so really right now we re focused on execution this year and obviously already working on improvements beyond 2019 so and again i ll just remind you that we re back on a better casm ex trajectory in the second half of this year which is around flat year over year so we ll continue making tweaks to our schedule to balance our operational efficiency with our commercial opportunities so i think that s the more significant opportunity here in the second half of the year and as mike mentioned and i covered a little bit we re currently investing in operational technology projects and those should provide better tools to help us improve staffing efficiency and just allow our employees to eliminate pain points from their daily processes so as we look ahead just those are some of the types of initiatives that we have kind of in our bag of tricks here as we work to just ensure that we hit the trajectory that we ve shared with you today so that s really or probably the main points i d want to point out anyone else add anything garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer well and tammy i did want to make sure that everyone understands that i don t know if happy is the right word but i am not satisfied with unit cost growth in 2019 of 3 to 3 5 so don t get us wrong and we are taking corrective action right now that s what we that s what we re facing and we have had plenty of years in our history where we ve had 3 unit cost growth and it s just going to be one of those years but that s certainly not what you should extrapolate going forward we expect a lot more of our sales than that yes sir tom nealon president so tammy and gary this is tom tammy and gary talked about how we feel about 2019 and we ll work to hit that plan and we hit plans let me talk about beyond 2019 and how we re thinking about really the 2020 and beyond kind of cost thinking i guess i think it s really important to start with so where are we starting from and we are one of the most efficient airlines in the world by the way so we are very very efficient but we do have opportunities and i think that you d be at some point i do want to take you through this we want to take you through this but there we re working on the things you should expect us to be working on just an example we fly over 4 000 flights a day and every day you do have your regular operations so your regular operations by definition are inherently inefficient so what can we do to drive efficiency in recovering the network right during a weather outage or whatever it is so there is work going on that s just and this an example this is just in the network very very modestly transparent to the customer and net neutral to the revenue the whole thing just modest tweaks to things like that filter across the operations so driving out inefficiency is how we re thinking about this this is not just pruning things this is really thinking about the broader big processes that we use to drive the operations so in 2019 we re going to drive the budget we re going to drive the efficiency we need 2020 and beyond are bigger themes actually and that s how we re thinking about it garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer and just one other thing very quickly just to remind everybody what s driving the 3 3 5 it s a couple of basic things significant airport projects and investments around the country no 2 a heavier aircraft maintenance burden that is manifesting in 2019 no 3 we are seeing a step up in depreciation from deployment of more aircraft and also the deployment of technology projects so one of the things that we did for 2019 is we said let s just make sure that we are taking into account the benefits that should flow through our cost structure that a lot of these investments that are being deployed and that was a lot of the improvement that we saw since october i guess in the interest of time we ought to move on to our next question operator and we have time for one more question we ll take that last question from hunter keay with wolfe research hunter keay wolfe research analyst thanks for getting me on i was wondering if you might be so kind to compare your outlook for some of these hawaiian markets with bwi oakland which is kind of a high load factor low yield market but the point of sale it makes is obviously going to be very different i was wondering if you might think in time if given these factors the rasm performance in hawaii can be in line or better than how you deal in that market garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer that is a great question and i m going to sidestep it a little bit hunter because i don t like to talk about individual specific markets and their profitability we just always had a tradition of maintaining our thoughts sort of in a proprietary way about that setting the comparison aside for a second all of the forecast that we have done from a very significant point of strength in california to hawaii have been exceptional so i m expecting that they would form like a typical start up initially but they ll develop quickly and be very very satisfactory performers point no 1 what we were i think pleasantly surprised with is when we were urged to contemplate inter island flying which when we first revealed in october of 2017 that we were going to hawaii we were not thinking that it once we looked at that we were pleasantly surprised how it forecast as well and so i think on both aspects of that business the mainland to the islands and then the inter island both forecast well and based on our experience with forecasting and understanding our customers and our markets and the competitive dynamics we feel very very good about the viability of that or else we wouldn t have made the choice and the judgment to ramp that up very quickly we would have been much more cautious so we re putting our money where our mouth is and in any event as you know the exposure is limited and i think hawaii builds up to be a point tom or something like that of our capacity but that s sort of a backhanded way of saying we re bullish about it i don t intend it that way we re going to have a very viable schedule we have a lot of customers who are huge fans of southwest that we re confident will get on board hawaii is a huge destination which is you have to take that into account when you do the comps to other markets of comparable distance and we re going to do well is the bottom line and where our we continually update our forecast our judgment about this opportunity has been unchanged hunter keay wolfe research analyst now just a real quick one for you gary you said look out in the beginning of the call it was interesting it jumped out at me who were you talking to garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer whoever is listening we re it s been an emotional experience for our company to lose someone like herb and i can t remember whether you ever had the opportunity to meet him but the impact he had on people is absolutely profound and you will you get on a southwest airlines airplane and everybody feels like they know him everybody feels like they that he loves them and people are inspired so there s just no stopping us and it s all about our people in terms of making this airline work and they are as inspired as ever and they re the ones who win these customers they re the ones who win the fortune most admired and just on and on and on and it comes from the heart and there is no company in the world that is like this so whoever wants to get in our way better look out ryan martinez managing director of investor relations well i think that s a great way to wrap up there thank you for all the questions that concludes our analyst call and of course if you have any additional questions please give me a ring and thank you for joining us today operator ladies and gentlemen we will now begin with our media portion of today s call i d like to first introduce ms linda rutherford senior vice president and chief communications officer linda rutherford senior vice president and chief communications officer thank you greg and i d like to welcome the members of the media to our call today we ll jump right into the q a portion operator we ll take our first question from alison sider with the wall street journal alison sider air travel reporter the wall street journal hi thanks for taking the question you talked a lot about the shutdown the impact of the shutdown at a high level i was wondering if you might be able to give us a sense of whether it s becoming a problem for safety for operations whether you re seeing any kinds of delays either in the airport or in the air garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer well i d like thanks alison i d like for mike to have a chance to answer that too but i think the bottom line is no tammy and ryan put in the press release the dollar impact that we ve seen and that s pretty specific to government travel and that s something that we re comfortable that we can estimate you used the word safety it is safe and it will be safe i think the risk is that things slow down in order to retain a safe operating environment that s both from an air traffic perspective as well as an airport perspective so the i am so proud of our faa and tsa employees that i feel like they re doing a phenomenal job they shouldn t have to endure this and i think our whole country should offer their thanks to them for keeping the airlines running our business is one that is intimately tied in with the federal government the federal government touches every single customer that goes through the airport and they touch every single flight that we have and it goes beyond just those things but so far the operation mike has been actually superb since the beginning of the year but what would you like to add sir michael van de ven chief operating officer i think gary you hit all the high points i agree with what you said no matter what we will be safe it s just whether or not the volume of activity can keep pace with all the different staffing whether it s tsa or traffic control or things like that and so i do think that the longer that it goes the more risk that we have maybe there are longer people waiting times at checkpoints that the taxiing times may lengthen your in flight times may change it might be a little bit longer trail between airplanes so those are the kinds of things that i think we ought to be cognizant about garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer and again i also to be clear we re not seeing that in fact mike s operation the on time performance is better this year than it was a year ago so far so things are so far knock on wood are going just fine so this is all conjecture but those are the things that we re all worried about and this thing just can t go on i feel the faa has made a good point about what is the impact right now well they are not allowed to hire anybody if they did it wouldn t do any good because they re not allowed to train anybody and so they already have a hard time keeping their air traffic control positions filled and it takes years of experience to develop proficiency and this is harmful and so we know at some point down the road there will be some harm someway somehow but this is crazy it just absolutely needs to end and if left as it is it will harm the economy it will harm air travel i don t know what impacts are on other industries but these are important jobs or they wouldn t be there the notion that they are not essential is absurd they re all essential and so we just need to end sooner than later but right now knock on wood everything is running remarkably well and that s a real tribute to the federal government employees alison sider air travel reporter the wall street journal are you hearing any concerns from your crew from pilot to flight attendants are they coming to you with any worries about the sort of the robustness of the system garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer i ve never heard one mike any tammy tom but no never heard one i think in fact i would bet you and you re welcome to talk to anybody who will talk to you bet you you ll hear the same thing that you ve heard from me which is people are there and they re working hard i think any time i see anybody i thank them for their hard work and so should you when you travel or do things operator moving on we have tracy rucinski with reuters tracy rucinski u s aviation correspondent thomson reuters hi there again on the shutdown so far there aren t any signs of washington reaching an agreement to reopen is there anything that the airline industry can do or is doing to force an end to the deadlock garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer i think the short answer is no as you would expect the industry aligned with many other industries has communicated to leadership in the federal government that the risk of continuing this and the harm that can be done so absent that what else can be done and we re going to do everything that we can to find ways to mitigate this and not simply sit here and be victims about this but in the end this isn t we re dealing with a monopoly so we don t have the choice to go to someone else to provide our air traffic services or our security services it s just not available to us and this shouldn t work this way but it does so in the meantime we just need to have cool heads and attend to our business as best we can and we re determined here that we re going to have a very good year in 2019 no matter what and we ll do our best to work through this swamp tracy rucinski u s aviation correspondent thomson reuters and just a minor question again about the timing of hawaii you said that a chunk of your first quarter unit costs were due to start up costs from hawaii if that launch does end up rolling over into the second quarter will there be an additional unforeseen cost impact tammy romo executive vice president and chief financial officer yes this is tammy yes if that continues into the second quarter there will absolutely be a continued cost impact and obviously it depends on the duration there garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer but that s pretty much factored into your tammy romo executive vice president and chief financial officer that s all in our guidance garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer that s all in our guidance operator and next from flightglobal we have ghim lay yeo ghim lay yeo americas managing editor air transport flightglobal hi guys thanks for taking my questions i have a follow up about hawaii i know you plan to start inter island flying probably shortly after you get the faa approvals to begin hawaii service how soon afterwards can you actually launch inter island flying has that time line shifted at all now that you re not exactly sure when hawaii service will actually start garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer mike you want to talk about that michael van de ven chief operating officer yes so we re going to when we first start out hawaii we re just going to be focused on the mainland to hawaii flying for a period of time and then not launch into the inter island flying there ll probably after leaving a couple of months of service before we get into the inter island flying garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer but i think what mike had planned is we got our approval from the faa for our program by the end of december and that was a huge accomplishment i was very proud of our folks and very thankful to the faa they worked hard to get there all that was left during the month of january and mike had all this scheduled the date scheduled the task scheduled was to validate for the faa that we knew our program and that we could handle different scenarios that would be posed all that led to a schedule that assuming everything was passed if you will that we would be selling next week and mike had planned once we started selling that we would be flying sometime in february so now he s going to roll this so if we get started again with the faa let s say february 1 i think you can roughly allow a month and then we would be able to get our certificate and sell and then we would be flying in the following month and it just rolls so we that s roughly the amount of time that we re going to need from the time that we get back on task until we fly so it s somewhere don t hold me to this because it will still depend but it s somewhere around six to eight weeks i would say from the time that he starts working with the faa to finish to the time that we would be flying and then mike has to publish schedules for his flight crews and that is on a monthly cadence so it s so anyway that should give you some rough idea i think it is possible if we get started quickly that we could be flying in march we don t see a path to flying in february it s too late for february but we could be flying in march if we don t start with the faa again until next month it s going to be april so that s kind of a rough rule of thumb michael van de ven chief operating officer so let me just lay out for you there then we re going to launch a mainland service to one location we ll have mainland service to a second location and then as we get more hawaii locations out there we have more options then to connect in that inter island flying and that s why we will launch with the mainland service first and then follow on with the inter island flying ghim lay yeo americas managing editor air transport flightglobal sure and i have a separate question about mexico city are you able to see a little bit more about why that didn t work out was it mostly because top rate demand didn t materialize has there been any of sort of influence from what s been going on with the mexico city airport situation garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer right now our focus is primarily on destinations from our strong points in the u s the better performing destinations for us right now are the leisure destinations mexico city was showing very nice improvement it s much more of a business market and given where we are right now we just have better opportunities in terms of deploying that capacity i d love for us to be back in mexico city one of these days tom and his team are working on better commercial capabilities in terms of marketing in foreign countries accepting foreign currency and all of those things in our futures which would certainly support service to a place like mexico city better than what we have today but we just have better alternatives and like i said hopefully we ll be back in mexico city one of these days our priority right now obviously is adding hawaii service operator next question will come from dave koenig with the associated press david koenig reporter the associated press gary i think i heard you say that you ve southwest has communicated your concern about the shutdown to the government if i heard that if i understood that correctly anything you can say about who you have talked to especially any of the principles in the white house or congress garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer we have as a part of the trade association the trade association has communicated on all of our behalfs and off the top of my head i don t remember who was on that list but i m sure it was a long list of officials that received that communication david koenig reporter the associated press ok and have you gotten any feedback on what they heard and what was the response from the people that they talked to they i assume you re talking about a4a garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer i m talking about a4a and i don t recall any response i ve seen nothing i ve seen no response in writing i ll put it that way david koenig reporter the associated press ok is there what can you and i mean the airline industry do that you haven t done yet garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer i think all we can continue to do is to reach out to members of congress reach out to leadership reach out to the white house and there are i can assure you there are ongoing opportunities for us to do that and we will david koenig reporter the associated press all right thanks operator we have time for one more question we ll last hear from robert silk with travel weekly robert silk reporter the travel weekly you re fooling us by grumbling thanks so much so southwest aircraft was one of the ones that reported the drone on approach to newark a couple of days ago how big of an issue of a concern is it for southwest and other airlines obviously did the faa move quickly on new rules relating to drones that will make it easier for an airport s instruments to be able to tracked and also to detect them and essentially disable them garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer are you still there robert robert silk reporter the travel weekly did you not hear me michael van de ven chief operating officer yes i think so garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer we gotcha michael van de ven chief operating officer can you hear us robert silk reporter the travel weekly i hear you all i asked about drones do i need to repeat the question garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer no no we got it we got it michael van de ven chief operating officer so i m not this is mike i m not familiar with the near southwest airlines flight with a near drone opportunity there at the time but just generally speaking whether it is birds or birds strikes or drones or any other type of activity the airline industry is interested in making sure that the airspace especially above the airports coming into those critical times are well regulated and maintained so the industry is very supportive of having some type of regulatory requirements and oversight for drones by having them registered having them have certain requirements in terms of their operations trying to limit their availability especially in critical airspace close to the airports and i know that the faa is focused on that i know that and i think there are several other regulatory groups trying to figure out how we control all this new technology garry kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer they re focused on it when they re not on furlough so but that is a critical to having them off furlough so they can be focused on what is an important question operator and at this time i d like to turn the call back over to miss rutherford for any additional or closing remarks linda rutherford senior vice president and chief communications officer thank you greg appreciate it thank you all for joining us today of course if you have any other questions our communications group is standing by 214 792 4847 or you can certainly reach us through the media site www swamedia

it was the offhand comment heard round the world asked by anderson cooper on 60 minutes how she would pay for ambitious proposals such as a green new deal rep alexandria ocasio cortez the freshman phenom from a bronx queens district offered higher taxes on the very rich such as a 60 or 70 percent marginal rate on incomes at 10 million and above that triggered think tank and op ed page responses from left and right local and national and weeks later it s still being actively discussed on tuesday cnbc reported from davos the elite financiers attending the world economic forum are worried about ocasio cortez s proposal ocasio cortez hasn t backed down from the fight swiftly rebutting misleading arguments from prominent republicans who appear not to understand that a marginal tax rate kicking in at 10 million does not apply to incomes below that threshold nor to the first 10 million per year that people like bill gates and tom brady make why unlike the average young activist promoting investment in renewable energy and medicare for all does ocasio cortez want to talk not only about the popular public investments and social safety net expansions but also how to pay for them perhaps it s because she s from new york and she has seen the downsides of the accumulation of great wealth amid a sea of poverty and stagnant middle class wages the income disparity has grown for over 40 years throughout the united states thanks to a wave of corporate deregulation and consolidation while offshoring outsourcing and automation have decimated the ranks of unionized private sector workers and reduced wages for less skilled employees according to a 2017 study by the economic policy institute from 1965 to 2016 ceos went from making 20 times a typical worker s pay to 271 times as much aside from corporate executives the beneficiaries are the proliferating ranks of ancillary profiteers lawyers who protect corporations from the claims of mistreated employees or customers accountants who minimize a firm s tax liabilities management consultants who recommend how to wring more productivity from the worker bees private equity investors who load up firms with debt lay off employees and walk away with a fat bonus hedge fund managers who help the rich get richer and brokers of stocks and securities who are paid to gamble with other people s money all of these hangers on are heavily concentrated in a few metropolitan regions including boston chicago and san francisco but nowhere have they agglomerated in greater number than in new york city and its suburbs at the same time new york has seen its once mighty manufacturing economy dwindle to a tiny nub between 1970 and 2014 new york state lost 75 percent of its manufacturing jobs the largest share of any rust belt state and the new york city region lost 80 percent of its employment in manufacturing the worst attrition of any urban area in the state new york now has the largest income gap of any state the new york city area has the second highest of any metro region in the country after its neighbor bridgeport connecticut in 2016 according to the brookings institution a household at the 20th percentile in the new york city area had an income of 25 391 per year while a household at the 95th percentile made 304 292 notwithstanding all the hype about gentrification the city is less affluent than the suburbs especially at the bottom in new york city proper which ranks eighth most unequal among inner cities the 20th percentile income was 19 144 while the 95th percentile income is 282 125 ocasio cortez knows firsthand the inequity between city and suburb as she recalled on her campaign website the state of bronx public schools in the late 80s and early 90s sent her parents on a search for a solution she ended up attending public school in yorktown which is an upper middle class town in suburban westchester county the 40 minute drive represented a vastly different quality of available schooling economic opportunity and health outcomes she wrote contrary to former new york city mayor michael bloomberg s contention that an influx of billionaires would be a godsend ocasio cortez sees downsides of such extraordinary wealth as the rich get richer they have bid up the cost of housing in once middle class and working class neighborhoods to astronomical sums straining and displacing the existing communities according to a 2016 study of the 414 most populous counties by real estate data company attom data solutions brooklyn is the most unaffordable with manhattan coming in fourth and queens in eighth unaffordability was determined by the discrepancy between incomes and the cost of housing as marketwatch put it a person earning the average salary in brooklyn cannot afford the average home there even if he or she could spend his entire salary and then some on housing where once new york city was filled with middle class neighborhoods it s now starkly divided between rich and poor the former have bid up the price of housing in manhattan astronomically it is still more expensive than any of the outer boroughs but it also has higher incomes and now they are pushing into brooklyn and queens and sending prices soaring past the means of longtime residents some critics of ocasio cortez s proposal argue a very high tax rate would discourage those who make 10 million per year from reaching for their 11th million what they fail to appreciate is that ocasio cortez and her fans see that as a feature not a bug like a tax on climate pollution or cigarettes higher taxes on the super rich is not just a way to raise revenue it s a tax on a perceived social ill in this case inequality with the explicit purpose of adjusting corporate incentives so that pre tax income would have a flatter distribution and if they forgo that extra million by choosing not to boost their bonus by wringing more savings out of the workforce s wages so much the better during the 1950s and 1960s when the highest income tax bracket ranged from 70 to 92 percent and the u s economy grew at a healthier clip than it has ever since executives were paid substantially less this didn t mean they couldn t afford to live in new york city it just cost a lot less reducing incomes at the very top might help bring new york s housing costs back to earth and mitigate the inequity between gold plated suburban school districts and their poorer counterparts and so while other liberals might shy away from talking about big tax hikes on top earners ocasio cortez embraces it besides the drawbacks of huge inequality ocasio cortez s hometown also shows that higher taxes don t necessarily hinder economic growth as the atlantic s derek thompson notes the two most important hubs of innovation in the united states are the bay area and new york city but according to the tax foundation california and new york have the 48th and the 49th most favorable business tax climates in the country sky high tax rates in mountain view and manhattan haven t blunted their advantage why is it that entrepreneurs and companies like amazon choose regions with high taxes one reason is that the public services they support provide substantial benefits to corporations and foster economic growth for example it is no coincidence that the regions with the strongest economies are often those with the most extensive mass transit systems there also are productivity benefits to being in a city with a robust social safety net like how new york city s universal pre k reduces stress or time constraints for parents the most successful tech companies believe that a healthy happy and highly educated workforce produce and innovate more which is why they offer perks like free organic meals and gym memberships it s also why they locate in the creative capitals where workers want to live which often feature many first rate publicly supported amenities like parks museums or performing arts centers according to urban policy experts such as alan mallach at the center for community progress universities and hospitals two institutions that are usually nonprofits always publicly subsidized and often are publicly run are among the strongest assets that post industrial cities can have so ocasio cortez argues higher taxes to provide free universal health insurance and college tuition would ultimately benefit the economy even if it means as fox news sean hannity warned that demand for recreational boats will decline to many new yorkers less opportunity for the rich to indulge themselves would be a good thing
this article is part of the reshaping european democracy project an initiative of carnegie s democracy conflict and governance program and carnegie europe most debates about democracy in the eu overlook a crucial dimension of reform democratizing the global workplace the eu s reform agenda must focus on the underlying political economy of democratic participation a social blind spot since the 2008 2009 economic crisis many europeans have asked whether the eu can deal with economic shocks in a democratic way and whether this response will avoid undermining social policies and protections that benefit the majority of the population the interventions by the troika the european central bank the european commission and the imf into the greek economy as part of the european response to the sovereign debt crisis have left serious doubts that either of these questions will receive a positive response the troika attacked collective bargaining agreements in the private sector and imposed drastic pay cuts in the public sector many european citizens perceived these moves as well as the various memoranda and economic adjustment programs as undemocratically imposed greece may have exited the adjustment program in august 2018 but its experience weighs heavily in the minds of many europeans italy s right wing government has earned popular support for deliberately questioning the european commission s budget guidelines in the name of addressing poverty this shows how skeptical many europeans are about the eu s commitment to social welfare and democracy and it is precisely this skepticism the italian right wing is using to provoke a conflict and further undermine the commission s popular legitimacy such an approach has support beyond southern europe and if the commission does not reconsider it will find itself increasingly vulnerable to popular backlash starting in 2015 the european commission attempted to demonstrate its social awareness by resuscitating the long dormant social pillar of the european union the european pillar of social rights was signed by european leaders in 2017 while the document has no legal force it seeks to better implement existing european law by detailing twenty social rights and principles they cover equal opportunities and access to the labour market fair working conditions and social protection and inclusion the rights and principles are almost exclusively individual with collective bargaining only weakly mentioned in terms of social dialogue there have been other social initiatives led by the commission the recently completed revision of the posted workers directive which notably ensures that posted workers that is workers temporarily laboring outside of their own country benefit from collective agreements the european labour authority announced by european commission president jean claude juncker in his 2017 state of the union address to promote the spread of information coordination and dispute mediation across borders in the single market and programs on work life balance and workplace conditions niccolò milanese niccolò milanese is director of european alternatives and author of citizens of nowhere how europe can be saved from itself london zed 2018 this renewed emphasis on the social dimension is supposed to be connected to the european semester which is the commission s attempt to bring order to european economic governance thus the commission ranks the member states according to unemployment rates especially youth unemployment reduction in poverty lifelong learning access to childcare and other social indicators yet it does not measure the meaningfulness of work it also fails to assess whether workers have a say over the nature of their work their relationships at work their work s relationship to the greater economy or their working conditions in an age when more and more people classify their work as bullshit jobs to use the provocative phrase from the anthropologist david graeber something important is being missed 1 indeed there is a huge missing link between economic governance and social issues where economic democracy should be democratic economic governance in europe requires more than democratic institutions and procedures 2 furthermore stronger processes of social dialogue and negotiation are needed but also insufficient most importantly deep economic democracy in europe requires accounting for the changes in the nature of work what it does to the european system of political representation and how individual citizens relate to it the eu has not started this debate but research suggests that it will be crucial for addressing threats to democracy and the deep causes of populism structural shifts in political values a developing strand of sociological research studies the relationships between occupations and political outlooks and preferences following groundbreaking work by herbert kitschelt and philippe rehm using the european social survey 3 although sophisticated sociological modeling is required to demonstrate the relationships between occupations and political preferences there is a basic underlying sense that what a person spends most of their time on conditions their political outlooks this is too obvious to be ignored by policymakers in older class based politics which emerged from the industrial revolution and continued with the fordist mode of production governments and elites were aware of this fact and a homogeneous working class could more easily be presupposed indeed the alienation of workers from their work by the industrial mode of production was a central concern not only for karl marx but for all early sociologists trade unionists and socialists traditionally in western european countries at least trade unions and social democratic or socialist parties have provided intermediary bodies in which these issues could be addressed promoting political representation for workers and fostering socialization and cooperation among workers moreover the state itself and in particular the welfare state provides other areas for socialization between doctors and patients for example or between teachers students and parents during the cold war the omnipresence of the state in communist countries made it a primary space for socialization while civil society played a similar role in the west as the structures of production party support and the state are now shifting european democracy needs to develop new ways of reflecting such changes in the pattern of workers social interactions more recently in post industrial economies the membership and political power of trade unions has been declining the socialist and social democratic parties are finding their traditional bases splintering to the populist right and left and the state s capacity to promote open tolerant and democratic values has come under strain no democrat has a long term interest in significant parts of the european population being inadequately represented this deficiency calls into question the legitimacy of the entire system studies on the influence of occupations on political attitudes have made distinctions between technical workers technical experts technicians skilled craft workers and routine industrial and agricultural workers administrative organizational workers managers as well as skilled and unskilled office workers and interpersonal workers sociocultural workers skilled and unskilled service workers 4 technical workers focus on engineering design and development work which deals with considerable uncertainty about cause and effect thus relying on peer review and experimentation interpersonal workers are concerned with the perception development and well being of fellow humans this means they also encounter uncertainty and depend on interpretation only the administrative organizational field privileges authority obedience and domination above other aspects the studies of herbert kitschelt and philippe rehm using the european social survey show that in post industrial economies people involved in administrative organizational occupations tend to have more authoritarian views independent of their income status although those at the top may be less inclined toward redistribution and those at the bottom more inclined those involved in more interpersonal occupations which involve communication and agreement on norms and objectives tend to have more liberal views independent of their income status these axial changes in workers political attitudes cannot be dissociated from the globalizing tendencies that integrate markets while reducing the policy space available for individual governments at the same time multinational corporations play governments off each other to undercut labor rights and protections placing workers in cross border competition if unprecedented numbers of production workers mechanics carpenters assemblers and so on are looking to the populist far right 5 it is not only because of the nature of their work which may be becoming more rigid and impersonal but also because their work experience interacts with their perception of the larger political and economic environment and its insecurities the personal sphere links these workers affinity for authoritarianism to a preference for nationalism it is this nexus of attitudes that europe has a duty to address new forms of workers organization while the economy will continue to require organizational technical and interpersonal workers there are ways of addressing the attitudinal tendencies these occupations promote notably some forms of trade union organizing and cooperative business models can promote interpersonal interactions mutual recognition and norm setting among workers within and among sectors though these models must genuinely promote horizontal interpersonal activity and not reproduce a hierarchical logic moreover the interrelation of changing labor attitudes and globalization suggests that if these initiatives remain nationalized they will fail to address the massive macroeconomic changes under way unless they simply attempt to roll back globalization and break up integrated economies but this extreme scenario would cause massive economic damage and is beyond the power of any individual government or the eu in all probability it is impossible given technological change in the means of production although the current european commission has made social dialogue one of the twenty social rights it only says this dialogue ought to be held according to national practices and has taken no initiative itself previous commissions were more enterprising under jacques delors the commission created european works councils in 1994 which aimed to create transnational institutions to oversee employee participation in multinationals in 2003 romano prodi s commission introduced the legal category of european cooperative society and in 2004 the category of societas europaea set requirements for mandatory negotiations on worker participation at company board level as outlined in the 2001 council directive on employee involvement these initiatives were ambitious in comparison with many member states own efforts and in comparison with the current commission their further development would be desirable for a more democratic economy still it is striking that these initiatives are bureaucratic hierarchical and unresponsive forms of worker representation there is a danger that structures of this type do not promote the kind of self reflexive horizontal collaboration that reinforces open and generous political attitudes moreover it is questionable whether workers in such bureaucratic structures can be as nimble and strategic in crossing borders as their employers perhaps worker led initiatives can inspire different approaches particularly in parts of the economy most exposed to globalization and technological restructuring the annual strikes by amazon workers on black friday and prime day amazon s annual sale which have now happened for four years running are a good example of workers organizing for their political agency the highly alienating disciplinary working conditions in amazon distribution centers are widely documented in 2013 striking german amazon workers realized that their strikes were not as effective as they could be since amazon simply reallocated distribution to centers across the border to poland by 2015 the established german trade union verdi and a new trade union in poland inicjatywa pracowicza partnered whereby workers would strike simultaneously or work slowly in support of the strike across the border now black friday strikes are coordinated in most european countries strikes and other labor actions among food delivery drivers which have spread across the continent demonstrate similar transnational organizing what is more organizing in the gig economy and the new reactive fluid and horizontal trade unions which are being formed in response to the gig economy are often spearheaded by migrant workers and women who are finding agency amid a changing workforce here is perhaps one new example of european integration being led not from the top but horizontally prizing diversity and collaboration the current european commission has rightly targeted multinational corporations for tax avoidance and monopoly behavior the next commission could perhaps consider targeting multinational corporations to improve working conditions pay and the right to organize such actions should be part of a broader strategy to democratize the european economy as a whole from its governance to the ability of individual workers to organize and make decisions together about their work for all the new talk of social dialogue and social rights the overall approach of european economic policy continues to structurally undermine worker representation and gives more rights to companies than to trade unions the viking and laval judgments by the european court of justice in 2007 have become totemic symbols of the tendency to severely restrict the right to collective action and prioritize freedom of establishment for companies concretely this means companies have strong rights to establish themselves in any member state of the single market but workers have limited rights to conduct collective action to influence the practices of these companies reversing this dynamic will require both rethinking how workers representation should function in a globalized economy and finding a new balance between the right of companies to move across borders and the right of workers to organize across borders toward a democratic globalized economy it is no surprise that the european commission has not managed to fully connect economic social and democratic concerns doing so would require the commission to challenge the dogma that economic growth is the basic answer to all social problems to face up to its own role in undermining social cohesion and democracy simultaneously in the many parts of europe that have been exposed to austerity programs and to acknowledge that a technocratic approach exacerbates anti democratic tendencies and sentiments with the upcoming european summit in may 2019 the european parliament elections and the new european commission the union needs a much deeper and more nuanced appreciation of the changing dynamics of the global economy and its implications for political preferences in so doing it should follow the lead set by some of its most politically active working citizens thus in addition to considering a revised framework for protecting the rule of law and introducing a new european values instrument to foster a healthy democracy through civil society organizations the
