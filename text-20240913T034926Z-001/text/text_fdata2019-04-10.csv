washington dc the international monetary fund imf economic counsellor and director of the research department gita gopinath said one year ago economic activity was accelerating in almost all regions of the world and the global economy was projected to grow at 3 9 in 2018 and 2019 a year ago economic activity was accelerating in almost all regions of the world one year later much has changed she continued the escalation of the us china trade tensions needed credit tightening in china macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany and financial tightening alongside the normalisation of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half h2 of 2018 gopinath added that with this weakness expected to persist into h1 of 2019 the imf s world economic outlook weo projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 of the world economy global growth softened to 3 6 in 2018 and is projected to decline further to 3 3 in 2019 the downward revision in growth of 0 2 percentage points for 2019 from the january projection is also broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in h2 of 2019 this pickup is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential the us federal reserve the european central bank the bank of japan and the bank of england have all shifted to a more accommodative stance she elaborated additionally she explained that china has ramped up its fiscal and monetary stimulus to counter the negative effect of trade tariffs furthermore the outlook for the us china trade tensions has improved as the prospects of a trade agreement take shape these policy responses have helped reverse the tightening of financial conditions to varying degrees across countries emerging markets have experienced some resumption in portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the us dollar while the improvement in financial markets has been rapid those in the real economy have been slow to materialise measures of industrial production and investment remain weak for now in many advanced and emerging market economies and global trade has yet to recover she pointed out according to gopinath global growth in 2020 is projected to return to 3 6 this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies where growth is projected to increase from 4 4 in 2019 to 4 8 in 2020 specifically it relies on an expected rebound in growth in argentina and turkey and some improvement in a set of other stressed developing economies and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty growth in advanced economies will slow slightly in 2020 despite a partial recovery in the euro area as the impact of the us fiscal stimulus fades and growth tends toward the modest potential for the group given aging trends and low productivity growth while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks tensions in trade policy could flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains growth in systemic economies such as the euro area and china may surprise on the downside and the risks surrounding brexit remain heightened a deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries including sovereign bank doom loop risks she disclosed given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty does not weaken investment she highlighted fiscal policy will need to manage trade offs between supporting demand protecting social spending and ensuring that public debt remains on a sustainable path with the optimal mix depending on country specific circumstances financial sector policies must address vulnerabilities proactively by deploying macroprudential tools such as counter cyclical capital buffers a task made more urgent by the possibility that interest rates will remain low for longer monetary policy should remain data dependent be well communicated and ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience there is a need for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts to address climate change and risks from cybersecurity and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation according to gopinath risks skewed to the downside the outlook discussed in the preceding section envisages that global growth will stabilise in h1 of 2019 and recover gradually thereafter if the ongoing trade truce between the united states and china is resolved with a rollback of tariff increases enacted in 2018 rising business confidence and financial sentiment could lift growth above this baseline forecast the report shows some optimism about a positive resolution of trade differences between the united states and china is indeed already reflected in market valuations however the possibility of further downward revisions is high and the balance of risks remains skewed to the downside key sources of downside risk to the global outlook include trade tensions as global trade investment and output remain under threat from ongoing trade tensions the november 30 2018 signing of the us mexico canada agreement to replace the north american free trade agreement the extension past 1 march 1 2019 of the truce between the united states and china on tariff increases and the announced reduction in chinese tariffs on us car imports are steps in the right direction however final outcomes remain subject to a negotiation process in the case of the us china dispute and domestic ratification processes for the us mexico canada agreement in addition a proposal to raise tariffs on all imported cars and car parts remains under consideration in the united states failure to resolve differences and a resulting increase in tariff barriers above and beyond what is incorporated into the forecast would lead to higher costs of imported intermediate and capital goods and higher final goods prices for consumers beyond these direct impacts higher trade policy uncertainty and concerns of escalation and retaliation would reduce business investment disrupt supply chains and slow productivity growth the resulting depressed outlook for corporate profitability could dent financial market sentiment and further dampen growth downside risks in systemic economies the global growth profile is shaped by projections of a recovery in the euro area as one off factors dissipate avoidance of a no deal brexit some firming of growth in china as global prospects and policies stimulus measures take effect and a gradual softening of growth in the united states as fiscal stimulus fades the report indicates that the materialisation of risks in these economies would lower global growth directly and through real and financial spill overs in europe a protracted period of elevated yields in italy would put further stress on italian banks weigh on economic activity and worsen debt dynamics other europe specific factors that could give rise to broader risk aversion and a widespread increase in risk spreads include the rising possibility of a no deal brexit and european parliamentary election outcomes that delay or reverse progress on strengthening the euro area architecture in the united states the market implied path of expected policy rates remains below the federal open market committee s projections raising the possibility of a market reassessment of the expected policy path if the us economic data remains strong consequently this could result in higher us interest rates renewed dollar appreciation and tighter financial conditions for emerging market and developing economies with balance sheet vulnerabilities in the form of elevated currency and maturity mismatches while in china the authorities have responded to the slowdown in 2018 by limiting the extent of financial regulatory tightening injecting liquidity through cuts in bank reserve requirements and reducing the personal income tax and value added tax for small and medium enterprises other financial vulnerabilities remain possible according to the report such as cyberattacks on financial infrastructure which are another source of risk because they can severely disrupt cross border payment systems and the flow of goods and services additionally the report cites political uncertainty as a host of other potential factors that add downside risk to global investment and growth these include policy uncertainty about the agenda of new administrations or surrounding elections geopolitical conflict in the middle east and tensions in east asia according to the october 2018 weo these risk factors in isolation may not have a strong impact on investment and growth beyond the countries directly affected but a sequence of such events combined with trade tensions and tighter global financial conditions could have outsize effects on sentiment that reverberate on a broader scale

by johan burger the ntu sbf centre for african studies publishes a weekly newsletter on issues relevant to africa this paper is based on issues addressed in the newsletter africa has been the recipient of foreign investment form a variety of foreign countries in addition to the normal investors such as china japan india etc we are also seeing new entrants or countries that are making a comeback the countries identified below are also not meant to be the only investors but have been noted in the general media china in africa china has been quite active in africa for the past number of years in addition to participating in infrastructure development contracts it has also been financing a lot of africa s debt it is still africa s largest trade partner a prominent development is 2018 was china s outreach to african governments to participate in the belt and road initiative bri as well as the hosting of the forum on china africa cooperation in beijing china s activities in africa was quite visible as early as the first 2 weeks in january 2018 china s state owned sinopec was punted to buy chevron s assets in sa and botswana sinopec was competing for the assets with glencore who made a us 973 million bid sinopec had engaged in discussions with the economic development department edd to ensure that its strategy in south africa was aligned with the edd s policy on industrial and economic development the assets include a 100 000 barrel per day oil refinery in cape town a lubricants plant in durban and 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities it also includes 220 convenience stores across south africa and botswana sinopec has given additional commitments to the government including investments over 5 years post acquisition to upgrade the cape town refinery into a world class plant it also pledged to develop the fuel marketing business by introducing small and black owned business as fuel retailers sinopec said it will also establish a development fund targeted at small and black owned businesses thereby increasing the level of local procurement of goods and services china is becoming more visible in south africa it has invested in various sectors such as mining wine urban development and now the petrochemical industry it is interesting to note the withdrawal of a us company and it being replaced by a chinese state owned company in a certain way one could conclude that this is a trend becoming more visible in africa it also reflects a general move from the west to the east with africa increasingly turning away from the west towards countries such as china there is also the question of the sway china has over african governments given the level of investment in africa by china s government what is also interesting above is the commitment of sinopec to develop the industry to the benefit of small and black owned businesses in sa this is an important imperative to rebalance the level of ownership in the south african economy giving the black middle and upper class a greater stake in the economy china s eximbank has approved us 1 3 billion in financing for a utility scale hydroelectric plant in guinea the 450mw plant is expected to produce sufficient capacity to export to guinea s neighbouring countries the china water electric cwe began building the dam in december 2015 with construction expected to take about 5 years the loan will be reimbursed through electricity sales to neighbouring countries by a joint venture between the guinean state and cwe only about 25 of guinea s population has access to electricity due to failing infrastructure and mismanagement of the sector china has met with the leaders of namibia and zimbabwe undertaking amongst others to deepen cooperation with them under the framework of the bri this shows that the bri is available for many african countries and not just kenya djibouti and egypt china and zimbabwe have upgraded their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership which constitutes high level cooperation in the fields of economics and politics the two countries pledged to deepen cooperation under the framework of the bri during a similar visit by namibian president hage geingob president xi jinping and president geingob agreed to elevate china namibia ties to a comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership china undertook to find better synergy between the bri the africa 2063 agenda the un s 2030 agenda for sustainable development and namibia s harambee prosperity plan to achieve a win win cooperation china has always maintained that the bri was an inclusive initiative and not exclusively meant for the benefits of the few in addition its political coordination mechanism which includes bilateral and multilateral cooperation is currently utilized on multiple levels such as the forum on china african cooperation focac as far as africa is concerned the bri aims to enhance the roles of bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms using the existing cooperation mechanisms to intensify communication and promote regional cooperation these 2 principles open up the pool of countries in africa that could participate in the bri the above 2 case studies confirm this interpretation both zimbabwe and namibia have discussed participation in the bri with china s president and both are far removed from a narrow interpretation of countries eligible for participating in the bri it is also encouraging to see president xi jinping linking the bri with the au s agenda 2063 and the un s sdgs both multilateral agreements and namibia s harambee prosperity plan this approach links efforts to increase prosperity for one country with the efforts to increase wellbeing for the greater whole chinese

narendra modi to rwanda and uganda in 2018 signalled their growing interest in east africa in rwanda president xi signed 15 bilateral agreements and concessional loans and reiterated china s endeavour

government and china the chinese were also contracted to build manage and maintain the airport critics of the project had questioned the cost benefit of a new international airport especially as the existing airport at lungi is struggling to achieve its full capacity because of fewer international passengers every year the existing lungi international airport has recently been redeveloped with over us 200 million funding from the world bank stopping the mamamah project makes economic sense for a country that is struggling to pay for the delivery of healthcare education and access to water and electricity the government is planning to develop lungi as a commercial and tourist hub including the construction of an international conference centre new road infrastructure and an improved supply of water and electricity and is looking for private sector partners for collaboration in the various projects mentioned china has frequently been accused of lending too much money to african governments in the process putting them in debt distress examples in africa recently mentioned include djibouti and zambia at the latest focac meeting in china president xi jinping made it clear to african government leaders that they should refrain from spending money on vanity projects this new airport can 100 be seen as one that falls within the scope of the definition of vanity projects the decision by the new government to scrap the project of us 400 million must therefore be lauded more so given that the existing airport had recently been upgraded at a cost of us 200 million and that the tourist numbers are dwindling spending more on education and business development in the sectors of tourism and infrastructure roads water and electricity makes much more sense the government is looking for private sector partners opening up doors for investors from all over speaking about africa s indebtedness africa s external debt payments doubled between 2015 and 2017 according to the jubilee debt campaign repayments grew to 11 9 in 2017 from 5 9 of their revenue in 2015 fuelled by an increase in loans from multiple lenders a fall in commodity prices and a rising dollar value of the external debt owed by african governments 35 is to multilateral lenders 32 to private lenders around 20 to china and 13 to other governments to counter africa s debt challenges new rules must make all lenders publicly disclose loans to governments at the time they are given the imf must also stop responding to debt crises by bailing out lenders incentivising them to continue lending recklessly lenders must rather be made to restructure and reduce debts world bank figures show us 72 billion is owed to china with us 40 billion owed to the paris club and us 18 billion owed to other governments china is actually not in the league of top creditors of africa of the 16 african countries rated by the imf as in debt distress or at high risk of becoming so on average only 15 of their debt is owed to china china is made out to be the boogey man in the debt challenge of many african states most recently the examples of djibouti and zambia were held up as text book examples of how africa is being placed in a challenging situation by china for the latter to snap up prime properties in the case of default as had happened in sri lanka the question is once again to what extent are lender countries required to play the role of the conscientious banker that must ensure that the borrower has the means to repay the capital and interest before they are lent the money china s president seems to be sensitive towards criticism that his country is enslaving africa with debt to the extent that he warned african governments against vanity projects is this a case of too little too late the figures above do indicate that only 15 of the debt owed by debt distressed countries is to china it would be interesting to see to whom the other 85 is owed the fact of the matter is that africa should be its own guardian as far as debt levels are concerned a good example is that of sierra leone who scrapped the new airport project vanity projects or any project that does not produce the returns to repay the capital borrowed and interest payments social development projects are different sure should be scrapped as a point of departure bailing out lenders by the imf is not doing africa a favour either a worrying recent development which would see african governments getting access to more chinese debt was recently announced a chinese banking conglomerate wants to buy african infrastructure debts from the government starting next year repackage them into securities and then sell them to investors the new proposal could be problematic as it could put african countries in more debt for chinese financiers developers and multilateral development financial institutions this will offer further opportunities to make money from africa hong kong mortgage corporation will buy a diverse basket of infrastructure loans next year and explore the idea of securitising allowing it extra liquidity that it can use to finance more infrastructure projects african economies owed china and its institutions more than us 29 42 billion as at april 2018 in infrastructure loans this securitisation plan comes at a time when many african governments are seeking to either restructure their debts with china or get friendlier terms reading about this development raised thoughts about the 2008 09 global financial crisis with an eventual total capital investment of between us 4 and us 8 trillion for the bri should such a securitisation exercise go wrong it will have a far more devastating impact on the global economy than the 2008 09 financial crisis while it will have the benefit of releasing more funds for infrastructure and other development in africa it does run the real danger of exacerbating the debt levels of many african countries to an eventual extent that it becomes unsustainable this is already the case for some it cannot be denied that there will be potential investors who would want to tap into the available returns in the infrastructure development sector and to whom the securitised assets will be attractive the challenge will be when the ultimate borrower i e african governments defaults due to too high debt burdens and inability to repay in namibia a recent development entailed rio tinto signing an agreement with china national uranium corporation cnuc to divest of its 68 62 stake in the rössing uranium mine for us 106 5 million the transaction is subject to certain conditions precedent including merger approval from the namibian competition commission the company would work closely with cnuc to ensure a smooth transition and ongoing sustainable operation at rössing rössing is the world s largest open cast uranium mine and was scheduled to start closing down from 2025 however they have recently discovered 20 new pits next to husab uranium mine that will take them to 2032 and beyond according to the namibian local newspaper with the sale china will now have complete control of namibia s active uranium production with china general nuclear gcn owning the husab mine next to rössing egypt has been the recipient of a strongly growing chinese tourism stream since a comprehensive strategic partnership was agreed upon in 2014 which encompasses trade investment and political ties the numbers of the chinese tourists more than doubled in 2017 to 300 000 from 130 000 in 2016 egypt exported us 408 million worth of goods to china in 2017 60 more than in 2016 egypt has reached out to russia and china to diversify its foreign relations egypt is keen to attract chinese investors to the big infrastructure projects that are a major part of sisi s economic policy including the building of a new capital during sisi s visit to beijing in september 2018 he signed deals worth us 18 billion with chinese companies covering a railway real estate energy projects and an oil refinery chinese companies have close to us 6 billion of investments in egypt more than 80 of these were made in the last 4 years cumulative chinese fdi in egypt totalled us 24 3 billion egypt was diversifying its sources of financing while china was involved in building a railway in egypt locomotives and train carriages were being bought elsewhere china has been sending high level leaders to africa far more regularly than other countries the chinese foreign minister s annual visit to africa is a remarkable tradition the chinese leadership have made a total of 79 visits to 43 different african countries over the past decade there is no other country that can boast such a record china doesn t yet appear to favour the east african region over others even though the region appears as the entry point for china s bri nor does china seem to favour richer countries china has visited 26 of the total 33 african countries that are classified as least developed these visits from high level chinese dignitaries are conveying a message to africa namely that china views it to be important this message is backed up by high levels of support in infrastructure development this is one of the reasons djibouti had no qualms granting china the right to build a military base in djibouti in spite of usa opposition in contrast there were many reports on what the current us president thinks of african countries africa is therefore clearly experiencing two vastly different approaches russia in africa other foreign powers have also started to become more visible in africa this does not mean to say it is their first outreach to africa russia has also decided to join the competition for influence and trade in africa russia had agreed to supply sudan with a small capacity floating nuclear plant to produce electricity within 8 years the project is part of a plan to generate more than 5000 mw by 2020 russia has also reached out to ethiopia the two countries have agreed to reinforce diplomatic and economic relations to raise the level of theirs they will enhance ties in the economic area including trade and investment as well as in peace and security they also undertook to work on nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to boost the work of an intergovernmental commission for the sake of implementing joint projects in a number of domains such as energy biological research and direct flight connections amongst many others russia will also work with ethiopia for the peaceful resolution of security issues in the horn of africa such as south sudan this now makes it clear that ethiopia has become a country of importance we have also seen china reaching out to ethiopia in a meaningful way with support in a number of areas in addition to building railways from addis ababa and supporting other ventures china is encouraging chinese textile companies to relocate to ethiopia russia s promise to work with ethiopia for the peaceful resolution of security issues in the horn of africa must be giving the usa sleepless nights however as the saying goes if you snooze you lose while the usa china france italy and japan have military bases in djibouti and germany and spain troops are hosted by the french russia does not it therefore seems they have avoided overcrowding the already busy environment of djibouti by cooperating with ethiopia thereby still obtaining a strategic presence in an area whose importance seems to be increasing on a continuous basis it must be said that djibouti refused russia permission to develop a military base on its soil subsequently russia developed a logistics base in eritrea tanzania has also welcomed russian investors to the investment opportunities and incentives available in the country tanzania opened its doors to investors to benefit from investment prospects particularly in the manufacturing railway and pharmaceutical industries investment opportunities are also available in the construction sector real estate agriculture and infrastructure development the tanzanian government believed that it and russia could improve both the volume of trade and investment should they exploit the available opportunities tanzania has undertaken to create a conducive environment for investment including fighting corruption and enhancing the efficiency of the courts russia reaffirmed its commitment to foster a close relationship with tanzania with the russian ambassador emphasising his support to tanzania maintaining that russia is a reliable development partner as indicated above russia s expansion into africa is not only in the military domain but also in the economic sector russia is now involved in various countries from egypt algeria morocco and sudan in the north to mozambique angola namibia and zimbabwe in the south to the central african republic in central africa to nigeria in west africa and to ethiopia rwanda tanzania and uganda in east africa one specific focus area of russian investment is the development of nuclear power plants in africa given the critical shortage of electricity in africa there are various countries quite keen to take up russia on this opportunity currently china is still by far the largest contributor to investments in infrastructure development in africa it will be interesting to see to what extent russia will grow its involvement on the continent rwanda is another example of an african country that has embraced the opportunity to develop ties with russia the rwandan government has signed a memorandum of understanding with the russian state owned nuclear group rosatom this mou will be focusing on cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy this is the first agreement between the two countries regarding the peaceful uses of atomic energy under the agreement the two parties will deepen cooperation in the upstream and downstream nuclear power industry chain including the development of a nuclear infrastructure in rwanda it is expected that rwanda and rosatom will also set up joint working groups that will identify specific cooperation projects this is a continuation of a trend that is becoming increasingly more visible russia had reduced much of its footprint in africa after the demise of the former soviet union although there were military ties in some cases e g central african republic and sudan the focus of most visits has been economic by nature with nuclear energy infrastructure figuring strongly in the russian sales pitch we will no doubt see a lot more russian interaction in africa over the next few years south africa has also grown its investment ties with russia the trade volume between russia and sa increased by 26 to almost us 800 million in the first 9 months of 2018 russia hopes it will reach us 1 billion by the end of 2018 sa accounted for 20 of russia s total trade with all countries in the region sa believed more could be done e g exporting a number of sa s agricultural products building partnerships on water and agricultural technology and education and skills development russia and sa have signed an agreement for the implementation of joint projects in the market of platinum group metals as well as on the exploration extraction and processing of mineral resources until 2025 russia and sa are also working on joint projects in nuclear energy subsoil use oil and gas and projects in agriculture while china has tied up the ownership of namibia s uranium mines russia seems to be shopping for platinum in south africa as it is russian foreign minister sergey lavrov visited zimbabwe in march 2018 to revive a stalled platinum project a russian spv ojsc afromet is reportedly the russian representative in the joint venture in the darwendale platinum mine the platinum group metals apparently have a variety of potential defence uses lavrov s 2018 trip to zimbabwe included the signing of cooperation agreements in the military sphere and an effort to re invigorate the platinum project with the agreement with south africa on the platinum group metals russian could be in a very strong position regarding control over this resource in southern africa russia also visited namibia in march 2018 during which lavrov stated that russia and namibia were preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy which will enable joint construction of a nuclear power plant in namibia we are therefore seeing china and russia expanding its influence in southern africa as they have done elsewhere on the continent usa in africa in response to china s initiatives the then usa secretary of state rex tillerson had visited countries in africa in march 2018 to convince africa to rather support the usa in competition with china the countries included ethiopia kenya djibouti chad and nigeria a focus is the rise of china as an economic and diplomatic power to rival the west while tillerson insisted that africa is important to america s interests critics maintained that recent us engagement with africa has been focused too narrowly on ongoing counterterrorism battles tillerson s own plan to slash the state department budget for diplomacy and aid by 30 left him poorly prepared to match china s targeted investment us exports to africa during 2017 fell to just under us 22 billion us 38 billion in 2012 in 2016 chinese exports to africa were more than us 80 billion and imports from africa less than half that china plans to give us 60 billion in loans and export credits to african countries before 2020 and chinese loans already far outstrip those of the world bank the us military has been complaining that the us civilian commitment to africa is lagging behind the competition the chinese are building facilities in djibouti and a lot of infrastructure president trump also caused some upset in africa when he referred to african countries as shitholes tillerson s trip to africa has a number of possible objectives firstly he needed to convince african governments that trump s reference to them as shithole countries was reported out of context and that it was not true he would have had a difficult job in this regard secondly he needed to convince african leaders to not become too dependent on china as a provider of financing whereas being overly dependent on a single country is always bad not providing them with an alternative is not helpful thirdly somehow the usa needs to project themselves as caring about africa china has succeeded in positioning themselves as the frontrunners in this regard even the usa military are complaining about this as well as that the focus of the american effort is too military oriented the bottom line is that trump has created an impression that he does not really care about africa much more recently in november 2018 the usa awarded us 60 billion to the international development finance corporation idfc which will spearhead the financing of infrastructure projects and open avenues for us companies to increase investments in africa east africa will probably be the primary beneficiary in africa of the fund which was created to increase the usa s influence in africa and rival the growing influence of china in africa the idfc will oversee the funding of infrastructure projects like roads ports energy railways and dams in africa the idfc s us 60 billion is available for investing in both equity and debt in infrastructure projects across emerging markets it s a sign the usa acknowledges that africa is demographically destined to be a focal point for global commercial competition given its population of 1 2 billion growing economies and political stability while the us remains africa s largest donor committing us 12 2 billion in 2017 for health education and agriculture china and its agencies dominated in infrastructure projects us 75 billion in september china committed an extra us 60 billion in development finance during the focac summit in beijing this is in addition to the us 60 billion for infrastructure and other development in africa china promised at the focac 2015 summit in johannesburg japan has promised us 30 billion for investment india s total investment in africa is us 40 billion russia is also coming to the party albeit at still low levels whereas there always have been a number of usa corporations invested in africa the usa has recently been lagging in the race for africa s goodwill some of the usa s generals in africa have made the point that they cannot compete with the likes of china given the support the latter was giving to its allies in africa when the djibouti government gave china the green light to build a military base in the country and the usa objected the response was that should the usa invest commercially to the same extent that china does their point of view would be taken seriously the creation of the us 60 billion fund to oversee the funding of infrastructure projects like roads ports energy railways and dams in emerging countries is therefore a very timely initiative although long overdue usa companies can now get the financial support for investing in both equity and debt in infrastructure projects across emerging markets not all us 60 billion will be for africa though still this is a giant leap forward for usa companies interested in investing in africa s infrastructure projects turkey in africa turkey has also been continuing the expansion of its footprint in africa amongst others sudan has been the recipient of turkish investment pledges the vice president of turkey fuat oktay recently pledged to increase turkey s oil and agricultural investments in sudan he stressed that turkey would contribute positively to enable the sudanese to benefit from their rich oil agricultural and animal resources according to the vp turkey had provided sudan with expertise in education and health and described the joint military cooperation between the two countries as very distinct he also pledged to enhance cooperation in the fields of energy agriculture electricity livestock transport aviation health and education turkey would also open a bank in sudan to facilitate trade between the two countries in addition the vp promised to increase the flights of turkish airlines to khartoum and port sudan to promote tourism there are currently 288 turkish investment projects in sudan a turkish company undertook to support sudan s central bank with us 2 billion which would be used for importing petroleum products and wheat the agreement came within the context of the trade and economic cooperation between sudan and turkey turkish businesspeople were urged to establish a system to process sudan s gold and integrate them with turkey s gold exchange market to provide overseas finance for sudan five consortiums were created with sudanese and turkish business executives in the fields of construction energy mining agriculture and machinery whereas some countries are casting a doubtful eye on sudan others are seeing the opportunities waiting to be exploited it is clear turkey is stepping in to help sudan survive it shares the limelight in sudan with china and russia with qatar also making an impact in spite of all the support sudan is getting it is still struggling under a major liquidity squeeze with serious cashflow shortages given sudan s strategic position along the red sea it is strange to find no western world country investing in any serious way in sudan the investment opportunities are many in spite of the many challenges in east africa tanzania businessmen and traders have been urged to be aggressive and grab the partnership opportunities being offered by their counterparts from turkey turkish investors have shown a keen enthusiasm to invest in tanzania most of them are eager to team up with local partners areas which appeared to be of more interest to potential turkish investors include agriculture construction industries energy and the hospitality industry some of them were willing to invest in tanzania immediately financing of projects appear to not be a problem for turkish businessmen as they have many funding sources president erdogan proposed that african countries shun international currencies in favour of their local currencies when engaging in international trade as this was one way of waging a struggle for economic independence turkey is clearly intent to increase its footprint on the continent in a significant way in this regard its middle east neighbours have also recognised the potential that africa presents in the one corner we have qatar who frequently finds itself on the same side as turkey in the other corner saudi arabia and the uae are also reaching out in a meaningful way even though it is mainly in east africa although some of them are seemingly more intent to position themselves for geo political reasons rather than for business and trade others are investing increasingly in business opportunities including trade in africa turkey seems to be falling into the latter category slowly but surely africa is finding an increasing number of investors these investors are moving into africa in spite of the risks recognising that most risks can be mitigated qatar in africa the gcc states have also started to target africa in a more focused manner qatari businessmen have expressed an interest to explore investment opportunities in cote d ivoire s agriculture mining tourism and real estate sectors a recent meeting between stakeholders from both countries focused on ways of enhancing economic and trade relations between qatar and cote d ivoire and the establishment of business alliances and partnerships between qatari and ivorian businessmen the visit of the qatari emir to cote d ivoire last year established a roadmap to both countries relations at various fields especially in the economic and investment opportunities the qatari dignitary said the ivorian economy is open and offers various investment incentives for foreign investors president ouattara encouraged qatari businesses to invest in his country and benefit from the opportunities it offers in the agricultural industrial and real estate sector qatar is the largest exporter of lng in the world and has the third largest reserves it does realise that this is a finite asset and has been investing in assets in various countries cote d ivoire has significant natural resources in various fields and is among the world s largest producers and exporters of coffee cocoa beans and palm oil yet it is a poor country having qatar invest in it is an obvious way to stimulate the economy to the benefit of all it is also interesting to see qatar s expansion into africa in itself a very small country with less than 2 million inhabitants of which less than 300 000 are qatari s it is punching far above its weight africa has become a focus of its rulers both in west and east africa qatar s minister for foreign affairs also visited sudan to boost the strategic relations between the two countries in the various domains in addition a number of british businessmen expressed their willingness to invest in sudan in the fields of alternative energy and agro industrial projects especially after the lifting of us economic sanctions pointing out that sudan has promising opportunities for investment india in africa the competition for africa between india and china appears to be heating up china has its bri and has recently stated that the whole of africa can participate in the bri india subsequently responded with its asia africa growth corridor the aagc will be focusing on 7 countries in east and southern africa as well as 4 indian ocean islands the two initiatives are not really comparable as the bri is vastly superior in scale and scope having said that this has not stopped the competition between india and china in africa during a recent visit of pm modi to china the 2 countries leaders agreed on a number of issues but pm modi refused to back down on the aagc the outreach of these 2 asian giants to africa raises questions about the unwillingness of other countries to launch similar initiatives of a comparable scale turkey is an example of a country that is increasing its footprint in africa we are also seeing russia reaching out although it still has a long way to go to reach a similar footprint africa needs partners who have made a long term decision to remain invested japan has a strong technological knowledge base to offer ethiopia and africa this is exactly what its contribution is stated to be in its partnership with india in the asia africa growth corridor contributing towards a stable and inclusive economy and society will go a long way to help african governments deal with their socio economic challenges africa is also in dire need of technically trained people this kind of contribution will help africa a lot japan in africa japan was clearly eager to avoid the challenges associated with the high level of indebtedness of the african countries it made it clear that it would assess the economic viability of projects and debt sustainability of african countries before granting them loans as it pushes for high impact projects that can generate enough income for loan repayments japan undertook to push for sound debt management by african governments and will insist on transparency openness and economic efficiency they will also look at projects lifecycle costs as well as the debt sustainability of recipient countries before funding them japan and china have recently been wooing africa with project loans as they jostle for influence japan has provided more than us 10 billion in infrastructure loans to africa the past 3 years it has avoided the china model of government to government funding preferring aid agencies and private sector financing japan is projecting itself as a responsible lender paying the role of a good banker who would not lend money to a bad risk private sector financing does bring a different dimension as they do not have the luxury of either recouping non performing loans or writing them off this way you make sure no vanity projects will be adopted this is also one of the major points india and japan have been emphasising in their asia africa growth corridor i e that china s gtg funding has certain negatives which the private sector route does not it will be interesting to see whether china would also move to involve the private sector or whether it would play the role of the conscientious banker itself at government level in a recent interview with japan s ambassador to ethiopia he shimizu he stated that africa is becoming a very important continent also for japan the size of its population is important as is its growing economy the relationship between japan and the au or the african states is growing deeper every year by establishing a new mission to the au japan intends to tackle economic political and social challenges on both sides there are many global issues that need cooperation between japan and africa four major topics were to be discussed at the recent ticad meeting trends and changes in africa and its cooperation with japan economic transformation for inclusive growth creating a healthy sustainable and stable society and strengthening connectivity in africa and beyond ticad has offered africa and ethiopia the following social stability to ensure shared prosperity and structural economic transformation through economic diversification and industrialization african countries also need the requisite human resources to support this gap japan has provided training for more than 48 000 africans since 2013 singapore in africa singapore has also increased its footprint in africa in 2018 singtel announced it would invest us 250 million in airtel africa airtel to tap into africa s growing use of mobile money and mobile wallets airtel has secured us 1 25 billion from international investors which includes temasek holdings singapore and softbank group international japan airtel is a subsidiary of bharti airtel which has operations in 14 african countries including ghana kenya and nigeria singtel holds a 39 5 effective stake in the parent company with only 25 of africa s population having access to formal banking services mobile money has become the engine for financial inclusion for both individuals and small businesses singtel s investment into airtel is an indication of their confidence in africa s long term growth potential with its young and growing population the margins in the mobile telephony market are quite high delivering very attractive returns vodacom for example delivered an ebit margin of 26 8 in its latest financial results announced in june 2018 mobile telephony has also been playing a major role in increasing the level of financial inclusion on the continent in kenya for example the level was 42 in 2011 this increased to 75 in 2014 and subsequently to over 80 in 2016 in 2017 m pesa reported 32 million customers across africa the growth potential in africa for mobile money is still enormous making the sector an attractive investment opportunity the nordic countries in africa other non traditional investors include those from the nordic countries nordic businesses are tapping into opportunities in ethiopia despite challenges in the business environment potential investors and policy makers discussed the exploitation of these new opportunities at a recent conference there are great opportunities in long term projects especially in local production of any kind whether for export purposes or domestic consumption the industrial parks access to bank loans financial incentives and access to new sectors like telecom energy and logistics are clear signals by the government showing the willingness to change learn and support both local and foreign investors local pharmaceutical production import of medical equipment and technologies improving e health systems knowledge transfer and capacity building are some of the investment opportunities in the country in the health sector the 5 university hospitals in the country are all expanding and looking for partners and investors to either collaborate or sign turn key agreements with there should be a greater focus on developing the export sector by means of financial incentives and training local companies in export management these nordic corporations include the likes of the well known ericson and h m the opportunities in ethiopia are vast for those with the requisite risk appetite it is good that the nordic countries which include denmark finland iceland norway and sweden have targeted ethiopia bringing their business acumen and technology competencies to ethiopia can only benefit the latter it is also an indication that they have trust in the future of ethiopia including in the governance of the country the fact that the whole horn of africa is stabilising to a greater extent with eritrea and ethiopia normalising their relationship and somalia also reaching out creates a region that is becoming much more attractive than used to be the case a few years ago egypt as source and destination of investment egypt has frequently been punted the last few years as an attractive business environment and investment destination it is interesting to note that since sisi took over as president in 2014 russia has also become more prominent in egypt in addition to building a 2000 ha industrial park along the recently revamped suez canal russian tourists are also increasing in numbers it is estimated russia will invest around us 4 6 billion in the construction of the industrial park by 2035 egypt is therefore clearly not depending on china as an investment and trading partner also it is clear that it is finding allies outside of the usa and the eu it is not only turkey that has demonstrated an interest in tanzania egyptian investors seem quite keen as well while tanzania has competed for foreign investors with ethiopia its business reforms are increasing its attraction the egyptian investors are interested in business opportunities in agro processing textiles and construction materials they were also impressed by the strategic and geographical location of tanzania surrounded by other eac countries that offer them a bigger market for expansion into the region the egyptians are also keen to launch their ventures into the sadc through tanzania tanzania offers various additional benefits such as industrial parks epzs and raw materials infrastructure improvements such as electricity and water will reduce operational costs for investors however one has to raise concerns over the actions of president john magufuli his latest move has been to fire his ministers of agriculture and trade over the issue of low cashew nut prices as well as disband the cashew nut board he also ordered the army to buy up all the cashew crops in tanzania after he had ordered a 94 increase in the cashew price this is but one of his latest interventions the acacia mining case study is well known as are his actions to curb press freedom he seems to be very sensitive to criticism in the media whilst his actions to gain control over the agri economy can be criticized depending on where one stands i e are you a farmer or cashew processor the entry of egyptian investors is an indication of support it remains to be seen to what extent current investors will remain in tanzania some of them might actually disinvest and exit via a sell out to the egyptians the author johan

flexible brexit extension uk free to leave whenever it s ready in a letter to european council member president donald tusk urged eu27 states to considering uk s request for article 50 extension at

end of june he also warned granting extension to june 30 would increase the risk of a rolling series of short extensions and emergency summits creating new cliff edge dates thus tusk proposed a flexible extension which would last only as long as necessary and no longer than one year uk is free to leave whenever it is ready and importantly a long extension would provide more certainty and predictability while uk is allowed to rethink its brexit strategy tusk also laid out the conditions for the extension no re opening of the withdrawal agreement no start of the negotiations on the

subsidies both promised to have no forced transfer of technologies as price for investment and both commit to create a level playing field fed clarida flatter philips curve makes anchoring long run inflation expectations more important in a speech fed vice chair richard clarida said neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the us and abroad and this global decline in r is widely expected to persist for years he emphasized the importance of the trend as all else being equal a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank s policy rate will reach its effective lower bound elb in future economic downturns and that in turn could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support household spending business investment and employment and keep inflation from falling too low clarida pointed to another key development in decreasing responsiveness of inflation to resource slack that is short run phillips curve appears to have flattened implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment he warned that a flatter philips curve increases the cost of reversing unwelcome increase in long run inflation expectations and a flatter phillips curve makes it all the more important that longer run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective kuroda boj seeking to create positive economy cycle not just rise in inflation speaking to the parliament boj governor haruhiko kuroda said the central bank isn t seeking to push up inflation alone instead it s aiming at creating to situation where wage and employment conditions improve with corporate profits too that is creating a positive economy cycle meanwhile kuroda added the 2 inflation target helps in long run currency stability but for now inflation is likely hover around 1 since wages growth is not fast enough yet separately finance minister taro aso also told the parliament that pushing up inflation alone won t do any good without improvement in people s livelihoods rba debelle lenses of labor market and gdp in sharp contrast business surveys sit in between australian dollar rebounds after initial selling as speech of rba deputy governor guy debelle echoed much of recent communications there was no extra dovishness in his comments he noted that the weaker than expected gdp growth in second half of last year was primarily due to considerable slower growth in consumption the main explanation is low growth in household income and an increasing expectation that it is likely to remain low however other parts of gdp have evolved broadly as we had expected business investment outside mining has been growing at a rate exports have continued to grow as expected residential construction is at a historically high level also labor market has been surprisingly strong debelle noted that the two lenses on economic growth provided by the labour market and the gdp data are in stark contrast meanwhile a third lens in the form of business surveys sits in between the two and he noted that the tension highlighted by these different lenses on economic growth is of crucial importance hopefully we will get some resolution of this tension in the coming months with the incoming flow of data imf lowers 2019 global growth forecast to 3 3 but expects pick up in h2 in the world economic outlook report imf revised down global growth forecasts as weakness in the second half of 2018 is expected to persist into the first half of 2019 imf expects slowdown in 70 of world economy global growth would dropped from 3 6 in 2018 to 3 3 in 2019 revised down by 0 2 there were negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia nevertheless imf still expects growth to pickup again in second half of the year there will be support from significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies fed ecb boj and boe have all shifted to a more accommodative stance meanwhile china has ramped up its fiscal and monetary stimulus outlook for us china trade tensions has also improved as the prospect of a trade agreement take shape global recession is not in the baseline projections however imf maintained there are many downside risks including trade tensions that could could flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains growth in eurozone and china may surprise on the downside brexit risks remain heightened

lekan sote in the mid 1980s the international monetary fund proclaimed the hoax that before nigeria s economy could improve it must adopt a marketplace economic policy liberalise the importation of consumer goods and devalue its currency against the american dollar through regular auctions the then military president ibrahim babangida bought the hoax that ended in the most harrowing experience for nigerians from about 60 kobo the naira plunged to a recent low of about n360 to the dollar in the parallel market the same imf is now making fiscal interventions to increase the tax burden of nigerians yet it famously fails to give macroeconomic suggestions to halt nigeria s compulsive importation of consumer goods anyway imf s primary purpose is to ensure the stability of the system of exchange rates and international payments that enables countries and their citizens to transact with each other that is doublespeak for a guarantee that countries like nigeria will pay for their imports from the west the conniving imf recently welcomed nigeria s tax reform plan to increase non oil revenue through tax policy and administration measures and stressed strengthening domestic revenue mobilisation through additional excises a comprehensive vat reform and elimination of tax incentives imf argues that the tax reforms should generate revenue for government as it broadens income and consumption taxes closes loopholes created by corporate tax holidays and expands the internally generated revenue of sub national tiers of government otherwise known as state and local governments imf is confident that nigeria s economy is recovering real gdp increased by 1 9 per cent in 2018 up from 0 8 per cent in 2017 on the back of improvements in manufacturing and services supported by spillovers from higher oil prices ongoing convergence in exchange rates and strides to improve the business environment this claim of improvements in manufacturing is false even imf s sister organisation the world bank has cut its growth forecast for sub saharan africa this year to 2 8 per cent from an initial 3 3 per cent while recognising that nigerians currently have weak disposable incomes victor chiazor of fsl securities limited argues that if this increase in taxation is implemented it will boost government revenue and help reduce the need for government borrow the manufacturers association of nigeria rejects the call for increase in taxation at this time that the economy is fragile saying that businesses are providing for themselves many of the services that should be provided from taxes already paid viz power water and roads man also thinks that an increase in the value added tax will not be a right move at this time those who say vat must be the same throughout ecowas must be reminded of article 30 of the ecowas directive on harmonisation of member states legislations on value added tax which only provides that each member state shall have the liberty to fix the vat rate applicable to taxable operations within a bracket ranging between 5 and 20 per cent the lagos chamber of commerce and industry argues it will be insensitive to contemplate an increase in vat rate at this time admittedly we have a major revenue challenge as a country which is why the debt stock had been increasing and the sustainability of debt is becoming a major cause for concern the debt management office recently announced that nigeria s debt profile stood at n24 39 trillion by december 2018 ending the debts were acquired to fund infrastructural projects budget deficit and maturing obligations the dmo should clarify that the debts were applied to salaries overheads and avoidable wastage but in spite of government s need to borrow because of decreasing revenue from oil sales the federal government appears to agree with man lcci and organised private sector groups who will bear the burden of increased taxation the minister for finance zainab ahmed rejected calls for increased taxation she said to change the taxes means we will review the tax laws that may be a process we will address in the future but right now we don t have any plan to review the taxes upward in nigeria she revealed government s option to identify people who are supposed to pay tax but they are not paying she also gave the assurance that a lot of effort is put to expand the tax base as well as improving the tax collecting processes and it is yielding results an american senator argues that increased taxation will discourage foreign direct investment even the national leader of the ruling all progressives congress bola tinubu thinks that an increase in vat at this time could be counterproductive so why is the imf so intent on increasing the tax burden of nigerians maybe the gains of the west from the structural adjustment programme of the mid 1980s are not enough now they want to use the feminine wiles of madam christine lagarde to con nigeria into adopting policies that will be disastrous to her economy once again instead of encouraging nigerian state actors to weed out the sources of waste in public finance the imf wants the government to kill off the few businesses that are surviving despite the extremely unfriendly economic environment the imf is not coming to nigeria with viable macroeconomic policies to increase domestic productivity and thus enhance the capacity of nigerians and their businesses to pay tax it s not enough to just sloganeer that a people that pay tax get to own their government they must first make the money despite admitting just two weeks ago that greece that took the title of sick man of europe from portugal and that it remains a country confronted by elevated vulnerabilities and weak payment discipline the imf merely recommended that greece should find ways to help employers more easily adjust to changing market conditions and lower tax rates while still boost revenue obviously what is good for the western greek goose is not good for the south s nigerian gander with friends like the imf nigeria will have no further need for enemies it looks like the imf wants to permanently sink nigeria into the misery index compiled by johns hopkins university s steve hanke who rates nigerians the sixth most miserable people in the world for those who don t know the misery index is the sum of the unemployment inflation and bank lending rates minus the percentage change in the real gross domestic product per capita hanke notes that higher readings on the first three elements are bad and they make people more miserable in her many interferences into the economy of nigeria madam lagarde never offered whatever the imf could do to help revive nigeria s moribund real sector the service sectors like telecommunications where the west has profitable investments are doing just okay anyway as a mark of goodwill the imf could assemble the world s electricity infrastructure experts and give them a mandate to help nigeria in the generation transmission distribution and metering of electricity for the more than 90 million nigerians that minister for power works and housing babatunde fashola and the world bank agree are living without electricity supply the experts could help to upgrade nigeria s renewable energy and conventional power plants and address deficiencies in transmission of electricity generated to be able to make available to the consumers the 2 000 megawatts that is lost from the 8 100 megawatts that vice president yemi osinbajo claims the electricity generating

martins ifijeh in washington dc the international monetary fund imf has advised the federal government to initiate policies that would enhance the contribution of the private sector to nigeria s economic growth the fund also stated that the trade tension between the united states and china as well as the tension in the european union over the brexit would negatively affect the performance of nigeria s economy even as it called for proactive policies to mitigate external shocks in the same vein the fund reiterated that nigeria s gdp projection had been cut from the 2 3 per cent projected in october 2018 to 2 1 per cent as of january 2019 responding to a question during a media briefing on the imf s world economic outlook at the ongoing imf world bank spring meetings in washington dc yesterday the chief economist and director of research department imf gita gopinath said global trade tension was increasingly taking a toll on business confidence and called for tightening of financial conditions for vulnerable emerging markets nigeria inclusive gopinath specifically said trade tension between the united states and china could erode business confidence in nigeria and other countries which depend on exported goods and services nigeria is china s biggest trading partner in africa and africa is china s biggest trading continent globally and it is believed the trade war could cause hike in prices and reduce business engagement in nigeria gopinath said brexit and softening oil prices are the main risks for nigeria what is very important is the oil price so to the extent that other global risks transmit into a weaker oil price or there are other developments that are oil market specific that would be a factor weighing on nigeria we expect a growth recovery for the country growth was reasonably strong last year and we think that things will improve a bit going forward we cut our forecasts for 2019 precisely because oil prices are going to be a bit weaker than we expected last time we did the forecast therefore the imf official stressed the need for policymakers to be cautious fiscal policy needs to tighten further for which mobilising more non oil revenue is very important she said adding for monetary policy it has to stay tight for some more time it has to be well communicated and transparent there has been some convergence on the exchange rate front there is also much more that needs to be done there and the structural reforms all of these has to be put in a context of reforms that help boost private sector performance also the deputy director research department imf gian maria milesi ferretti said low and middle income countries that rely mostly on oil could experience additional public financial stress following dwindling oil prices he said in whichever case there should be social security for vulnerable population in any country such that they are protected from further hardships in general the released world economic outlook showed that the world economic situation was deteriorating with many poor countries already struck by debt crisis continuing gopinath said global growth softened to 3 6 per cent in 2018 and was projected to decline further to 3 3 per cent in 2019 she said the downward revision in growth for 2019 reflected the weakness in major economies in europe latin america the united states united kingdom canada and australia she stated after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 this pickup is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures in spite of growing at near potential the us federal reserve the european central bank the bank of japan and the bank of england have all shifted to a more accommodative stance china has ramped up its fiscal and monetary stimulus to counter the negative effect of trade tariffs gopinath called for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts address climate change and risks from cyber security and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation she said that monetary policy should remain data dependent well communicated and ensured that inflation expectations remained anchored meanwhile the european network on debt and development eurodad a major network of european civil society organisations working on development finance has warned that progress on sustainable development goals could be derailed or even reversed adding that poverty and inequality could rise if counter measures are not taken the head of policy eurodad bodo ellmers said high debt levels became a key constraint for spending on infrastructure projects and public goods in poor countries every euro that goes to creditors is a euro that does not go to poverty eradication and sustainable development he warned that imf needs to do more such that their programmes do not harm poor people adding that when crisis strikes imf loans are often the last resort for affected countries but they come with harsh austerity and adjustment conditions attached the imf conditionality review that takes place while the spring meetings are ongoing should be used to ensure that imf programmes respect democracy and human rights we also call on the imf to conduct human rights impact assessment of all its programmes ellmers said
world economy loses steam with quarterly report projecting slowdown for 70 percent of countries the global economy is facing a delicate moment beset with risks as the recovery loses steam amid trade tensions brexit and other factors the international monetary fund warned on tuesday the imf s world economic outlook once again downgraded global growth to 3 3 percent for 2019 two tenths lower than the global crisis lender forecast in january and four tenths lower than october and while world growth is expected to pick up in the second half of this year and hit 3 6 percent in 2020 many things will have to go right for that to happen including a resolution of president donald trump s trade battle with china the quarterly report projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a statement but stressed that global recession is not in the baseline the euro area is likely to slow sharply particularly in germany where the gdp forecast was cut by a half point and italy which has slowed to a virtual standstill according to the quarterly report and amid the turmoil over its exit from the european union the imf downgraded the outlook for britain this year and next warning of a severe impact if london crashes out with no agreement emerging economic powers china and india continue to show the highest growth rates 6 3 percent and 7 3 percent respectively beijing has rolled out a series of fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the hit from the u s trade war as well as the clampdown on the boom in lending but india s growth was downgraded by two tenths of a point and while the recent signs that officials in washington and beijing are engineering a trade deal have calmed some of the nerves in financial markets the solution is by no means certain the report cautions that downside risks to the outlook continue to dominate trade tensions could flare up again and there is risk of a no deal brexit withdrawal or persistent slowing of economic activity this is a delicate moment for the global economy gopinath said this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies including argentina and turkey she urged policymakers to steer clear of potential pitfalls and warned that if any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries may be derailed given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided she said urging cooperation among governments especially in trade conflicts to avoid fueling uncertainty that could contribute to a slowdown the challenge to policymakers is they have little ammunition with which to counteract a slowdown since interest rates are low and most central banks already have stopped raising or started cutting rates while debt levels are high crimping the ability to provide fiscal stimulus gopinath told reporters there is some room to use monetary policy to support economies as long as inflation remains low but critically a durable resolution of trade uncertainty created by the u s and china would be very positive for global growth she said in a press briefing also warning against expanding the dispute to more sectors the broad based slowdown most notably in advanced economies was larger than expected and apparently due to the souring of market sentiment partly due to the trade tensions the imf said trump s aggressive trade policies largely but not exclusively aimed at china left u s products open to retaliation in the form of steep tariffs but inflation pressures remained muted despite the new duties which raised the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports trump also has threatened tariffs on european autos and on tuesday said he was prepared to unleash punitive measures against 11 billion in imports including helicopters aircraft parts and gouda cheese over subsidies to aviation giant airbus global trade growth has slowed sharply from its peak in late 2017 and expectations for future business activity have weakened pointing to slowing momentum ahead the imf said growth in advanced economies next year presents a mixed picture the united states and japan are expected to slow further next year with u s gdp adding 1 9 percent and japan s just 0 5 percent half of this year s rate but with temporary factors waning germany s growth is projected to accelerate to 1 4 percent and italy to 0 9 percent spain is the strong performer in the euro area with 2 1 percent growth in 2019 and 1 9 percent in 2020 in the major emerging markets china s expansion will slow to 6 1 percent while india continues to accelerate to 7 5 percent the imf downgraded the outlook for mexico sharply cutting a half point off the estimate to 1 6 percent this year and 1 9 percent in 2020
transcript of the press conference of the april 2019 fiscal monitor speakers vitor gaspar director fiscal affairs department catherine pattillo assistant director fiscal affairs department paolo mauro deputy director fiscal affairs department ting yan communications officer communications department ms yan good morning everyone welcome to this press conference on the fiscal monitor thank you for being with us here today and welcome also to those who are following us online my name is ting yan i am with the communications department let me first introduce our speakers here sitting beside me is mr vitor gaspar director of the fiscal affairs department at the imf to his right are ms catherine pattillo assistant director of the fiscal affairs department and mr paolo mauro deputy director of the fiscal affairs department vitor will give his opening remarks with a short presentation today and then we are happy to take your questions after that with that let me give the floor to vitor mr gaspar thank you good morning welcome and thank you for your interest on the fiscal monitor which has a brand new cover with a brand new color we will be covering the two chapters in the fiscal monitor the first on the current situation and prospects for fiscal policy the second on how to strengthen fiscal institutions to reduce vulnerabilities to corruption as you have heard from the world economic outlook the current economic situation is delicate and the subsequent projected recovery is precarious global economic activity slowed in the second half of 2018 risks are to the downside in response monetary and fiscal policies in many countries have become more expansionary alleviating the slowdown as you just heard in the press conference on the global financial stability report accommodative monetary policies are welcome and have contributed to diminish short run risks on fiscal policy our view is more nuanced country specific circumstances are crucial fiscal policy decision makers should be aware of elevated public debt ratios financial vulnerabilities and downside risks to nominal growth for most countries getting their fiscal houses in order means preparing for the next downturn or financial crisis fiscal policy also needs an upgrade governments would be well advised to pursue smarter and more agile fiscal policies to facilitate change in the face of fast paced technological transformation globalization and demographics sustainable and inclusive growth requires improving tax systems and more and better investment in people and infrastructure public debt levels are significantly higher across all country groups than before the global financial crisis in advanced economies public debt levels have been stable since 2012 however they have continued to rise in emerging market economies and low income developing countries considering the intraservice tax revenue ratios advanced economies have benefitted from historically low interest rates while public debt ratio is highest in advanced economies the interest service ratio is lowest and let s go by country group now declining interest rates to extremely low levels have contributed to the fall in the interest to tax revenue ratio in advanced economies ten year bond yields are now negative in japan and germany that is what you see in the slide and at the top end of the chart you see the u s and italy with bond yields at about two and a half percent nonetheless in advanced economies given the very high level of public debt ratios we would have preferred stronger fiscal adjustment in the past gradual and growth friendly fiscal adjustment for countries with high debt levels is our baseline policy advice in the event of a severe or prolonged downturn if inflation and inflation expectations from target fiscal policy should complement monetary easing in the context of a comprehensive and consistent approach in emerging market economies public debt levels have increased substantially since the beginning of the global financial crisis public debt increased by an average of 15 percentage points of gdp realization of exchange rate and interest rate risk caused public debt levels to rise further in 2018 in several large emerging market economies in some of those countries sovereign spreads fluctuate around an increasing trend in 2018 but spreads have fallen significantly since the beginning of 2019 these wide swings are a reminder of how quickly financing conditions may turn in this environment fiscal restraint is generally recommended nevertheless there are exceptions notably china where limited temporary fiscal expansion facilitating economic rebalancing is part of an overall approach to smooth the slowing down of the economy and now low income developing countries in low income developing country public debt vulnerabilities have increased the number of countries that the imf considers to be at high risk or in debt distress increased by half from 2012 from 16 to 24 at the same time additional spending is required for meeting the sustainable development goals by 2030 and our estimates are at 15 percent of gdp additional spending is even larger at about 20 percent of gdp in sub saharan africa to achieve the sdgs each country needs to have full ownership of its own development strategy strong sustainable and inclusive growth is at the center of the process public and private financing should contribute to make such complementarity work improvements in governance and business environment are desirable in most countries the g20 compact with africa may act as an important catalyst but first and foremost it is decisive to improve tax and state capacity this entails for example broadening the tax base and enhancing tax administration but it is also necessary to improve public financial management transparency and accountability the composition of the budget and public spending efficiency lastly it is necessary to have strong cooperation among all stakeholders including the donor community and now i ask for your attention for a short summary of the chapter on curbing corruption you can think of the government budget as a complicated plumbing system corruption corrodes the pipes in the fiscal house precious financial resources leak out curbing corruption requires enduring political will and sustained reform to institutions and practices curbing corruption is difficult but it brings important benefits the chapter includes many examples let me focus on tax revenues in georgia and rwanda improvements in the fight against corruption helped raise tax revenue by 13 percentage points and six percentage points of gdp respectively within just a few years of major reforms reducing vulnerabilities to corruption requires reforms at home but it also requires international cooperation for example through punishment of foreign bribery and action to curtail opportunities to hide corrupt proceeds abroad before my colleagues and i answer your questions let me just repeat the main takeaways in setting fiscal policy policymakers should be aware of elevated public debt ratios financial vulnerabilities and downside risks to nominal growth for most countries getting their fiscal houses in order means preparing for the next economic downturn or financial crisis fiscal policy also needs an upgrade government would be well advised to pursue smarter and more agile fiscal policies to facilitate change in the face of fast paced technological transformation globalization and demographics thank you for your attention we now welcome your questions ms yan thank you vitor question how close do you think the world is to another developing country debt crisis mr gaspar we do see an increase in the number of countries that we see at high risk or in debt distress that was in one of the slides that i produced the point to retain is that it is crucial to manage these risks in order to make an extreme scenario like the one you have referred to less likely and easier to cope with question brazilian public debt is in an upward trajectory i wonder what do you think about should be brazilian fiscal policy and if there is any room to improve public investment because it is in very low levels and it is always cut year after year mr gaspar so let me answer your question carefully firstly it is important to clarify that our projection for public debt in brazil is predicated on the respect for the constitutional limit on spending that leads to a situation where the cyclically adjusted primary balance is projected to improve by almost half a percentage point of gdp from 2021 onwards under those assumptions in our projection the public debt to gdp ratio will still be on an upward path for brazil and for 2024 the last year of our projection would be at almost 98 percent of gdp at that point in time it would be stabilizing so at that point in time the upward path on the public debt to gdp ratio would be interrupted now in our view given vulnerabilities of the fiscal position in brazil we would welcome a faster pace of adjustment and we would welcome if the debt to gdp ratio would stabilize at an earlier date the gains in credibility of fiscal sustainability in brazil could be an important reward to those efforts at the same time we see room for improvements in fiscal policy in brazil including increases in public spending efficiency and changing priorities so that one could increase the importance of public investment and make space to protect public investment over the business cycle at the same time we also do see room for improvements on the tax side and the possibility of improving for example the value added tax in brazil is something that could give high returns i could be more detailed but i think that qualitatively you have seen where we are going question china rolled out recently a 300 billion tax cut along with an increasing budget deficit could you comment on these measures and especially its impact on the trade offs between supporting growth and controlling its debt levels thanks mr gaspar so as i did say in my introductory remarks the fiscal stimulus in china is justified to smooth the slowdown in economic activity in china and it should help the transition of china to a different growth model that will emphasize much more the quality of growth over firm quantitative objectives on growth the strategy of the chinese authorities has included in the past the reining in of credit growth and the control over the level of leverage in the chinese economy in 2018 that strategy has born fruit when you look at public finances the efforts at controlling debt dynamics in the general government of china has started longer ago i always refer to the public finance law of 2014 and when it comes to the current package of measures what we always say is that there are two principles that are fundamental first the stimulus should be fully on budget and secondly it is very important that the composition of the fiscal measures facilitates the transition to the new growth model one can always make detailed comments here and there for example one remark that we make is that the reduction in the personal income tax if one on the one hand makes sense because it supports consumption on the other hand the reduction in the personal income tax reduces the degree of progressivity of the overall chinese tax system and going forward we see room to increase the progressivity of the chinese tax system question the former economic counselor of the imf olivier blanchard recently said that new thinking was needed in fiscal policy when you have such low interest rates that maybe countries can withstand higher debt levels there has been a new color to the fiscal monitor but we have not seen this sort of thinking reflected in this fiscal monitor do you agree with mr blanchard or do you think that the fund is right to stick to its very conservative attitude to fiscal policy mr gaspar so in terms of the substance i tried in my presentation here today to call the attention to all to the fact that despite the fact that advanced economies have levels of the public debt to gdp ratios which are close to unprecedented in peace time the interest payments associated with the service of that debt are historically low that is true for the aggregate of advanced economies and that is impressively true for many advanced economies and i have seen stories and analyses covering countries as different as japan greece france and the united states so there is an issue of trying to understand the implications of low interest rates and how long can this low interest rates persist what we do know from historical experience and empirical analysis is that financing conditions are volatile and they can change abruptly there is no scarcity of financing crisis some involving advanced economies some involving emerging market economies some involving low income countries so clearly the risks associated with the rollover of high levels of public debt have not gone away and those are the risks that we emphasize in the fiscal monitor the risks that we believe that ministries of finance would be well advised to manage carefully question which is the cause of corruption in latin american and i have other questions which policies ecuador and other countries can replay and what is your advice on the fight against corruption in latin american especially in ecuador if you could say something mr mauro sure so in the chapter of course we look at corruption which is a concern in latin america and on all other continents i am afraid we highlight three results the first one is that we observe the costs of corruption for revenue collection our headline result is that if you compare countries more or less at the same level of economic development those that are less corrupt collect 4 percentage points of gdp more revenues than those that are more corrupt there is also a significant difference in the amount of waste in public investment and again the numbers are macroeconomically relevant and if you look at test scores of school aged students again there is a significant difference which we document in the chapter so this is clearly something which is macroeconomically relevant in latin america and in other regions what can be done about it we have a long list of advice in the report on how governments can renovate their plumbing and improve the situation just to give one example the public investment management assessments of the imf would be one way of having a systematic look at how the efficiency of public investment can be improved that is a topic that comes up very often in latin america question thank you this is a country specific question now sri lanka s growth has slowed down quite significantly during the last few years so with the election this being an election year and the higher debt obligations and rollover risks do you see any fiscal slippage in sri lanka and how feasible is you know aspiring higher growth ms pattillo thank you on the growth issue the economy is stabilizing and indicators point to some improvements in the beginning of 2019 on the fiscal the 2019 budget which was actually just approved by parliament last week in our view strikes a very good balance between the priority of revenue based consolidation while also making space for critical social and capital spending and also business friendly measures that will support private investment and growth on the nexus on the structural which is an important nexus then between fiscal and growth soe reforms then are critical for improving competitiveness and medium term growth over the longer term question i want to ask in arabic i would like to ask about the cost of corruption i would like to ask about the cost of corruption in the middle east specifically and also my question is about jordan in particular jordan now has embarked on certain financial reforms in its law the law regarding the new income tax law and so many reforms under the supervision of the imf in your opinion the new law how will it lessen or mitigate the tax evasion in jordan and if there are certain forecasts regarding the mitigation of this if there is tax evasion and is corruption in the middle east tends more to be administrative or i mean bribes and corruption in a way that is financial specifically mr mauro thank you i am afraid i did not catch the beginning of the question but let me say a couple of things about the macro fiscal aspects and the tax reform that you referred to in jordan and then i will touch on the specific corruption question that you asked about revenue administration and tax policy so jordan of course has a very high debt to gdp ratio of about 95 percent at this time and the main macro fiscal objective now is to bring that debt ratio down we are also aware of course that jordan is under a lot of pressure given the hundreds of thousands of refugees that are in the country so the challenges are very very severe again fiscal consolidation gradually is the priority and in the implementation of the tax reform certainly a priority is to rationalize the tax exemptions the other objective would be to shift the balance of fiscal adjustment away from taxing consumption and toward taxing income which would make the system more progressive another priority would be to take a good look at the finances of the state owned sector that should be consolidated and certainly maintain the operational balance of the electricity company so those would be the macro fiscal priorities on the issue of corruption more generally when tax systems are more complicated that creates scope for discretion on the part of tax administrators so certainly simplification of the tax system is one type of measure that facilitates better revenue administration another way of improving revenue administration in this perspective is to try to eliminate face to face interactions between tax administrators and taxpayers because if you have an electronic system that just makes things much easier in that regard and we show in the paper that the gains from these types of reforms are substantial we have structured exercises that countries can go through just to name one our tadat the tax administration diagnostic assessment tool there are ways of being systematic in looking at what are the priorities in simplifying the system and making it less vulnerable to corruption question hi thank you in the report you suggest that there is room for fiscal space and in a number of countries china australia germany japan south korea i am just wondering if these countries do not take this opportunity they will have a risk of far lower growth rates i am wondering what the source of that risk is is it trade conflicts primarily and what happens in the longer term to their fiscal picture if they do not take this opportunity and they do not enact a stimulus for the near term thanks mr gaspar so the point that we have very much emphasized in the fiscal monitor and in general in our fiscal policy advice is that the advice is country specific the concept of fiscal space is a concept based on the idea that the country has the possibility of expanding the budget by increasing spending or reducing taxes without putting in danger fiscal sustainability or access to bond markets so it is a faculty whether the countries should be using it or not depends on circumstances and it is not a case that the recommendations would be uniform for all the countries that you have listed let me look at one specific example we have been arguing that a more expansionary fiscal policy would be welcome in germany and why is that because from the viewpoint of germany itself giving priority to public investment would be in our view a very good bet because financing costs are very low in the main presentation you just saw that the 10 year bond yield in germany is slightly negative the yield curve is uniformly negative up to 10 years and there are many opportunities for productive investment in infrastructure and networks in germany that could yield a very positive return for the german economy and thereby strengthen potential growth and competitiveness at the same time germany has a very large current account surplus and an expansion of spending in germany that would be directed to infrastructure would help in that dimension as well and that is why we think that expansionary fiscal policy in germany be with the limits of the fiscal space and the prevailing rules would be well advised question this is the election season in india now a lot of political parties are making populist announcement and this is at a time when we have missed the fiscal deficit targets a couple of times at the same time our borrowing is very high states are also borrowing very huge amounts of moneyso what is your view on this kind of borrowing and these kinds of populist measures that will surely push up the deficit widen the deficit even further mr mauro so in the case of india of course the priority continues to be gradual fiscal consolidation because as you know the gross general government to gdp ratio is at about 70 percent so including the states the subnationals that is from a macro fiscal perspective you also have a very rapid growth rate the economy is growing in excess of 7 percent and the objective there is to make sure that that growth is inclusive and it filters down to poverty reduction now when one looks at proposals the important thing is to look at the benefits but also look at the costs and to look at the details certainly when one looks at the case of india there is a lot of scope for reducing untargeted food and fertilizer subsidies and for enhancing revenue administration including for the gst which was a transformational positive reform but again even there improved tax compliance would be a priority on the schemes therefore ultimately what matters is the combined distributional impact of the transfer policies and also of the taxes that would finance them so one has to look at the whole package together to assess the distributional impact question i have two questions the first one the imf has argued that nigeria should increase vat to shore up revenue but that has met resistance from the private sector and the populists so do you have any other techniques that nigeria may use to shore up revenue secondly on a chart in this report the second page second chapter i mean nigeria and qatar are ranked lowest on the use of sovereign wealth funds if i am correct so what do you think nigeria can do better to improve this ranking ms pattillo thank you as you point out tax reform in nigeria is a very important issue and one of our main recommendations for nigeria is the need for a comprehensive tax reform that would sustainably increase non oil revenue and the reason why that is needed is that nigeria has one of the lowest ratios of non oil revenue to gdp at around 3 4 percent in the world and total tax revenue to gdp at around 8 percent is also very low compared to peers because of that then the interest to tax ratio because the tax is so low is high and so a lot of then the tax is crowded out that not being able to be spent on important development needs and does nigeria have those needs of course big time as you know the needs for infrastructure and for spending on human capital are very large you asked about whether there are other areas beside the vat there is an emphasis also on improving excise taxes and i think there have been some steps in that direction but there is scope for expanding the coverage of excises to other goods and also higher rates on excises another important area is aggressive streamlining of tax incentives and exemptions so there has been in nigeria an effort with the strategic revenue growth initiative looking at a comprehensive approach to tax reform and this is very welcome mr mauro just to complement on the importance of transparency of sovereign wealth funds certainly to make sure that the natural resources of countries that have them are channeled appropriately to the people that need those resources and are not wasted ms yan let me take one question online on europe so this is a question from portuguese media the question is in the report the imf mentions the need for a synchronized fiscal response in the euro area in the scenario of a severe downturn is it possible without a euro area budget or fiscal capacity mr gaspar we have been arguing for a number of years that a central fiscal capacity for the euro area would be an important addition to the set of tools that the european policymakers could deploy in particular in the case of a prolonged or severe downturn in economic activity so from that viewpoint the fact that debt is something that is still being discussed at the level of the proposals is not something which is part of the architecture of the euro area is a weakness at the same time we know from experience that the european authorities were able to act in the past in case of a severe downturn we all remember that in 2009 at the time of the global financial crisis the europeans agreed on the european economic recovery plan and that was then implemented by the fiscal authorities of the member countries ms yan thank you i think we have time for one more question in the room question thank you i would like to get back to the curbing of corruption so you have you have done a wonderful job about showing the impact of corruption but i am wondering how you would integrate your findings in your article iv reports or in your programs or at post program monitoring assessments and i am asking this question because in greece for example imf has a 10 year presence there and the corruption is still an issue policies that have been implemented all have been advocated by the imf did not address the problem thank you mr mauro so on corruption as you know the imf has had guidelines in place since 1997 and in 2017 we assessed our implementation of those guidelines and found that we should be more candid more operational and more evenhanded and hence in 2018 the board asked us to do that we are already beginning the implementation of the new framework if you look at our staff reports we are being more candid more vocal more detailed and more operational in the advice just to give some examples of staff reports that have that greater detail kosovo cambodia bolivia angola bulgaria guatemala nigeria panama there is a lot more information that we are working on that is in the surveillance aspects of course in program cases also we are more involved there as well if you look at our chapter you will see that the experience is that improvements in corruption occasionally like in the cases of rwanda or georgia that were given before occasionally it happens in a few years but most cases you see a very gradual improvement it takes a long time it takes a lot of effort a lot of persistence it takes political will and it takes technical changes i think those technical changes are being made and of course that is something that we are going to continue monitoring and that is the effort we also provide countries with detailed advice through our capacity development our diagnostics those are listed in the report and i hope that you will hold us accountable if we are doing that i think we certainly will imf communications department media relations press officer ting yan phone 1 202 623 7100email media imf org ms yan thank you very much this concludes our press conference
washington april 9 2019 afp the global economy is facing a delicate moment beset with risks as the recovery loses steam amid trade tensions brexit and other factors the international monetary fund warned on tuesday the imf s world economic outlook once again downgraded global growth to 3 3 percent for 2019 two tenths lower than the global crisis lender forecast in january and four tenths lower than october and while world growth is expected to pick up in the second half of this year and hit 3 6 percent in 2020 many things will have to go right for that to happen including a resolution of president donald trump s trade battle with china the quarterly report projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a statement but stressed that global recession is not in the baseline the euro area is likely to slow sharply particularly in germany where the gdp forecast was cut by a half point and italy which has slowed to a virtual standstill according to the quarterly report and amid the turmoil over its exit from the european union the imf downgraded the outlook for britain this year and next warning of a severe impact if london crashes out with no agreement emerging economic powers china and india continue to show the highest growth rates 6 3 percent and 7 3 percent respectively beijing has rolled out a series of fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the hit from the us trade war as well as the clampdown on the boom in lending but india s growth was downgraded by two tenths of a point and while the recent signs that officials in washington and beijing are engineering a trade deal have calmed some of the nerves in financial markets the solution is by no means certain the report cautions that downside risks to the outlook continue to dominate trade tensions could flare up again and there is risk of a no deal brexit withdrawal or persistent slowing of economic activity this is a delicate moment for the global economy gopinath said this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies including argentina and turkey she urged policymakers to steer clear of potential pitfalls and warned that if any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries may be derailed given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided she said urging cooperation among governments especially in trade conflicts to avoid fueling uncertainty that could contribute to a slowdown the challenge to policymakers is they have little ammunition with which to counteract a slowdown since interest rates are low and most central banks already have stopped raising or started cutting rates while debt levels are high crimping the ability to provide fiscal stimulus gopinath told reporters there is some room to use monetary policy to support economies as long as inflation remains low but critically a durable resolution of trade uncertainty created by the us and china would be very positive for global growth she said in a press briefing also warning against expanding the dispute to more sectors the broad based slowdown most notably in advanced economies was larger than expected and apparently due to the souring of market sentiment partly due to the trade tensions the imf said trump s aggressive trade policies largely but not exclusively aimed at china left us products open to retaliation in the form of steep tariffs but inflation pressures remained muted despite the new duties which raised the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports trump also has threatened tariffs on european autos and on tuesday said he was prepared to unleash punitive measures against 11 billion in imports including helicopters aircraft parts and gouda cheese over subsidies to aviation giant airbus global trade growth has slowed sharply from its peak in late 2017 and expectations for future business activity have weakened pointing to slowing momentum ahead the imf said growth in advanced economies next year presents a mixed picture the united states and japan are expected to slow further next year with us gdp adding 1 9 percent and japan s just 0 5 percent half of this year s rate but with temporary factors waning germany s growth is projected to accelerate to 1 4 percent and italy to 0 9 percent spain is the strong performer in the euro area with 2 1 percent growth in 2019 and 1 9 percent in 2020 in the major emerging markets china s expansion will slow to 6 1 percent while india continues to accelerate to 7 5 percent the imf downgraded the outlook for mexico sharply cutting a half point off the estimate to 1 6 percent this year and 1 9 percent in 2020

by gita gopinath economic counsellor and director of the research department at the international monetary fund a year ago economic activity was accelerating in almost all regions of the world one year later much has changed the escalation of us china trade tensions needed credit tightening in china macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany and financial tightening alongside the normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half of 2018 with this weakness expected to persist into the first half of 2019 our new world economic outlook weo projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy global growth softened to 3 6 percent in 2018 and is projected to decline further to 3 3 percent in 2019 the downward revision in growth of 0 2 percentage points for 2019 from the january projection is also broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 this pickup is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential the us federal reserve the european central bank the bank of japan and the bank of england have all shifted to a more accommodative stance china has ramped up its fiscal and monetary stimulus to counter the negative effect of trade tariffs furthermore the outlook for usâ china trade tensions has improved as the prospects of a trade agreement take shape these policy responses have helped reverse the tightening of financial conditions to varying degrees across countries emerging markets have experienced some resumption in portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the us dollar while the improvement in financial markets has been rapid those in the real economy have been slow to materialize measures of industrial production and investment remain weak for now in many advanced and emerging market economies and global trade has yet to recover with improved prospects for the second half of 2019 global growth in 2020 is projected to return to 3 6 percent this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies where growth is projected to increase from 4 4 percent in 2019 to 4 8 percent in 2020 specifically it relies on an expected rebound in growth in argentina and turkey and some improvement in a set of other stressed developing economies and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty growth in advanced economies will slow slightly in 2020 despite a partial recovery in the euro area as the impact of us fiscal stimulus fades and growth tends toward the modest potential for the group given aging trends and low productivity growth beyond 2020 global growth is expected to stabilize at around 3â½ percent bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent though with considerable variance as emerging asia continues to grow faster than other regions a similar pattern holds for low income countries with some particularly commodity importers growing rapidly but others falling further behind the advanced world in per capita terms risks to global growth while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks tensions in trade policy could flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains growth in systemic economies such as the euro area and china may surprise on the downside and the risks surrounding brexit remain heightened a deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries including sovereign bank doom loop risks building more inclusive economies given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesnâ t weaken investment fiscal policy will need to manage trade offs between supporting demand protecting social spending and ensuring that public debt remains on a sustainable path with the optimal mix depending on country specific circumstances financial sector policies must address vulnerabilities proactively by deploying macroprudential tools such as counter cyclical capital buffers a task made more urgent by the possibility that interest rates will remain low for longer monetary policy should remain data dependent be well communicated and ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience there is a need for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts to address climate change and risks from cybersecurity and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation this is a delicate moment for the global economy if the downside risks do not materialize and the policy support put in place is effective global growth should rebound if however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed in that case policymakers will need to adjust depending on circumstances this may require synchronized though country specific fiscal stimulus across economies complemented by accommodative monetary policy lastly adequate resources for multilateral institutions remain essential to retain an effective global safety net which would help stabilize the global economy editor s note the summary bullets for this

introduction there is no shortage of difficult cases for conflict prevention around the world but mozambique is a particularly interesting one and could mark a defining moment for the international community s approach to this challenge since its independence from portugal in 1975 mozambique has alternated two long periods of war and peace first a 15 year long civil war between the ruling party the frente de libertação de moçambique frelimo and the rebel forces of the resistência nacional moçambicana renamo which caused over one million deaths and displaced five million people then since the signature of the rome general peace accords in 1992 almost 20 years of peaceful transition to democracy and steady gdp growth averaging 7 between 2003 and 2013 1 just when mozambique was beginning to be regarded as a successful example of post conflict peacebuilding 2 the resurgence of low intensity armed conflict between renamo and frelimo in the period 2013 2016 provided an unexpected reality check revealing the dangers of a flawed democratisation process yet the sources of instability in today s mozambique are no longer limited to the politico military confrontation between renamo and frelimo a dangerous mix of old and new dynamics have been dragging mozambique into a spiral of fragility and violence meanwhile a debt crisis halted the foreign investment bonanza in 2016 as the discovery of undisclosed government loans worth 2 billion3 led to the withdrawal of contributions by the international monetary fund imf and group of 14 budget support donors 4 a drop of 75 in foreign investments a currency crisis and a sharp decline in economic growth which fell from 7 4 in 2014 to 3 4 in 2017 5 finally in early march 2019 cyclone idai swept through mozambique s central provinces destroying entire towns and villages in its path killing hundreds of people and affecting thousands in what the un has described as one of the worst weather related disasters ever to hit the southern hemisphere while the full effects of the humanitarian catastrophe are yet to be determined the world food programme believes that 1 7 million people will need help as a result of the disaster 6 inevitably creating risks for stability against this backdrop what can be done to mitigate conflict risks before it is too late this conflict series brief seeks to provide answers to these questions by telling two stories about stability in mozambique one is about peacebuilding and what factors contributed to a resurgence of the renamo frelimo conflict in 2013 the other one is about conflict prevention looking at what other forms of violence have been unfolding and the measures that might be taken to avoid their escalation as the following sections will show mozambique is no longer an early warning case study the current situation in the country is a wake up call to the international community to take action and a test case for effective conflict prevention requiring changes in the way local actors cooperate so that risks of violent conflict are identified before they translate into a crisis 7 the conclusion outlines how multilateral actors and bilateral donors in particular the european union might accordingly better target their initiatives in order to maximise their impact and effectiveness from civil war to civil peace historical backdrop the mozambican civil war began in 1977 when renamo an armed rebel group supported by rhodesia as it was then and south africa launched a guerrilla campaign against the frelimo government opposing its marxist ideology and policies 8 by the end of the war in 1992 mozambique was on its knees destruction wrought by the war droughts and famine had decimated its natural resources and physical infrastructure large swathes approximately 40 of agricultural communications and administration infrastructure were destroyed and the health care system was severely damaged with dramatic implications for total war related deaths estimated at one million 9 indiscriminate violence during military operations had led to countless human rights violations and large scale massacres like that which took place in the southern village of homoine in 1987 with a death toll of 424 the cessation of armed conflict under the 1992 rome general peace accords relied on a disarmament demobilisation and reintegration ddr process for 90 000 combatants from both renamo and the mozambican armed forces overseen by the united nations operation in mozambique onumoz despite the relative success of the peace agreement and the resulting stability which lasted until the renamo insurgency in 2013 the roots of many persisting political problems in mozambique can be traced to the end of the civil war and the deployment of the onumoz mission and in particular to issues relating to disarmament and decentralisation 10 figure 1 mozambique map and key dates data gadm 2019 natural earth 2019 disarmament was not prioritised in the ddr programme for fear of undermining the peace process given mistrust between the government and the opposition and their reluctance to surrender arms and integrate troops 11 renamo combatants often handed over old weaponry and hid arms caches across the country as an insurance policy it has been suggested that over 20 000 arms may still be in the possession of renamo although the exact number is unknown this allowed renamo to always keep the military option open during peacetime and exploit it for political gain 12 decentralisation was first introduced in the context of the institutional reforms that followed the 1992 peace accords in response to the need to create a political space for renamo the government saw decentralisation as a way of improving relations with the rural population nevertheless the 1994 presidential elections demonstrated the potential threat posed by decentralisation to frelimo as results revealed widespread support for renamo in many rural areas the parliament consequently declared the devolution law unconstitutional in november 1995 and passed a constitutional amendment which created a parallel system of local governance with two levels of administration the provinces and the districts accountable to the central government and the municipalities with devolved autonomous powers competencies and resources this system contributed to the consolidation of frelimo as the country s dominant political force by enhancing the control that the party exerts at the local level 13 thereby paving the way for a return of insurgency back to square one the revival of the renamo insurgency the re establishment of wartime military bases in the gorongosa mountains by renamo leader afonso dhlakama in late 2012 and renamo s attack on a police station in muxungue manica province in april 2013 in retaliation for a police raid on renamo s local headquarters in muxúnguè and gondola were the events that triggered the return of insurgency in mozambique the causes were multiple the shortcomings of an incomplete ddr process generating grievances such as frustration related to the fact that renamo ex combatants were not eligibile for pensions to which former frelimo soldiers were entitled renamo s only partial transition to a political party frelimo s monopoly of political power and authoritarianism and the emergence of a younger post civil war renamo generation believing that the use of force is the only way by which frelimo might be induced to cede power 14 the conflict can be divided into two phases the 2013 2014 insurgency with a ceasefire signed in august 2014 in advance of the october 2014 general elections and the renewed conflict that followed the disputed elections which resulted in filipe nyusi being elected as president and frelimo maintaining majority control of the assembly on 27 december 2016 renamo unexpectedly declared a unilateral truce which was subsequently extended twice before being extended indefinitely in may 2017 peace talks resumed in march 2017 president nyusi announced the creation of a contact group15 to support peace negotiations co chaired by the swiss and american ambassadors including china the european union norway and the high commissioners of botswana and the united kingdom talks between nyusi and dhlakama with the support of the contact group led to a decentralisation agreement incorporating constitutional amendments 16 allowing for the indirect election of mayors provincial governors and district administrators and to the signature of a memorandum of understanding on military affairs allowing for the launch of a second ddr process 17 in view of the upcoming october 2019 presidential elections both parties are now interested in securing a peace agreement frelimo perceives a successful peace process as being to its own electoral advantage even though it remains reluctant to give up power renamo despite the failure of the post civil war ddr is confronted with a base eager to participate in the political process with more or less open rent seeking objectives 18 an important feature of the peace process is the fact that negotiations were conducted at the highest political level through a dialogue between nyusi and dhlakama that excluded members of their respective parties this made it easier to finalise agreements and avoid exacerbating tensions however especially after the sudden death of dhlakama on 3 may 2018 a key challenge going forward will be how to turn a top down exclusive approach into an inclusive sustainable process that includes the base of both parties 19 renamo s new president ossufo momade elected on 17 january 2019 will have the responsibility to oversee this complex process this will be neither an easy nor a painless task on the one hand momade is seen as a voice of moderation and reconciliation and as the right person to support a political transition for renamo on the other hand he will have to take into account the implications of the october 2018 municipal elections during which renamo s electoral successes in 8 municipalities were overshadowed by blatant irregularities in many other municipalities particularly in marromeu 20 setting a precedent for potential widespread fraud in the next elections a fraudulent electoral process is indicative of the peace process not being inclusive as it shows that mistrust still reigns among the political parties weakening public support for frelimo aggravates internal cleavages too many concessions to renamo may entail a loss of rents and privileges which makes the party apparatus prone to resort to fraudulent practices to maintain its position renamo is tempted by the political transition but afraid that a corrupt system will prevent it from obtaining a legitimate victory against this backdrop the political agenda in 2019 will be dominated by the elections the political transition within renamo under the new leadership and the attempts to sign a permanent peace agreement before mozambicans head to the polls in a climate of mistrust a peace agreement on paper without concrete measures to implement ddr and create trust between the parties would significantly increase the likelihood of a relapse into violence especially during after the elections 21 the situation could deteriorate further as new threats to stability are emerging beyond the confrontation between the two parties the rise of violent extremism in cabo delgado since the october 2017 attacks on three police stations in mocimboa de praia 150 fatalities were reported in both battles and violence against civilians in the province between 1 october 2017 and 30 june 2018 at least half of these occurred between 15 may and 30 june 2018 22 little is known about the group responsible research23 suggests that there are between 350 and 1 000 militants organised in cell based structures with each cell comprising 10 20 individuals using basic weaponry and tactics these cells operate relatively autonomously have flexible chains of command and follow their own strategy in areas under their control members of the group are recruited directly through family networks friends or in mosques or have been recruited indirectly through video propaganda used by radical movements in kenya and tanzania which has been spread in mocímboa da praia and surrounding districts 24 figure 2 cabo delgado province data gadm 2019 natural earth 2019 despite uncertainty about the origins motivations and support base of the insurgents three main debates have emerged the first debate is between alarmists who fear the emergence of a new boko haram and those who caution against securitising the insurgency in cabo delgado in relation to this debate the government has alternated between expressing alarm and seeking to minimise the threat in several instances it downplayed the islamist insurgency as the work of a few criminal individuals however president nyusi warned the united nations general assembly on 26 september 2018 that the groups of malefactors in cabo delgado will tend to spread to neighbouring countries in the absence of international cooperation 25 moreover mozambique entered into security agreements with tanzania the democratic republic of the congo drc and uganda set up a regional military command moved more troops into the north 26 and passed an anti terrorism law in april introducing heavier sentences the government also closed and destroyed mosques 27 and arrested hundreds of people in response to the attacks including 189 islamist suspects currently standing trial these measures have prompted experts to warn against the danger of alienating the muslim population approximately 18 of the total population mostly sunni and concentrated in the north or overreacting thereby creating incentives for individuals to join extremist groups 28 and bringing about a situation comparable to that which led to the rise of boko haram in nigeria 29 the second debate pertains to the local drivers of the islamist insurgency and the motives of those who have joined militant groups whether due to socio economic grievances or more political and ideological motives poverty unemployment social exclusion and lack of access to basic services education and healthcare have been identified as key drivers of youth radicalisation in cabo delgado as well as the mwani people s feelings of resentment towards the makonde 30 the third debate concerns the extent to which the insurgency is domestically rooted or the result of transnational jihadism spreading south given that the centre of gravity for violent extremism in east africa is extending from somalia southward to kenya as demonstrated by the westgate garissa and dusitd2 attacks and with tanzania now as an emerging theatre 31 although insurgents in cabo delgado are locally designated as al shabaab there are no signs that they are directly affiliated to the somali extremist group which has not made any public statement or claimed any attacks in cabo delgado that said much of the leadership of the insurgents in cabo delgado allegedly has links with the religious circles of radical islamist groups in tanzania somalia kenya and the great lakes as well as involvement in their commercial and military activities 32 localised and multifaceted violence mozambique is also witnessing an increase in multi layered localised violence manifest in different forms and characterised by different narratives and actors but sharing the common denominator of struggle against state authorities rumours of vampirism in niassa and zambezia provinces have led to violence with local institutions and representatives of the state being attacked because they are believed to be part of a sect of bloodsuckers preying on the people riots sparked by rumours of vampirism occurred in october 2017 in the gilé district capital in the zambezia province and spread to neighbouring cities 33 the alienation of the country s marginalised and disenfranchised youth is an incubator for violence in mozambique young mozambicans 45 of the mozambican population is under 15 years old while one third of the total population is aged between 15 35 years old living in rural areas are increasingly alienated from their own cultural roots and traditions while exposed to trends and images emanating from other parts of the world dangling the prospect of a better future before them this leads to profound frustration among these young people and increases their sense of marginalisation and powerlessness leading them to resort to violence and organised crime in the niassa reserve and the limpopo national park young people earn their livelihood by engaging in illicit cross border trade in rhino horn driven by hunger and lack of money 34 urban youths are also inclined to engage in violence against the state which they see as responsible for their social and economic distress 35 recent data on economic and social transformation make bleak reading 60 of mozambicans were living on less than one dollar a day in 2018 26 cuts in welfare expenditure combined with large chunks of the public budget allocated to defence spending and debt servicing in the planos economicos e sociais since 2015 have been widely criticised by civil society the number of people entering the labour market each year is higher than the number of job opportunities available and the unemployment rate in 2018 was 24 91 27 the divide between urban and rural areas is also widening especially in terms of service delivery whereas in urban areas 80 of mozambicans enjoy access to safe drinking water only 35 of people in the countryside do in terms of access to sanitation facilities a similar divide may be observed between urban with a 44 increase since 1990 and rural 11 communities 38 the potential for violence in civil society and especially among young people is fomenting instability in mozambique which is now further exacerbated by the exploitation of natural resources in the north of the country the elephants in the room natural gas and rubies the north of mozambique has become the epicentre for foreign direct investment as companies vie to extract its wealth of untapped natural resources the discovery in 2010 of one of the world s largest concentrations of natural gas has meant that resource extraction is now at the heart of mozambique s economic development but also poses challenges as to how these revenues expected from 2021 onwards are going to be used by whom and with what risks in terms of competition among political and ethnic groups the international energy association iea estimates that mozambique possesses 3 trillion cubic metres in natural gas reserves located primarily in the rovuma basin area prompting 100 billion investments by foreign companies inter alia eni anadarko and shell and potentially making the country the third largest exporter of liquefied natural gas lng in the world similarly the discovery of the world s largest ruby deposits in the montepuez district in cabo delgado in 2009 had major repercussions for the world s ruby market mozambique now accounts for 80 of the world s ruby production the montepuez ruby mining company in which gemsfield owns a 75 stake which was granted a concession covering an area of 340 km2 has earned over 400 million from international auctions since starting its operations in 2012 the risks for conflict posed by the exploitation of natural resources unfold in many ways 39 the most salient one is the threat the insurgents may pose to the lng investments off the coast in addition there is a danger that the country s natural gas revenues may be siphoned off by corruption and mismanagement thereby causing rising poverty and inequality preventing growth from trickling down to the poorest communities hence exacerbating social tensions 40 rubies are also a dangerous business in the past five years more than half the revenue pouring into the state coffers in the province of cabo delgado came from taxes associated with exploitation of the ruby fields small producers and artisanal miners make up 90 of the industry and since the discovery of the ruby fields nearly 10 000 people have come to northern mozambique digging and trading rubies or offering goods and services to those doing the mining 41 mozambique s ruby industry is now set to boom further as fura gems acquired licences between 2017 and 2018 for exploring up to 1 100 km2 in montepuez and the chiure district of cabo delgado there is a risk that claims of human rights violations associated with multinational corporations could create grievances among the local population making artisanal miners vulnerable to recruitment by islamic insurgents members of the cabo delgado insurgency have reportedly become involved in the illegal mining trade and in smuggling of licit and illicit goods unlike the lng gas industry gems can be extracted locally and insurgents can thus more easily forge links with existing criminal networks 42 preventing conflict in mozambique what can be done mozambique has experienced a shift in conflict dynamics from the long standing confrontation between renamo and frelimo to a more complex constellation of multifaceted and localised violence against the backdrop of changing macro economic risks a widening rift between elites and the population and new security threats which introduce new layers of destabilisation because of the scale and implications of these transformations a pivot to conflict prevention in foreign assistance is recommended what can international actors do to prevent the situation from deteriorating and to foster positive transformation first it is important to realise that the prevention window will not remain open indefinitely timely action is of the essence a pivot to prevention in mozambique may lead to quickly re orienting or adjusting international support towards more targeted conflict prevention objectives this reorientation will need to balance the need for conflict sensitivity with the imperative of effective and timely interventions for short term relief and long term recovery in the areas hit by cyclone idai mismanaged or sluggish post disaster recovery efforts combined with pre existing social grievances would create a storm after the storm scenario in mozambique exacerbating conflict drivers in addition to effective disaster risk management and resilience initiatives which go beyond the scope of this article a three pronged approach can help maintain stability in mozambique in the short term strengthened electoral support could be provided ahead of the october 2019 general elections electoral fraud in marromeu fuelled mistrust between frelimo and renamo and alerted the international community to the possibility of larger scale fraud and political violence during the presidential elections indicating a need to step up long term electoral support without concrete measures to rebuild trust between the two parties especially on ddr the likelihood of a relapse into violence during and after the election will increase multilateral actors and bilateral donors could beef up engagement in the full electoral cycle beyond targeted election monitoring stepping up commitment and conveying political messages to leaders to ensure the transparency and integrity of the electoral process avoid violent mobilisation and any escalation of rhetoric in the electoral debate so as to prevent contestation and the eruption of violence on and after election day the credibility of electoral processes is critical for the future of the peace process as the results of the elections and the way in which the polls are conducted in mozambique will influence the sustainability of the peace agreement also given the fact that this will be the first practical test for the 2018 constitutional amendments in the medium term an emphasis on conflict sensitivity and a more selective approach to investing in critical development projects could lead donors to target those areas where assistance can have most impact in preventing conflict the eu is a case in point being one of the leading aid donors in mozambique where eu institutions and the member states combined provided 570 million out of 1 532 million in 2016 the 11th european development fund edf national indicative programme for mozambique 2014 2020 amounts to 734 million 43 it prioritises rural development in the zambezia and nampula provinces 325 million and good governance and development 367 million nearly half of the envelope 300 million is general budget support but disbursements ceased following the illicit loans scandal in 2016 a prevention approach could identify sectors and geographical areas where assistance can produce immediate results in addressing social grievances three eu projects in cabo delgado financed through the development cooperation instruments and amounting to approximately 2 4 million go some way towards this by supporting civil society and local authorities to play a bigger role in development strategies addressing the needs of the artisanal mining communities could in fact mitigate the risks of conflict and mobilisation as long as the instruments are reoriented towards a specific approach aimed at preventing violent extremism by expanding communities access to licit economic opportunities another area where action is crucial is vis à vis the youth of the country as this brief has shown discontent is rife among mozambique s young people particularly those living in rural areas and in the peripheries of urban centres with many on the point of rebellion development assistance could prioritise projects addressing the integration of mozambican youth into a sustainable social and economic growth path reducing the sense of alienation and powerlessness that drives violence promoting cultural activities for young people in urban areas for instance can help recreate a sense of purpose and mitigate the risk of them becoming involved in illicit trafficking and urban violence and provide them with an incentive and role in building a new society in the long term foreign trade and political influence may support top down wealth redistribution inclusivity and the fight against inequality in mozambique this is particularly important in view of the gas boom mozambique s extractive driven economy has the potential to bring greater prosperity to the country allowing for expansionary macroeconomic policies with catalytic effects on the growth of the services sector hence contributing to the reduction of the poverty rate at the same time economic growth has fostered greater inequality between rich and poor urban and rural areas and the south and north of mozambique and the country still ranks among the most unequal ones in sub saharan africa 44 it thus cannot be assumed that the exploitation of mozambique s natural resources will inevitably or automatically bring prosperity and stability the latter outcome will depend on how efficiently the central government commits to implement wealth redistribution and the support the international community and the eu can provide to mitigate four risks i the adverse effects of an extractive driven economy on macroeconomic stability especially in the absence of effective fiscal management ii the potential role of extractive industries as a source of direct or indirect financing for the islamist insurgency iii grievances triggered by unmet expectations concerning natural resource windfalls especially insofar as the absence of job creation and economic opportunities may be exploited by extremist groups for recruitment iv the impact of the extractive industry on the political settlement in the country as rent opportunities will likely affect the distribution of power within and outside the ruling elite as a major political and trade actor in mozambique 45 the eu s contribution to risk mitigation and support to the government can be significant for instance by scaling up assistance on fiscal management and wealth redistribution in conflict prevention failure is far easier to measure then success actors have few political rewards for implementing a good conflict prevention strategy and must face very high transaction costs to sustain robust multilateral initiatives 46 despite the lack of incentives the international community is increasingly acknowledging the impact of prevention in securing long term gains in this regard mozambique is a test case for renewed international thinking and focus on conflict prevention failure would turn the country into a hotspot of instability whereas success could usher in a second era of shared prosperity potentially creating a model for sustainable resilience and peace maintenance references the brief was written with research assistance

karachi the international monetary fund imf on tuesday trimmed pakistan s growth forecast to 2 9 percent in 2019 and 2 8 percent in 2020 amid ongoing macroeconomic adjustment challenges saying twin deficits warrant further structural reforms the country s growth stalled in the current fiscal year as external account sector weakened while revenue expenditure gap continues to widen the current account and fiscal deficits are expected to bring the growth down from a decade high of 5 2 percent in the last fiscal year of 2017 18 in pakistan in the absence of further adjustment policies growth is projected to remain subdued at about 2 5 percent with continued external and fiscal imbalances weighing on confidence the imf said in its world economic outlook before its spring meetings in washington this month the country is in talks with the washington based lender for its 13th economic assistance program since the late 1980s the projections came close on the heels of fragile growth forecasts by the asian development bank and the world bank both the international financial institutions projected real gross development product at 3 4 to 3 9 percent in the current fiscal year as the measures to bring the economy on track are expected to take toll on growth the central bank raised its key policy rate by a cumulative 500 basis points to 10 75 percent since january 2017 rupee that lost a quarter of its value against the dollar over a year kept consumer inflation on the upward trajectory and in march alone annual consumer inflation reached more than five years high of 9 41 percent the imf projected consumer inflation at 7 6 percent in 2019 and 7 percent in 2020 compared with 3 9 percent in 2018 the imf however expected current account deficit to narrow at 5 2 percent in 2019 and 4 3 percent in 2020 as opposed to 6 1 percent in 2018 while finance minister asad umar said the economy has come back to stabilisation mode with foreign inflows of more than three billion dollar replenishing the country s foreign exchange reserves he said the country is still facing challenges including stalled investment and narrow tax base the minister recently said the country is weeks away from securing an imf bailout and hoped an agreement would be reached with the fund by late april or first half of may for a package of anywhere between 6 billion to 12 billion the government has been criticised for taking months to close an imf bailout its second since it secured a 6 6bn loan from the international body in 2013 as the country wrestles with a severe balance of payments crisis the imf further kept projection for unemployment rate unchanged at 6 1 percent in 2019 compared with the previous year and ratcheted it up to 6 2 percent in 2020 the imf too remained pessimistic over pakistan s growth forecast in the medium term as the fund projected growth at 2 5 percent in 2024 consumer inflation was projected at five percent and current account deficit at 5 4 percent in 2024 the imf foresaw deceleration in growth in the region to 1 5 percent in 2019 before recovering to about 3 2 percent in 2020 the medium term outlook for the middle east north africa afghanistan and pakistan region is largely shaped by the outlook for fuel prices needed adjustment to correct macroeconomic imbalances in certain economies and geopolitical tensions it said in the report world economic outlook growth slowdown precarious recovery
after a disappointing 2018 u s stock markets bounced back in january 2019 leading to impressive gains for each of the three major stock indexes in the first quarter however volatility seems to have

uchenne uwaleke in its second bi monthly meeting held on march 25 and 26 this year the monetary policy committee of the central bank of nigeria delivered a pleasant surprise in the form of a minor cut to the monetary policy rate from 14 per cent to 13 5 per cent it was the first time the mpr would be tinkered with since july 2016 the mpc points to the relative stability in the key macroeconomic variables as well as the need to signal a new direction that is pro growth as justification for the 50 basis point reduction specifically the committee was emboldened by the continued moderation in inflationary pressure and the stability in the foreign exchange market although still in breach of the cbn s upper band target of 9 per cent headline inflation slowed to 11 31 percent in february 2019 from a peak of 18 72 in january 2017 according to the national bureau of statistics on the external front the mpc equally found solace in the moderate improvement in crude oil prices and stable accretion to external reserves especially against the backdrop of current developments in the oil futures market which indicate that oil prices will remain considerably above the federal government s 2019 budget benchmark equally heartwarming for the monetary authority is the trend of declining long term yields in the united states of america in the wake of the federal reserve s shift to a more dovish stance and the likelihood that capital flows in the medium term may be redirected to frontier and emerging markets including nigeria without any doubt this move by the mpc bodes well for the nigerian economy which requires a great deal of real sector traction to achieve full recovery and inclusive growth typically as the mpr which is the rate at which banks borrow money from the cbn is reduced the banks in turn are expected to pass on the benefits to customers by reducing interest rates on loans admittedly a 50 basis point reduction may not be significant to translate to lower lending rates in the near term explaining in part why financial markets reaction to the surprise rate cut seemed subdued the equities market for instance closed in the red with the all share index shedding 0 67 per cent on wednesday being the first trading day following the announcement of the rate cut and only managed to eke out a gain of 0 01 per cent at the close of trading the following day nevertheless the mpc decision has opened the door which seemed shut for about 33 months to subsequent rate cuts in the medium term going forward against the backdrop of benign inflation an accommodative monetary policy will provide room for increased channeling of credit to the real sector thereby reducing the cost of funds for many small and medium enterprises the capital market stands to benefit from a low interest rate environment given that some of the increased liquidity will likely flow into the equities market it will also be positive for the government s fiscal position arising from cheaper bonds issuance considering that part of this year s budget deficit will be financed through borrowing from the domestic capital market it goes without saying that a dovish monetary policy stance is only enabled by low inflation and on this score the fiscal authorities equally have a role to play this is consistent with the fiscal theory of price level which postulates that the price level is primarily determined by government debt and fiscal policy with monetary policy playing an indirect role contrary to the monetarist view that considers money supply as the primary determinant of inflation the monthly consumer price index reports by the nbs which identify structural factors as the primary drivers of inflation in nigeria would appear to lend credence to this theory this fact is also acknowledged by the mpc which had noted in its latest communiqué that the upside risks to inflation are chiefly due to factors outside the ambit of monetary policy some of these factors highlighted by the committee include the high cost of energy infrastructure constraints insecurity in some parts of the country and anticipated increase in liquidity from the late implementation of the 2018 budget hence it is vital not to downplay the influence of fiscal policy on price level and within the framework of the ftpl harp on the need for greater fiscal monetary co ordination in order to tackle inflation and foster inclusive growth it is for this reason that the federal government is called upon to sustain its current effort aimed at stimulating output growth by executing the policies contained in the economic recovery and growth plan including through addressing the problem of weak power infrastructure as well as tackling the menace of smuggling and dumping of goods into the country in a bid to accelerate domestic production and create employment opportunities as noted by the mpc part of the complementary measures expected of the government also include the speedy passage of the other aspects of the petroleum industry bill to fast track the development of the value chain in the sector as well as the implementation of the new national minimum wage nonetheless it must be pointed out that if a new minimum wage can only be implemented by increasing taxes such as the value added tax then it simply amounts to digging a hole to fill a new one as the associated spike in the cost of goods and services will erode the purchasing power of any upward adjustment to the wage floor therefore any increase in vat can be productive only if it is part of a broad fiscal strategy of rebalancing the tax mix in favour of consumption tax which will entail also lowering the company income tax doing otherwise in an economy that is still grappling with double digit inflation weak growth and high unemployment rate will cause more distortions and jeopardise on going efforts at restoring sustainable economic growth the cbn projects gdp growth rate of 2 74 per cent for nigeria in 2019 higher than the 2 0 per cent and 2 2 per cent recent projections by the imf and the world bank respectively given that the economy expanded by 1 9 per cent in 2018 the cbn s optimistic projection can only materialise following the effective implementation of the capital component of the budget with emphasis on the employment elastic sectors of the economy regrettably the implementation of annual budgets particularly the capital aspect has over the years been challenged by absence of timely passage and of matching funds while recurrent and statutory obligations such as loan repayments always get fully implemented to this end no stone should be left unturned in getting the fiscal plan ready for implementation as the quick passage of the 2019 budget would reduce uncertainties in the business environment and boost investors confidence in particular the cooperation of the national assembly is required regarding the speedy approval of any government borrowing programme linked to funding the capital component of the budget further the ministry of finance should ensure that funds are released on time and together with the ministry of budget and national planning put in place appropriate mechanisms for budget monitoring and evaluation as the mpc rightly noted the government can also help reduce the non performing loans portfolio of the banking industry and stabilise the banking system by expediting action in settling all outstanding contractor related arrears now that the apex bank appears to have signalled its readiness to change the monetary policy stance from tightening to calibrated easing in support of output growth and employment generation it behoves the fiscal authorities to extend the much desired handshake through well targeted complementary measures copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published broadcast rewritten or redistributed in

because it overlooked the crucial role competition plays curbing misconduct writes senior reporter james eyers advertisement wynn came and went like a mirage in the las vegas desert but there are good reasons why it could come back for crown resorts says chanticleer columnist tony boyd united states federal reserve policymakers debated how to manage the us central bank s massive holding of bonds while agreeing to be patient about any changes to interest rate policy according to the minutes from their march 19 20 meeting the minutes released early thursday morning aest show the fed saw the us economy weathering a global economic slowdown and policymakers made clear they saw no recession for the united states in the new few years but some policymakers said they could change their minds on whether the fed s next move should be to raise or lower rates several participants noted that their views of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate could shift in either direction based on incoming data according to the minutes advertisement while policymakers noted that the us labour market appeared strong some expressed concern about weakness and said a deterioration in the us economy could be amplified by large debt burdens at american companies according to the minutes financial market reaction to the release of march s meeting minutes was largely muted us stocks pared their gains and treasury yields drifted up from the day s low the dollar edged up against the euro the fed took a sharply less aggressive policy posture at its march policy meeting signaling it will not hike rates this year amid a slowing economy and announcing a plan to end its balance sheet reduction program by september a significant portion of the policymakers discussion outlined in the minutes was devoted to how to wind down the fed s balance sheet and how to manage it when that process is over some policymakers suggested the fed should discuss the costs and benefits of new tools for reducing demand for reserves parked at the us central bank according to the minutes the discussion also included comments by several policymakers that the fed might need to stabilize the level of reserves soon after it finishes its balance sheet runoff that would involve resuming the purchase of us treasury securities according to the minutes advertisement seperately us treasury secretary steven mnuchin said he believed former pizza mogul herman cain should be appointed to the federal reserve board president donald trump has recommended mr cain for the post but has not yet formally recommended him europe ecb president mario draghi raised the prospect of more support for the struggling euro zone economy if its slowdown persisted saying the central bank had plenty of instruments with which to react the european central bank has already pushed back its first post crisis interest rate hike but with weak external demand taking a toll on export powerhouse germany it is coming under pressure to do more to support the bloc albeit with a depleted policy toolbox highlighting the loss of economic momentum overnight draghi said the ecb would price a new series of two year loans to banks in such a way as to ensure that credit would keep flowing to the economy it would also consider measures to mitigate the impact on banks of its negative deposit rate taken by observers as a reference to a tiered system exempting lenders from paying a charge on some of their idle cash advertisement but draghi who steps down in october said it was too early to act and deferred any decisions to june we started a process where we will analyse all measures draghi told a news conference after the bank kept policy unchanged as widely expected we need further information that will come to us between now and june the international monetary fund this week said the global economy was slowing more than expected and a sharp downturn could require world leaders to coordinate stimulus but one problem is that after pushing borrowing costs to record lows and taking 2 6 trillion euro worth of bonds out of the market to revive inflation the ecb s options are limited but draghi insisted the ecb had plenty of options we have shown we have plenty of instruments draghi said the market reaction demonstrated that markets have fully understood our reaction function advertisement commodities venezuela s oil output sank to a new long term low last month due to us sanctions and blackouts the country told opec deepening the impact of a global production curb and further tightening supplies supply cuts by opec and partners led by russia plus involuntary reductions in venezuela and iran have helped drive a 32 per cent rally in crude prices this year prompting pressure from us president donald trump for the group to ease its market supporting efforts in a monthly report released overnight the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries said venezuela told the group that it pumped 960 000 barrels per day bpd in march a drop of almost 500 000 bpd from february the figures could add to a debate within the so called opec group of producers on whether to maintain oil supply cuts beyond june a russian official indicated this week moscow wanted to pump more although opec has been saying the curbs must remain opec russia and other non member producers are reducing output by 1 2 million bpd from january 1 for six months the producers are due to meet on june 25 26 to decide whether to extend the pact advertisement opec s report said the economic backdrop was weakening and lowered its estimate of global growth in demand by 30 000 bpd to 1 21 million bpd newly available data has confirmed the recently observed downward trend in global economic activities the report said in a development that will ease opec concern about a new glut the report also said inventories in developed economies fell in february after rising in january stocks in

are trade wars good and easy to win as president donald trump put it last year most mainstream economists and foreign policy analysts answer with a resounding no citing dire analogies such as the great depression and pearl harbor they denounce trump s trade policy as ignorant toward the principles of free trade economics and fraught with security risks both the united states and china will lose critics warn yet a more thorough review of the historical record reveals a winning playbook for the white house provided that it devises clear limited aims it deems achievable through targeted measures and negotiations and avoids presenting china s leadership with a binary choice of absolute humiliating surrender or forceful even violent retaliation the american smoot hawley tariff act of 1930 has become the default worst case analogy for macroeconomic analysts much as the munich agreement has become for security analysts a protectionist wave unleashed by the devastating 1929 u s stock market crash paved the way for smoot hawley s passage into american law the resulting trade war reduced world trade by 66 percent between 1929 and 1934 global economic conditions rapidly deteriorated and the political fortunes of dangerous populist nationalist and even fascist leaders rose another distressing example of a trade war gone disastrously wrong comes from the cascade of events that led to the pearl harbor attack of 1941 to punish japan for its military aggression against its neighbors in the 1930s the united states imposed an embargo on exports of high grade scrap iron and aviation fuel to japan when these measures failed to stop japan s aggression washington ratcheted up its embargo to include essential raw materials such as iron brass copper and fatefully oil faced with a threatening military competitor and a collapsing asian security order these measures appeared to represent a relatively safe way to punish and deter japan but the august 1941 oil embargo proved to be the proverbial last straw eighty percent of japan s oil came from the united states without understanding what it had done the franklin roosevelt administration essentially forced japan to choose between capitulation and conflict backed into a corner japan s ambassador told washington on december 2 1941 the japanese people believe that they are being placed under severe pressure by the united states to yield to the american position and that it is preferable to fight rather than to yield to pressure back in tokyo desperate japanese leaders approved a plan to deliver a preemptive knockout blow at the american naval base at pearl harbor a trade war thus brought america into world war ii however the 1930s should not be policymakers only analogy trade wars do not necessarily result in hot wars as the more recent history of trade conflicts suggest the possibility of other even positive outcomes in august 1971 u s president richard nixon found his country under pressure from foreign central banks and displeased with a trade deficit stemming from the high cost of u s exports as journalist roger lowenstein notes then treasury secretary john connally saw these various financial trials inflation the pressure on the dollar the mounting trade deficit as affronts to the national honor in response nixon abruptly ended the u s dollar s convertibility to gold jeopardizing the entire postwar bretton woods global monetary system simultaneously he instituted a 90 day freeze on wages and prices and placed a 10 percent surcharge on imports to make certain that american products will not be at a disadvantage because of unfair exchange rates like trump nixon took these steps without informing u s allies and risked retaliatory measures sparking a global outcry as happened during what became known as the nixon shock economists today label the trump administration s policies as bad economics not recognizing the politics involved that preoccupy policymakers as lowenstein puts it conomics didn t matter to connally what counted was a forceful display of power even the new york times editorial board quite unlike today in response to trump praised nixon s new economic policy writing we unhesitatingly applaud the boldness with which the president has moved on all economic fronts today as the scholar edward alden argues the united states is less dominant economically than it was in 1971 u s allies are less prepared to accept the legitimacy of president trump s complaints and the trump team is far less competent and experienced than were nixon s advisers who included paul volcker pete peterson robert hormats and henry kissinger not to mention the fact that nixon s abandonment of gold convertibility most likely played a role in causing the soaring inflation of the later 1970s yet in both episodes the president was obsessed with righting america s trade balance and trump s trade actions today could yield results not wholly dissimilar from those produced in 1971 back then with the u s dollar as the world s reserve currency foreign parties chose not to risk long term escalation instead opting to negotiate with the nixon administration this soon led to the december 1971 smithsonian agreement which shifted exchange rates in america s favor while today s exchange rates are not fixed and thus cannot be as easily adjusted other concessions on trade could be garnered to boost u s exports the smithsonian agreement failed to remedy all of nixon s grievances and indeed the entire bretton woods system collapsed soon afterwards but no less a thinker than the future legendary federal reserve chairman paul volcker who was undersecretary of the treasury for monetary affairs under nixon supported the rash step telling an interviewer in 2000 that nixon s ending of the bretton woods system was a necessary transitional step and the strategy proved popular at home just over a decade later concerns over japanese monetary and industrial policy and a ballooning trade deficit prompted the ronald reagan administration to take concrete actions targeting japan using section 301 of the u s trade act of 1974 to place tariffs on japanese imports the same measure used against china today and as with the trump administration regarding the chinese telecommunications company zte last year the united states cited national security concerns with toshiba in defiance of u s sanctions zte sold military grade equipment to iran and north korea toshiba had violated previous agreements with the united states by selling technology to the soviet union that was useful for its production of advanced submarines japan caved to the pressure as u s negotiators secured the multilateral plaza accord of 1985 which devalued the dollar against the yen and rendered u s exports to japan dramatically more competitive the u s congress then went further in 1987 imposing import restrictions on japanese electronics including toshiba products in response tokyo agreed to measures designed to reduce japanese exports of steel and cars to the u s market increase u s imports to japan and eliminate barriers to entry for american companies in japan what trump can learn from his fellow republican predecessors is that white house initiated trade wars do not automatically end in disaster aggressive trade measures can compel opposing parties to provide real concessions and even put the global economic system on more sustainable footing the plaza accord coincided with the negotiations that led to the creation of the world trade organization a major win for an open and rules based global economic order it is thus not out of the question that trump s tariffs on chinese imports could result in substantive wins for the u s economy in the form of increased chinese purchases of american exports the ban of forced technology transfers and stronger chinese intellectual property laws nixon and reagan s experiences illustrate this possibility yet also demonstrate the limited nature of trade wars upside in neither case did the united states receive everything it wanted even aggressive action could not completely alter supposedly unfair economic relationships that u s policymakers sought to redefine as trade deficits persisted the trump administration can learn from the recent history of trade conflict by acknowledging that bold unilateral action does not present some novel threat to the rules based order it has plenty of precedent in an arena where countries seek to both ensure mutual benefit and secure individual advantage at the same time trump is unlikely to get the easy victory he seeks at best he will arrive at a marginally improved outcome determined not by bluster but by strategic serious negotiations yet u s china trade cannot easily be isolated from the growing national security concerns that a broad and bipartisan group in washington has set forth regarding china economics does not receive an exemption from the threatening dynamics of geopolitical competition finally trump and his advisers should understand the need to devise clear limited aims that they deem achievable through targeted measures and negotiations they should identify and choose policies sharp enough to produce concessions but restrained enough to avoid presenting the chinese leadership with a binary choice of face losing surrender or vicious retaliation if the trump administration instead goes after a symbolic total victory america may find itself forced to accept an embarrassing defeat arjun kapur is a schwarzman scholar at

in october 2018 bahrain launched its fiscal balance program aiming to achieve a balanced budget by the end of 2022 with the assistance of three gulf partners kuwait saudi arabia and the united arab emirates many natural resource dependent countries including those in the gulf have tried to restructure government finances in the wake of falling commodity prices with little success however various indicators suggest that bahrain s current efforts are likely to bear fruit in 2017 bahrain s budget deficit was 1 3 billion bahraini dinars 3 5 billion which was over 10 percent of gross domestic product and by the first half of 2018 its public debt was 87 percent of gdp the fiscal balance program s primary goal is to reduce the budget deficit by 800 million bahraini dinars 2 1 billion and to decrease the national debt to 82 percent of gdp over the next four years it aims to achieve these goals via six initiatives the first is an effort to centralize government expenditure decisions six domain specific taskforces will support a supraministerial committee that has to approve the expenditure requests of ministries and other governmental organizations the hope is that the restructuring will lead to a harmonized adoption of best practices and the exploitation of economies of scale the second is a large scale voluntary retirement scheme for government employees which will lead to the elimination of almost 10 000 public sector jobs by the end of 2019 by placing strict constraints on the ability of governmental organizations to rehire as they replace the outgoing personnel the government hopes to realize significant savings by reducing recurrent expenditure moreover it bears the corollary benefit of making high quality civil servants often those most likely to seize the opportunity for early retirement available to contribute to the private sector which is a central component of bahrain s economic vision 2030 the third is the balancing of the electricity and water authority s expenditure and revenue by continuing to roll back subsidies to basic commodities such as power and water the reforms introduced since 2014 have already saved the government approximately 170 million bahraini dinars 450 million per year the fourth which builds on the third is a reformulation of the prevailing subsidy system which is largely not determined by income providing rich and poor with equal access to subsidies the plan is to transition to a completely income contingent system to ensure that subsidies are not wasted on elevating the living standards of the richest segments of society saudi arabia introduced such a system in january 2018 households receive a direct financial transfer from the government depending on the household s gross income and when the household s income is sufficiently high it no longer qualifies for any income support the fifth is improving the efficiency of government expenditure through measures such as tackling corruption and establishing an office dedicated to the task of managing the national debt the sixth is simplifying government processes and increasing non oil revenue this involves the continuation of the government s digitization plans which includes the recent transition to amazon web services for all governmental organizations since the establishment of the information and egovernment authority in 2007 originally as the egovernment it was subsequently merged with the national statistics office the bahraini government has seen massive savings predominantly from labor saving upgrades in efforts to increase non oil revenue bahrain has imposed a value added tax and has indicated it plans to introduce other revenue generating instruments will the plan succeed some of the early indications are positive but before exploring them it is worth explaining the theory of why austerity packages frequently fail as has happened in many latin american countries and even recently in certain western european ones the basic problem is that fiscal belt tightening involves diminishing the resources controlled by bureaucracies something that bureaucracies are built to resist this problem is exacerbated by the fact that many government services are natural monopolies law enforcement immigration legislative bodies and so on meaning that there is no competition to impose financial discipline on their activities moreover governments have deep pockets due to their ability to borrow billions of dollars at low cost in global financial markets consequently government bureaucracies are not used to having to restructure or downsize their activities in response to competitive forces by default they just tend to bloat over time in contrast a private company regularly has to expand or shrink its operations as market conditions change making it much more malleable in the context of bahrain s fiscal balance program there are four factors that serve to increase the likelihood of success first the high level of the public debt has resulted in increased interest payments and even precipitated a currency run during the summer of 2018 which was overcome when the ministers of partner gulf countries delivered a joint statement to markets assuring them of their support for the bahraini economy the large public debt means that bahrain can no longer afford to delay reforms in contrast a country such as kuwait can take its time over fiscal reforms due to the prevailing budget surplus and the low public debt in this sense bahrain has a very strong incentive to make its fiscal balance program succeed second in december 2018 bahrain restructured its ministry of finance renaming it the ministry of finance and national economy to emphasize the government s awareness of the importance of fiscal sustainability to the economy new departments have been established with tasks that relate directly to the fiscal balance program and involving the same personnel who worked on formulating the plan this will help overcome the natural bureaucratic reluctance to implement such deep reforms third the involvement of bahrain s three gulf partners adds considerable weight to those in charge of implementing the fiscal balance program the performance of the economy is now seen as a central component of national security moreover kuwait saudi arabia and the uae have a strong interest in seeing a secure and prosperous bahrain due to the importance of bahraini national security to their own this regional support strengthens the hand of the bahraini government as it moves to implement reforms some of which have been met with resistance the bahraini government has made a positive start despite widespread handwringing among parliamentarians and on social media the value added tax was implemented according to schedule in january and subsidy reforms continue according to schedule traditionally in resource rich economies it is precisely these kinds of unpopular policies that are canceled at the first hurdle moreover thousands of government employees have retired early and will continue exiting in organized tranches over the course of the year there are many difficult challenges ahead in implementing the fiscal balance program including the transition to a means tested system of subsidies and in the review of government service fees however the initial indications give cause for optimism as the newly elected parliament settles in and the expenditure reforms begin to solidify the second half of 2019 will offer an opportunity to evaluate progress
source xinhua 2019 04 11 01 43 47 editor yan video player close ankara april 10 xinhua turkey s treasury and finance minister berat albayrak announced on wednesday a long awaited economic recovery plan focusing on the financial sector in an effort to bring the recession hit country back to growth the plan aiming to boost investors confidence comes as turkey faces serious economic problems tensions with nato ally the united states over ankara s planned purchase of russian s 400 air defense system and a dispute over the mayoral elections in the nation s biggest city and economic hub istanbul turkey s economy had witnessed sustained growth for years but the country entered its first recession in a decade last month after a currency meltdown last summer which resulted in a growing pile of bad debts for banks the turkish lira has lost some 40 percent of its value since then and the inflation remains around 20 percent despite government measures announced in september to combat price hikes and high unemployment in a meeting in istanbul albayrak said that the financial sector was to be prioritized in the new set of structural reforms that will apply for 2019 only state owned banks will get 28 billion lira 4 92 billion u s dollars worth of government bonds as capital injection in order to strengthen the banking sector said albayrak the minister also indicated that the government will widen the tax base and deal with unregistered economy to bring the ailing economy to safer grounds in line with budget discipline we will reduce exclusions and exemptions in turkey s new tax structure and corporate tax will be gradually reduced we will take steps to ensure fairer taxation on higher income groups that will have minimum effect on inflation the minister announced turkish voters in the two largest cities istanbul and ankara appeared to blame erdogan s ruling justice and development party akp for the economic downturn and rising food prices electing opposition candidates on the municipal elections on march 31 the akp has since disputed the istanbul vote and called for a new election causing concerns among investors the turkish minister said that his country will launch a national unity project in agriculture aimed at fighting inflation and especially food prices adding that this project will be unveiled in may albayrak furthermore said that government loans would prioritize strategic sectors exports and value added and local production he said that the government planned to integrate the country s severance pay fund with its private retirement insurance fund to be more sustainable in order to support the economy in the next five years funds accumulated in the new retirement system will exceed 10 percent of the country s gross domestic product the minister insisted some analysts called on the turkish government to take more drastic action to restore growth my understanding about this announcement is that new taxes are on the way for citizens commented economist yalcin karatepe from the ankara university on twitter albayrak is expected to travel to washington at the end of the week to attend meetings hosted by the international monetary fund imf and the world bank erdogan ruled out several times that turkey would have to knock at the imf s door for a bailout plan as it did after the 2001 economic crisis
a year ago economic activity was accelerating in almost all regions of the world one year later much has changed the escalation of us china trade tensions needed credit tightening in china macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany and financial tightening alongside the normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half of 2018 with this weakness expected to persist into the first half of 2019 our new world economic outlook weo projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy global growth softened to 3 6 percent in 2018 and is projected to decline further to 3 3 percent in 2019 the downward revision in growth of 0 2 percentage points for 2019 from the january projection is also broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 this pickup is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential the us federal reserve the european central bank the bank of japan and the bank of england have all shifted to a more accommodative stance china has ramped up its fiscal and monetary stimulus to counter the negative effect of trade tariffs furthermore the outlook for us china trade tensions has improved as the prospects of a trade agreement take shape after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 these policy responses have helped reverse the tightening of financial conditions to varying degrees across countries emerging markets have experienced some resumption in portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the us dollar while the improvement in financial markets has been rapid those in the real economy have been slow to materialize measures of industrial production and investment remain weak for now in many advanced and emerging market economies and global trade has yet to recover with improved prospects for the second half of 2019 global growth in 2020 is projected to return to 3 6 percent this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies where growth is projected to increase from 4 4 percent in 2019 to 4 8 percent in 2020 specifically it relies on an expected rebound in growth in argentina and turkey and some improvement in a set of other stressed developing economies and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty growth in advanced economies will slow slightly in 2020 despite a partial recovery in the euro area as the impact of us fiscal stimulus fades and growth tends toward the modest potential for the group given aging trends and low productivity growth beyond 2020 global growth is expected to stabilize at around 3½ percent bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent though with considerable variance as emerging asia continues to grow faster than other regions a similar pattern holds for low income countries with some particularly commodity importers growing rapidly but others falling further behind the advanced world in per capita terms risks to global growth while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks tensions in trade policycould flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains growth in systemic economies such as the euro area and china may surprise on the downside and the risks surrounding brexit remain heightened a deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries including sovereign bank doom loop risks loading building more inclusive economies given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment fiscal policy will need to manage trade offs between supporting demand protecting social spending and ensuring that public debt remains on a sustainable path with the optimal mix depending on country specific circumstances financial sector policies must address vulnerabilities proactively by deploying macroprudential tools such as counter cyclical capital buffers a task made more urgent by the possibility that interest rates will remain low for longer monetary policy should remain data dependent be well communicated and ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience there is a need for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts to address climate change and risks from cybersecurity and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation

guest observation this is an edited extract from guy debelle s speech to the american chamber of commerce in australia amcham business luncheon adelaide 10 april 2019 it is important to remember that the australian economy and financial conditions are significantly influenced by global developments the global economy recorded a strong pace of growth through 2017 and the first half of 2018 but the global economy lost momentum in the second half of 2018 and that loss of momentum has continued into 2019 gdp growth slowed in china and the euro area in the second half of 2018 though it continued at a more than respectable pace in the united states while we don t yet have gdp readings for 2019 the loss of momentum is evident in business surveys of manufacturing conditions in many economies the slowdown is not as marked in surveys of business conditions in the services sectors this potentially indicates that the drivers of the slowdown are more external rather than internal services say more about domestic demand which has been more resilient it is worth remembering that we have both more and more frequent economic indicators of manufacturing than we do of the services sector the higher frequency data on the manufacturing sector often drives the news cycle yet in many economies including australia the services sector accounts for well over half of the economy at the same time as gdp growth has slowed the labour market in a number of economies has remained strong graph 1 this is particularly true in germany canada and the united kingdom in each of these economies gdp barely grew in the fourth quarter of 2018 but all recorded solid employment growth above average in some cases in the united states gdp growth was around 2 annualised in the final quarter employment growth was almost as strong graph 1 a critical question is which of these is providing the best signal of the global growth impulse is it gdp or the labour market how can we reconcile the difference one explanation is that productivity growth is weak but by and large that is just a tautology productivity growth is the rate of growth in output less the rate of growth in employment so saying that it is low is just an accounting outcome of strong employment and weak output growth another explanation is that the labour market is a lagging indicator that is the strength of the labour market is simply a reflection of the strength in output in the first half of 2018 that may be the case but the strength in the labour market has continued in these economies into the first few months of 2019 this begs the question of why are businesses still continuing to hire people in the face of a slowdown in growth that started over six months ago i will come back to this issue in the australian context later the continued strong growth in employment has seen unemployment rates in the united states germany the united kingdom and japan decline to multi decade lows as a result wages growth is picking up in all of these economies the pick up in wages has taken longer and been more gradual than expected but it is happening now wages growth is currently running above 3 in the united states the united kingdom and germany in each case this is the highest pace of wages growth in around a decade in japan wages growth is in positive territory but this pick up in wages growth has yet to translate into any noticeable rise in inflation the sharp fall in oil prices towards the end of 2018 has dampened inflation though oil prices have rebounded in recent months so this disinflationary impulse has run its course for the time being china coming back to the key question what has caused the global economy to slow one explanation is china the chinese economy has slowed some of the slowing was expected as labour force growth in china slows with the population dynamics furthermore the high rate of productivity growth could not be sustained given the transformation of the economy that has already occurred this slowing has been reflected in forecasts of chinese growth for some time but the recent slowdown has been more than expected and in particular more than the chinese policymakers appear to have expected a significant contributor to the slowdown has been the clampdown on shadow or non bank finance this was done deliberately to address the financial stability concerns arising from the high and rapidly growing stock of debt the clampdown on non bank finance particularly affected the private sector in china which has been an important engine of growth chinese policymakers have responded to the slowdown by providing some stimulus this has been done in a measured way there has been increased fiscal stimulus including through increased infrastructure spending the authorities are trying to balance the objective of restraining debt growth against the need to support activity and employment hence the stimulus is not of the scale that was implemented at various times over the past decade they have also aimed to alleviate the monetary restraint but there is a question of how effective or timely this stimulus might be given that credit is being provided primarily through the core state owned banking system rather than the non bank financial sector the state owned banks have not traditionally been that focused on lending to the private sector as they begin to do so they are needing to enhance their credit assessment skills hence the effect of this stimulus may take a little while to become apparent the effect of the various elements of policy stimulus in china will have different effects on different parts of the global economy a crude characterisation is that the australian economy will benefit from the infrastructure spending germany from investment spending industrial production and italy and germany too from consumer discretionary spending the various indicators in graph 2 provide one lens through which to view the impact of the policy stimulus across these different sectors of the chinese economy graph 2 a final point on the chinese economy even more than in other countries it is very hard to get a read on household spending on services in china yet that is accounting for an increasingly large share of the chinese economy global trade another factor that has contributed to the decline in global growth is the escalation in trade tensions the effect has been more from the uncertainty about where the trade disputes might land rather than the tariffs that have been implemented to date my sense is that while businesses would prefer not to have the tariffs in place at all if they knew what they were and that they were unlikely to change then they could plan around them but the ongoing uncertainty about when china and the united states are likely to reach a deal what form that deal might take and how durable that deal might be makes it difficult to make investment decisions on new productive capacity this is particularly the case for investment decisions for businesses in the global supply chain do various parts of the global supply chain need to relocate if so to where that investment uncertainty has played out in many economies particularly in the manufacturing sector the slowdown in investment spending has affected economies along the supply chain including germany financial markets turning briefly to global financial developments there was a marked decline in many asset prices at the end of 2018 part of the decline reflected a welcome correction from stretched asset valuations but the speed of the decline overlaid with growing unease about the slowdown in the global economy heightened concerns subsequently many of these asset price movements have been reversed global equity prices had one of their best quarters in the first quarter of this year credit spreads which had widened have tightened back to their previous low levels as a result global financial conditions are very accommodative there has also been a marked reassessment of the expected future path of monetary policies graph 3 where the market had been expecting further interest rate rises in the united states and other countries in 2019 it now expects interest rate reductions this shift in policy expectations combined with increased pessimism about the global economic outlook has seen government bond yields decline significantly in australia the 10 year bond yield reached an historic low of 1 73 in march graph 3 as a result of the decline in us yields there has been much commentary recently about the fact that the us yield curve became inverted that is short term yields were higher than long term yields in the past this has often been a leading indicator of a recession in the united states graph 4 graph 4 in thinking about this issue there are a few considerations that are worth bearing in mind firstly term premia in sovereign bond markets are unusually low or even negative that is there is no compensation for the risk of holding a longer term government bond over a short term bond historically this premium in the united states has averaged around 150 basis points if that was the premium today the yield curve would be a fair way from inversion secondly in the past the yield curve has inverted when the policy rate has risen into clearly restrictive territory that is not obviously the case today thirdly as i just mentioned credit spreads are tightening this doesn t normally happen as the economy slows corporate bondholders generally want increased compensation for the risk of default which rises in a recession australian economy turning to the australian economy gdp growth has come in weaker than we expected in the second half of 2018 graph 5 some of the weakness was temporary such as the disruption to resource exports and the effect of the drought but the primary reason for this has been that consumption growth has been markedly slower than we had forecast partly this was because the rate of consumption growth was revised lower than had been earlier reported but beyond that the growth in consumption in the second half of the year was considerably slower than we had anticipated graph 5 why did consumption growth slow so markedly in the second half of the year some part of the slowdown is likely to be related to the declines in housing prices primarily in sydney and melbourne i am not so sure that is from the direct wealth effect of lower housing prices as much as it is from the fact that turnover in the housing market is at very low levels as is typically the case when housing prices have been falling as people are moving house less they are spending less on things like household furnishings they are also spending less on cars one puzzle related to the possible wealth effect is that the slowdown in household spending has been much more pronounced in new south wales than it has been in victoria despite similar declines in housing prices while population growth in victoria is higher than in new south wales that doesn t account for the whole difference in my view the main explanation as to why consumption growth has slowed is the low growth in household income and an increasing expectation that it is likely to remain low the governor has made this point in recent commentary my colleague luci ellis recently examined why household income growth has been low while consumption has been unexpectedly weak other parts of gdp have evolved broadly as we had expected business investment outside the mining sector has been growing at a good rate graph 6 some part of this is related to the infrastructure spending occurring right round the country but far from all of it there has been strong growth in investment in machinery equipment and software mining investment has continued its large decline from its peak five years ago but that decline is about at the end indeed mining investment is likely to increase again soon this will be nothing like the large boom of a decade ago but it will be positive nonetheless and so will no longer be a drag on economic growth graph 6 exports have continued to grow as expected graph 7 notwithstanding some temporary disruptions to resource exports the investment in the resources sector over the past decade is bearing fruit in terms of increased exports of iron ore and lng there is further growth in lng to come in the year although beyond that there is likely to be limited scope for further increases in resource exports without a further increase in investment in the sector service exports which include education and tourism continue to grow manufacturing exports have grown quite strongly of late some of this is high tech manufacturing and some of this is wine and food a significant part of which comes from south australia graph 7 the effect of the drought is evident in the recent decline in rural exports in aggregate the drought subtracted around ¼ percentage point from aggregate growth in the second half of 2018 hopefully normal seasonal conditions will return in time for the winter crop this year dwelling investment residential construction is at a historically high level the recent flow of building approvals implies a much lower level of activity once the current pipeline of activity is completed which leads me onto the housing market the supply demand dynamics are playing out in the housing market at the moment there have been large falls in house prices in sydney and melbourne over the past year or so following very large increases in the preceding five years graph 8 there is more supply to come onto the market in melbourne and sydney over the remainder of the year which will further weigh on prices one notable difference between the two cities that may affect their ability to absorb this additional supply is that the vacancy rate in melbourne is at a very low level while that in sydney is above average and rising similarly advertised rents in melbourne are increasing while those in sydney are falling graph 8 in adelaide the cycle has been considerably less pronounced the median house price in adelaide has increased a little over the past year and has grown at an average pace of around 4 per annum over the past five years the residential construction cycle has also been considerably more muted in south australia than in other states we continue to pay close attention to the housing market developments my colleague michele bullock talked about the financial stability implications of the housing market in a recent speech and we will shortly publish our semi annual financial stability review which will discuss the issue in greater detail one of the main indicators about the impact of the unfolding dynamics in the housing market is the mortgage arrears rate the arrears rate has been edging up but remains at a low level much of the increase in arrears has been in western australia negative equity where the value of the property is less than the value of the mortgage has also increased though our estimates are that it also is at a low level and is again concentrated in western australia and mining regions the critical factor in the future evolution of both arrears and negative equity is whether the household with the mortgage has an income and a job the labour market is key here and i will turn to that now labour market at the same time as gdp has been surprisingly weak the labour market has been surprisingly strong the unemployment rate has declined faster than we had forecast and employment growth is stronger than we had earlier forecast graph 9 shows the decline in the unemployment rate as well as the underemployment rate which takes account of the fact that some people would like to work more hours than they currently do the decline in the unemployment rate has been most evident in new south wales and victoria in both states it is around multi decade lows the unemployment rate in south australia is higher than that but lower than it is in some of the other states graph 9 the strength of the labour market is at odds with the slow pace of gdp growth as i said above the labour market could be a lagging indicator but at the same time businesses continued to invest through the end of 2018 and have continued to hire into 2019 why would they do this if growth in economic activity has slowed so much moreover while employment has continued to grow strongly forward looking indicators of labour demand suggest future employment growth will remain solid the job advertisement series have declined somewhat recently but the abs vacancy series which surveys businesses about their current level of vacancies remains at a very high level graph 10 graph 10 the two lenses on economic growth provided by the labour market and the gdp data are in stark contrast a third lens in the form of business surveys sits in between the two graph 11 business conditions have declined from their high levels of the first half of 2018 but still remain consistent with around trend growth in the economy this is also the sense i get from the bank s extensive business liaison program graph 11 the tension highlighted by these different lenses on economic growth is of crucial importance hopefully we will get some resolution of this tension in the coming months with the incoming flow of data as the unemployment rate has declined and employment growth has remained strong wages growth has passed its trough but the pick up is only gradual graph 12 using disaggregated data the small and gradual pick up in the wage price index can be explained by a decrease in the prevalence of wage freezes the share of workers experiencing wage freezes has declined as they move off wage freezes these workers are getting wage increases of a bit above 3 those workers who had been getting 2 3 wage outcomes have generally not been receiving higher wage outcomes lately graph 12 this low rate of wages growth has been a major contributor to the rate of inflation remaining a little below the inflation target in recent years graph 13 for inflation to rise to be sustainably within the inflation target range of 2 3 we need to see higher wages growth we will get a read on the march quarter consumer price index in a few weeks time graph 13 conclusion i have highlighted some of the issues and tension both globally and domestically around the economic outlook globally the effectiveness and extent of the stimulus measures in china in addressing the slowdown in chinese growth is one of the key uncertainties trade developments is another domestically i have highlighted the challenge in determining the current and future pace of growth in the economy posed by the conflicting signals provided by the labour market the gdp data and the business surveys how those tensions are resolved will play a critical role in whether we continue to make satisfactory progress in achieving the goals of full employment and the inflation target guy debelle is the deputy governor of the reserve bank of australia
the inverted yield curve as a harbinger of higher gold prices during the course of the past few weeks we have heard much about the inverted yield curve in three month and ten year treasuries as a harbinger of recessions missed in the press reports is the fact that it has also been a harbinger of higher gold prices in the chart above please note the upward surges in the price of gold in the five year periods following the two most recent yield inversions in 2000 and 2006 the first occurred with gold trading in the 300 range it subsequently rose to the 600 650 level in 2006 the second occurred with gold priced in the 600 650 range it subsequently rose to over 1900 per ounce in 2011 its all time high grey vertical bars indicate recessions ominously writes robin wigglesworth and joe rennison in a recent financial times editorial the us yield curve has now inverted once again with the 10 year treasury yield on march 22 dipping below the three month t bill yield for the first time since 2007 combined with the length of the post crisis expansion this summer it will become the longest growth spurt in us history and deteriorating economic data the inverted yield curve has stirred fears that the countdown to the next downturn has already begun peter fisher formerly head of fixed income at blackrock and currently a professor at tuck school of business at dartmouth puts it succinctly in that same financial times editorial the mistake he says is to think it is a predictor of recessions i think it causes recessions the rise in the price of gold following the two prior instances of yield inversion it is now well understood came in response to aggressive central bank monetary easing and the sudden emergence of credit related systemic risks fed and white house go to war over monetary policy in an ideal world the fed would be above politics the american political landscape these days however is far from ideal fed chairman powell migrated to a more dovish stance on monetary policy following the december stock market scare but from president trump s perspective that stance is not dovish enough i personally think the fed should drop rates mr trump recently told white house reporters i think they really slowed us down there s no inflation i would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easing you would see a rocket ship such a statement by itself would be enough under ordinary circumstances to motivate some judicious position adjustments on wall street s trading desks mr trump though has upped the ante by offering up two federal reserve board nominees stephen moore and herman cain known more for their hardened political sympathies than economic policy objectivity that shift could send wall street speculators into overdrive as we enter the election season and simultaneously heighten gold s safe haven appeal the federal reserve board of governors looks to be on a path to becoming not just more politically inclined as the presidential election cycle draws near but highly politicized the fed s reaction to the market retreat of last december has made it look indecisive and confused the white house for its part seems all too eager to shift the blame for any imminent slowdown to the fed the nation as a result finds itself in the unprecedented situation of witnessing the executive branch of government in outright conflict with its central bank china is on a big gold buying spree china s on a bullion buying spree says bloomberg s ranjeetha pakiam the world s second largest economy expanded its gold reserves for the fourth straight month adding to optimism that central banks globally will continue to build holdings the people s bank of china raised reserves to 60 62 million ounces in march from

december keep in mind that china the world s leading mine producer keeps most its domestic gold production roughly 450 tonnes per year within its borders though china does not officially claim that production as part of its national reserves many gold market experts believe it ends up in the coffers of either the national government or the central bank acknowledged or not last year central banks purchased a record 650 tonnes of gold in the aggregate according to the world gold council add china s production and official sector offtake vaults to 1100 tonnes 70 higher than the wgc s widely touted number and a little over one third of global mine supply latest q ratio illustrates overvalued the stock market the q ratio writes lorimer wilson at munknee com the total price of the market divided by the replacement cost of all its companies is a popular method of estimating the fair value of the stock market and it shows that the stock market is overvalued by 50 compared to its

still suitably undervalued in 2019 the price of a fine suit of men s clothes says the u s geological survey can be used to show anyone who is not familiar with the price history of gold just how very cheap gold is today with an ounce of gold a man could buy a fine suit of clothes in the time of shakespeare in that of beethoven and jefferson and in the depression of the 1930s so where do we stand in 2019 with respect to the quality man s attire gold ratio at brooks brothers a top quality off the rack suit ranges between 2625 and 3122 without a vest brooks brothers carries a less expensive suit at about 1250 but the ratio requires a top not lower or middle quality man s suit on london s saville row the standard for quality men s attire a hand tailored men s suit ranges in price from 3500 4620 at huntsman to 4950 6534 at kilgour as published in gentleman s quarterly by any of those measures gold at 1300 per ounce is suitably undervalued economic insecurity is becoming the new hallmark of old age in the united states writes katherine s newman and rebecca hayes jacobs for the nation economic security in old age was seen for a long time as both a social issue and a national obligation from the birth of social security to the end of the 20th century the common assumption has been that we have a shared responsibility to secure a decent retirement for our citizens yet that notion is weakening rapidly instead we have started to hear echoes of the mantra of self reliance that characterized welfare reform in the 1990s you alone are in charge of your retirement if you wind up in poverty in your old age you have only your own inability to plan save and invest to blame some compare today s stock market psychology to the period just before 2008 others compare it to the 1920s when everything was hunky dory until suddenly it wasn t perhaps a more apt comparison too many are all in with respect to stocks in their individual retirement accounts hoping to accumulate as much capital as possible without regard to the potential downside the stock market did not recover from the losses accumulated between 1929 and 1933 until the mid 1950s almost 25 years later a fragment of stock market history lost to time some will rely on the fact that stocks recovered nicely once the fed launched the 2009 bailout we should keep in mind though that many prominent wall street analysts have warned that the fed no longer has the firepower now it did then the financial markets and economy are much more vulnerable as a result all of which brings us back to the notions of self reliance and taking personal responsibility for our retirement plans if you find yourself among the group that thinks hedging a stock market downturn to be in your best interest we can help you easily and effectively structure a gold and silver diversification as part of your retirement plan to hedge that possibility american eagle coin sales up sharply over last year the u s mint reports sales of american eagle gold and silver bullion coins running well ahead of last year s pace at the end of march gold eagle sales were up 33 3 over last year s first quarter performance while silver eagle sales were up 37 9 over the same period month over month gold eagle sales were more than three times higher than sales from march of last year silver eagle sales were down 7 when compared to march of last year the strong uptick indicates increased activity among american investors interested in including gold and silver in their holdings as safe haven hedges and as an underpriced asset class tech analyst gold could go to 1800 to 2200 in long run a number of technical analysts have reverted to a more bearish forecast over the past few weeks with the 1250 area once again being touted as the downside support area many of those same technical analysts though have a significantly more positive outlook for the longer term among that group is gary wagner of the wagner financial group who sees 1267 or even 1247 as possibilities in the short run but also forecasts the possibility of 1800 to 2200 in the longer run our research he explains in an article published recently at the singapore bullion market association website suggests that gold is in the final phase of a major long term impulse cycle this model also provides a look back at the final major bullish wave could be traced back to end of 2015 following a correction to 1 040 this corrective fourth wave developed from the all time high at 1 900 in 2011 the model suggests that gold could re test the record highs that if taken out could see an extensive surge to between 1800 and 2200 per troy ounce at usagold it bears repeating we have always advocated the ownership of both gold and silver coins and bullion for long term asset preservation purposes rather than short term speculative gain though we report on the short term we do so with the caveat that anything can happen the analyst who forecasts a short term downside today can quickly change his or her outlook to the upside tomorrow or vice versa the long term charts for gold and silver though reveal a consistent upward trend that has served investors well in the period since 1971 when the global monetary system departed the gold standard and entered the fiat money era is warren buffett wrong about gold while i very often agree with warren buffett s views regarding for example the level of cash in portfolio or migration from growth to value stocks says independent trader for etf trends i absolutely can not agree with what he wrote in the letter to shareholders about gold once again showing how badly it performs in comparison to the us shares the article goes on from there to debunk buffett s latest attack on gold one of many he has conducted over the years while drawing on cyclical analysis to lay out a solid longer term future for the metal it concludes with the opinion that buffett s stance on gold is part of a deal with the establishment of the united states that could be true but it could also be little more than an old professional bias going back decades we counter with a single chart that refutes buffett s argument at a glance it tells the story of gold and stocks in the time in which we live the historically distinct fiat money era that began in 1971 not some other timeline that carries little relationship to the present to make a very long story short gold has appreciated 3 399 since january 1971 stocks have appreciated 2 884 live daily newsletter i cannot stress enough how important it is for everybody

times of crisis this is one of the few things left to be accepted gold was the only thing left to the people of the city at that time before the silver cutlery was also traded at the farmer ewald

above 1 400 vs just a few months ago when it was below 1 200 yet headwinds are dropping fast with a lofty dollar the primary remaining holdout the unlikely is necessary for gold not to resume the rally it began about two decades ago in our view gold is in a similar extreme coiled spring condition as in 1997 but with the dollar at multiyear highs such as in 2002 unless the greenback can manage further appreciation gold should which is what we expect mike mcglone bloomberg intelligence for we have reached a critical point in a sense it is true that the mists are lifting we can at least see clearly the gulf to which our present path is leading few of us doubt that we must without much more delay find an effective means to raise world prices or we must expect the progressive breakdown of the existing structure of contract and instruments of indebtedness accompanied by the utter discredit of orthodox leadership in finance and government with what outcome we cannot predict john maynard keynes the means to prosperity 1933 gold is money a rather rock steady type of money at that and it cannot be debased by central banks money printing thus it stands in sharp contrast to bank deposits

monetary theory confusing money creation with wealth creation was at the core of the debate between john law and richard cantillon 300 years ago for law a scot who fled british justice took refuge in france and within a few years managed to drive what was then the leading economic power of the day into near bankruptcy increases in the supply of money would lead to the employment of unused land and labor which in turn would lead to higher productivity meanwhile cantillon explained in his essay on commerce that mistaking money for wealth always leads to disaster charles gave evergreen gavekal editor s note at the risk of sounding cynical it would not be difficult to imagine the federal reserve make that the world central banks proceeding with some version of mmt even while railing against it and saying they would never engage in such a thing how far from mmt was quantitative easing not far we would venture in modern times the lessons of zimbabwe and venezuela point to the catastrophic effects that can follow when a corrupt or incompetent government finances its lavish spending by printing more of its currency the gold standard favors the countries that have gold deposits but it has the advantage of making it difficult for governments to inflate prices by expanding the money supply it engenders long term price stability because the money supply can only grow at the rate at which gold is produced inflation can come though if a major new source of gold is developed as happened with spanish gold from the new world or with various gold rushes adam smith institute a word on

earlier this week i discussed what is money how it differs from currency and the problems with the most current modern monetary theory mmt i believe it s also important to go a bit deeper into fiat currencies and explain why they were invented and are still in use and the issues that arise from centrally controlling the printing of money the british pound is the oldest fiat currency in existence at 317 years the pound was originally defined as 12 oz of silver it s now worth less than 0 5 of its original value in other words the most successful long standing currency in existence has lost 99 5 of its value dan hedl danheld september 8 2018 what are fiat currencies and how do they work fiat currency refers to any currency that a government declares to be legal tender legal tender in this context means that the money has the full backing of the government that issues it throughout history fiat currencies have followed a cycle of rising and eventually collapsing often due to devaluation the idea is that a central authority that can enforce human law and justice by power of force can demand its people to pay taxes in a single currency which happens to be minted by said central authority even though today that task is carried out by banks not only central banks but commercial and investment banks as well through loans and deposits our economy is still facing the same risks the very first fiat currencies did like the roman denarius at the onset of the 1st century ad the denarius was a roman coin made up of pure silver by 54 ad during the reign of emperor nero the denarius silver content had been reduced to approximately 94 silver the silver content was further reduced to 85 by 100 ad courtesy of all succeeding emperors by devaluing the silver content of the denarius the emperors could simultaneously pay off their debts and become rich too this idea caught on and every succeeding emperor wanted to devalue the denarius to increase their wealth by 218 ad the silver content of the denarius was at 43 in 244 ad emperor philip the arab further cut it to around 0 05 silver by the time the roman empire was collapsing the denarius contained 0 02 silver and nobody used it as a store of value or medium of exchange what are the advantages over sound money back in the day most economists and financial experts would tell you fiat currencies are a great way of dealing money because they would be backed by multiple assets of course we now know that statement is just a blunt lie as fiat money is always backed by trust so in theory there could be an advantage in having an unlimited money supply controlled by a responsible and transparent central entity imagine being able to add extra currency units to facilitate the exchange of goods and services what about doing the same to build roads hospitals schools and every other necessary infrastructure to improve living conditions that was the ultimate promise of fiat money to free people from the shackles of sound money which cannot be created and which has a limited supply meaning there would always be greater growth constraints for when there is no more currency to add into the market fiat currency throughout history i ve discussed how rome introduced the concept of fiat currencies by melting precious metals like gold and silver and mixing them with ordinary metals like copper which would allow for more currency to be added into the market but what happens when prices catch up with the additional quantity of currency circulating let s jump into centuries old china china first started using fiat money in the 7th century at first the country used copper coins but made the switch to iron coins as there was a copper shortage unfortunately iron was easy to find and soon enough iron coins were overproduced eventually leading to their collapse in the 11th century a chinese bank situated in the szechuan province of china suggested the use of paper as currency for a brief moment this was okay as people could trade the paper currency for silk and precious metals china entered into a war with the mongols that proved to be too costly eventually leading to china s defeat and the collapse of the paper money kublai khan assumed leadership of china as told by marco polo kublai was able to unite china and every year he produced a vast amount of the paper currency he continued to print vast amounts of the paper money to the point of exceeding demand it eventually led to the fall of the paper currency which ruined even wealthy families and caused warfare and chaos are you wondering what s been happening more recently argentina was among the top 10 largest economies in the whole world back in 1932 however it dropped down the list as soon as its currency collapsed the same year in that same year italy norway and finland experienced currency shock that spread throughout the whole of europe in 1994 mexico too went through a currency collapse period whereby the peso lost its value throwing latin america into economic hardship in 1997 the thai baht collapsed spreading its effects to neighboring countries such as the philippines malaysia indonesia hong kong and south korea in 1998 the russian ruble brought the country into economic recession after its devaluation similar effects were witnessed in turkey when the turkish lira experienced hyperinflation currently zimbabwe remains top of the list of countries with the worst fiat currency failures through rampant money printing the state created hyperinflation the inflation hit 624 in 2004 and then rose to 11 000 per year after that the zimbabwe dollar lost value to the point that it became completely worthless today we have the us dollar which has devalued more than 94 since its creation why will fiat currencies always fail i ve spoken of the greatest advantage of fiat currencies being the fact they introduce an unlimited money supply to facilitate growth and commerce however as adam smith duly noted when he wrote the wealth of nations human beings are self interested and will always do what s best for them it becomes very easy to implement bad practices and protect one s power in the current fiat system this means there is no way a central entity will behave nicely when there s no way to impose the will of the people on the decision making process the reason why fiat currencies will always fail is because anyone coordinating the supply of money will get greedy and produce considerably more units of currency than needed meaning at some point the economy will deflate or hyperinflate destroying people s accumulated value if we want to understand money we should opt to use a form of sound money like bitcoin it s easy to trade we can store value in it and it s quite divisible in a sense it s the new internet gold so now i ask you why wouldn t you want to get as much bitcoin as possible if its supply is limited its fundamentals work and it can t be blocked

with the european central bank the latest major central bank to hold interest rates steady and the federal reserve scheduled to release minutes from its last meeting investors have plenty to chew on today from monetary policy makers for now as it waits for earnings season to start up in earnest later this week the market seems happy with the wait and see approach from the ecb which echoes the dovish stance taken by the fed that has helped boost stocks so far this year at the last fed meeting the central bank held rates steady and sent strong signals that there might be no more rate hikes at all this year citing slowing economic growth today with the minutes investors may try to glean more about policy makers outlook on the economy inflation and interest rates but they may not find anything surprising the dovish stance from the central banks comes as global economic growth is forecast to not be as robust as once thought amid a continuing trade war between the united states and

with the european central bank the latest major central bank to hold interest rates steady and the federal reserve scheduled to release minutes from its last meeting investors have plenty to chew on today from monetary policy makers for now as it waits for earnings season to start up in earnest later this week the market seems happy with the wait and see approach from the ecb which echoes the

higher shipments and pricing as well as cost management help martin marietta materials mlm to post solid first quarter 2019 results on apr 9 the international monetary fund imf reduced its growth forecast for the year once again the international lending body believes economic headwinds including monetary tightening by the federal reserve and trade conflicts could derail global growth in the months ahead the imf also cited industrial production data and surveys of purchasing managers to justify its projection for slower global growth in 2019 meanwhile even as china implements stimulus measures to boost its flagging economy the situation in eurozone remains worrying with a lurking global economic slowdown it makes sense to fortify your portfolio for such conditions in such an event demand for products and services generated by utilities consumer staples and medical companies remain invariant investing in stocks from these sectors looks like a smart option imf cuts global growth projections on tuesday the imf reduced its forecast for global economic growth for the third time in six months the international lending body now believes that global growth will clock in at 3 3 for 2019 0 2 lower than the estimate released in january however its projection for 2020 remained flat at 3 6 a major headwind for the global economy is the lingering trade war between the united states and china the imf thinks that the inability to come to an agreement and the resultant tariff barriers would result in higher costs of imported intermediate and capital goods and higher final goods prices for consumers and despite the federal reserve s recent attempts to step away from its earlier hawkish standpoint the imf thinks a change in the monetary stance of central banks could also imperil global growth the imf thinks that market expectations for the federal funds rate is well below the fed s projections according to the global lender this is likely to result in higher us interest rates renewed dollar appreciation and tighter financial conditions for emerging economies with large volumes of debt global stimulus needed eurozone vulnerable speaking at a news conference in washington on tuesday imf chief economist gita gopinath said that this was a delicate moment for the global economy the imf believes that coordinated global stimulus measures would be needed to cushion the impact of a sharp downturn gopinath added that a dovish monetary approach would also be needed to counter the slowdown according to the imf most of the global economy s likely troubles this year will originate from problems in developed economies including leading members of the eu apart from the impact of an inevitable brexit other factors are impeding growth in the region the outlook for germany the eurozone s economic powerhouse has softened because of sluggish demand for exports and a decline in consumer spending tougher emission standards are also likely to weigh on sales of cars produced in the country our choices the imf s decision to cut global growth projections is likely to rattle investors across the world the risks it lays out while justifying this reduction are very real and likely to weigh on the pace of economic expansion in the near term investing in stocks whose demand remains invariant even during an all encompassing slowdown looks prudent

ã ã international monetary fund imf chief economist gita gopinath speaks during a press conference in washington d c the united states on april 9 2019 the international monetary fund imf on tuesday lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3 3 percent in the newly released world economic outlook weo report down 0 2 percentage point from its estimation in january xinhua liu jie washington april 9 xinhua the international monetary fund imf on tuesday lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3 3 percent in the newly released world economic outlook weo report down 0 2 percentage point from its estimation in january the imf said the world economy faces downside risks brought by potential uncertainties in the ongoing global trade tensions as well as other country and sector specific factors global growth forecasts the 3 3 percent projection for 2019 is 0 3 percentage point below the 2018 figure followed by an expected return to 3 6 percent in 2020 growth rate projections for advanced economies are 1 8 percent for 2019 and 1 7 percent for 2020 both below the 2 percent plus rates recorded in the previous two years according to the weo report for emerging market and developing economies the imf predicted a growth rate down to 4 4 percent for 2019 0 1 percentage point lower than in 2018 and that expansion will rebound to a rate of 4 8 percent in 2020 leveling the 2017 outcome imf chief economist gita gopinath wrote in a blog post that the projected slowdown in 2019 is broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia gopinath said the loss of growth momentum said gopinath dates back to the second half of 2018 when the world economy was hit by a significantly weakened global expansion the weo report said global growth remained strong at 3 8 percent in the first half of 2018 but dropped to 3 2 percent in the second half gopinath blamed the situation largely on global trade tensions macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany and financial tightening alongside normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies with respect to the perceived recovery in 2020 the economist said it is precarious adding that it is based on the assumption that a rebound occurs in emerging market and developing economies gopinath said the uptick is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential she also cited a shift toward a more accommodative stance in central bank policies of the united states the european union eu japan and britain plus china ramping up its fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as a positive outlook for a u s china agreement to resolve their trade disputes these policy responses gopinath said have helped reverse the tightening financial conditions to varying degrees across countries featuring ongoing trends in the emerging markets such as a resumption of portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the u s dollar gopinath told a news conference tuesday that monetary policy space varies across different countries and for many advanced economies it remains limited we would expect to see unconventional monetary policy tools being used for instance in the euro area she said adding that inflation pressure staying low is a plus that will make even more accommodative monetary policy possible beyond 2020 the report predicted that global growth will plateau at about 3 6 percent over the medium term region specific projections the weo report expected growth rates in the euro zone to be 1 3 percent in 2019 and 1 5 percent in 2020 both lower than the 2018 and 2017 results eu wide downside risks include a protracted period of elevated bond yields in italy that would weigh on economic activity and worsen debt dynamics the rising possibility of britain leaving the eu without a deal as well as european parliamentary election outcomes that delay or reverse progress on strengthening the euro area architecture according to the report a no deal brexit that severely disrupts supply chains and raises trade costs could potentially have large and long lasting negative impacts on the economic well being of the united kingdom and the european union said the report asked at the press conference to comment on the state of the italian economy gopinath said the european country s growth in the second half of 2018 was particularly weak and that weakness carried over into 2019 high levels of debt as well as sovereign borrowing costs will be reflected in weaker investment and will remain concerns for italy especially given that growth in italy is weak not just in real terms but in nominal terms she said with regard to the united states it projected that the economy will grow by 2 3 percent in 2019 and expand at a lower rate of 1 9 percent in 2020 the report said the market implied path of expected policy rates remains below the u s federal reserve s projections raising the possibility of a market reassessment of the expected policy path if u s economic data remain strong this could result in higher u s interest rates renewed dollar appreciation and tighter financial conditions for emerging market and developing economies with balance sheet vulnerabilities the report said for china the growth rate is forecast to be 6 3 percent in 2019 up 0 1 percentage point from its previous estimation in january the chinese economy is forecast to expand by 6 1 percent in 2020 the post 2020 growth stabilization gopinath said is bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent with emerging economies in asia continuing to grow faster than other regions she added to prevent the downside risks from materializing gopinath urged the building of more inclusive economies adding that costly policy mistakes should be avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment she said across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience

investment and will remain concerns for italy especially given that growth in italy is weak not just in real terms but in nominal terms she said with regard to the united states it projected that the economy will grow by 2 3 percent in 2019 and expand at a lower rate of 1 9 percent in 2020 the report said the market implied path of expected policy rates remains below the u s federal reserve s projections raising the possibility of a market reassessment of the expected policy path if u s economic data remain strong this could result in higher u s interest rates renewed dollar appreciation and tighter financial conditions for emerging market and developing economies with balance sheet vulnerabilities the report said for china the growth rate is forecast to be 6 3 percent in 2019 up 0 1 percentage point from its previous estimation in january the chinese economy is forecast to expand by 6 1 percent in 2020 the post 2020 growth stabilization gopinath said is bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent with emerging economies in asia continuing to grow faster than other regions she added to prevent the downside risks from materializing gopinath urged the building of more inclusive economies adding that costly policy mistakes should be avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment she said across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience

by nottingham advisors has goldilocks returned to the world economy it certainly seems as though she is present here in the united states inflation is low to non existent we re at full employment growth is moderate if not steady and housing markets remain robust lastly it would appear the federal reserve is closer to an interest rate cut rather than a hike and the end of their balance sheet

14 58 and 14 57 respectively on the year fixed income yield curve inversion fears have increased since march 22nd when the 10 year treasury yield fell below that of the 3 month treasury bill yield we have had a minor inversion or a kink in the yield curve for some time now with the 2 year through 5 year treasury yields below those of shorter maturities the general interpretation was that the market expected a federal reserve rate cut during that time frame rather than predict a recession the 10 year treasury yield falling below the 3 month or 2 year treasury yield presents a more troubling situation a transitory inversion need not set off alarm bells a sustained inversion would be more concerning traditionally if the inversion lasts for a 3 month period the table has been set for a recession not immediately but typically one could be expected in the following two years this is something we will continue to track global central banks have been spooked by recent market volatility and economic data the european central bank pushed out expectations for an interest rate increase into 2020 which would mean that mario draghi would complete his nine year term without ever implementing a rate hike german 10 year yields have gone negative for the first time since 2016 according to tradeweb almost 47 of euro area government bonds have sub zero yields and the global amount of bonds with negative yields has surpassed 10 trillion the fed s most recent guidance continued to downplay any thought of raising rates with the dot plot chart showing rates on hold for the balance of 2019 the fed also announced an early end to their balance sheet roll off in october the balance sheet will no longer shrink as treasury agency investments mature or pay down instead the balance will be reinvested by purchasing treasury securities over time this will return the majority of the fed s holdings to treasury securities in the month of march investment grade corporate bonds were the best performer as spreads tightened for the third consecutive month high yield bonds had a positive return but faced a headwind of wider spreads giving back some of the performance recouped during

rates alternative investments alternative investments zigged and zagged in march as a confluence of weak global economic data falling interest rates and international geopolitics drove price action

published wednesday 10 april 2019 print disqus by michael kosares grey vertical bars indicate recessions during the course of the past few weeks we have heard much about the inverted yield curve in three month and ten year treasuries as a harbinger of recessions missed in the press reports is the fact that it has also been a harbinger of higher gold prices in the chart above please note the upward surges in the price of gold in the five year periods following the two most recent yield inversions in 2000 and 2006 the first occurred with gold trading in the 300 range it subsequently rose to the 600 650 level in 2006 the second occurred with gold priced in the 600 650 range it subsequently rose to over 1900 per ounce in 2011 its all time high ominously writes robin wigglesworth and joe rennison in a recent financial times editorial the us yield curve has now inverted once again with the 10 year treasury yield on march 22 dipping below the three month t bill yield for the first time since 2007 combined with the length of the post crisis expansion this summer it will become the longest growth spurt in us history and deteriorating economic data the inverted yield curve has stirred fears that the countdown to the next downturn has already begun peter fisher formerly head of fixed income at blackrock and currently a professor at tuck school of business at dartmouth puts it succinctly in that same financial times editorial the mistake he says is to think it is a predictor of recessions i think it causes recessions the rise in the price of gold following the two prior instances of yield inversion it is now well understood came in response to aggressive central bank monetary easing and the sudden emergence of credit related systemic risks fed and white house go to war over monetary policy in an ideal world the fed would be above politics the american political landscape these days however is far from ideal fed chairman powell migrated to a more dovish stance on monetary policy following the december stock market scare but from president trump s perspective that stance is not dovish enough i personally think the fed should drop rates mr trump recently told white house reporters i think they really slowed us down there s no inflation i would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easing you would see a rocket ship such a statement by itself would be enough under ordinary circumstances to motivate some judicious position adjustments on wall street s trading desks mr trump though has upped the ante by offering up two federal reserve board nominees stephen moore and herman cain known more for their hardened political sympathies than economic policy objectivity that shift could send wall street speculators into overdrive as we enter the election season and simultaneously heighten gold s safe haven appeal the federal reserve board of governors looks to be on a path to becoming not just more politically inclined as the presidential election cycle draws near but highly politicized the fed s reaction to the market retreat of last december has made it look indecisive and confused the white house for its part seems all too eager to shift the blame for any imminent slowdown to the fed the nation as a result finds itself in the unprecedented situation of witnessing the executive branch of government in outright conflict with its central bank china is on a big gold buying spree china s on a bullion buying spree says bloomberg s ranjeetha pakiam the world s second largest economy expanded its gold reserves for the fourth straight month adding to optimism that central banks globally will continue to build holdings the people s bank of china raised reserves to 60 62 million ounces in march from 60 26 million a month earlier according to data on its website in tonnage terms last month s inflow was 11 2 tons following the addition of 9 95 tons in february 11 8 tons in january and 9 95 tons in december keep in mind that china the world s leading mine producer keeps most its domestic gold production roughly 450 tonnes per year within its borders though china does not officially claim that production as part of its national reserves many gold market experts believe it ends up in the coffers of either the national government or the central bank acknowledged or not last year central banks purchased a record 650 tonnes of gold in the aggregate according to the world gold council add china s production and official sector offtake vaults to 1100 tonnes 70 higher than the wgc s widely touted number and a little over one third of global mine supply latest q ratio illustrates overvalued the stock market the q ratio writes lorimer wilson at munknee com the total price of the market divided by the replacement cost of all its companies is a popular method of estimating the fair value of the stock market and it shows that the stock market is overvalued by 50 compared to its arithmetic mean and by 62 compared to its geometric mean this article explains the q ratio more fully complete with illustrative charts those percentage valuations we believe are worth noting gold still suitably undervalued in 2019 the price of a fine suit of men s clothes says the u s geological survey can be used to show anyone who is not familiar with the price history of gold just how very cheap gold is today with an ounce of gold a man could buy a fine suit of clothes in the time of shakespeare in that of beethoven and jefferson and in the depression of the 1930s so where do we stand in 2019 with respect to the quality man s attire gold ratio at brooks brothers a top quality off the rack suit ranges between 2625 and 3122 without a vest brooks brothers carries a less expensive suit at about 1250 but the ratio requires a top not lower or middle quality man s suit on london s saville row the standard for quality men s attire a hand tailored men s suit ranges in price from 3500 4620 at huntsman to 4950 6534 at kilgour as published in gentleman s quarterly by any of those measures gold at 1300 per ounce is suitably undervalued economic insecurity is becoming the new hallmark of old age in the united states writes katherine s newman and rebecca hayes jacobs for the nation economic security in old age was seen for a long time as both a social issue and a national obligation from the birth of social security to the end of the 20th century the common assumption has been that we have a shared responsibility to secure a decent retirement for our citizens yet that notion is weakening rapidly instead we have started to hear echoes of the mantra of self reliance that characterized welfare reform in the 1990s you alone are in charge of your retirement if you wind up in poverty in your old age you have only your own inability to plan save and invest to blame some compare today s stock market psychology to the period just before 2008 others compare it to the 1920s when everything was hunky dory until suddenly it wasn t perhaps a more apt comparison too many are all in with respect to stocks in their individual retirement accounts hoping to accumulate as much capital as possible without regard to the potential downside the stock market did not recover from the losses accumulated between 1929 and 1933 until the mid 1950s almost 25 years later a fragment of stock market history lost to time some will rely on the fact that stocks recovered nicely once the fed launched the 2009 bailout we should keep in mind though that many prominent wall street analysts have warned that the fed no longer has the firepower now it did then the financial markets and economy are much more vulnerable as a result all of which brings us back to the notions of self reliance and taking personal responsibility for our retirement plans if you find yourself among the group that thinks hedging a stock market downturn to be in your best interest we can help you easily and effectively structure a gold and silver diversification as part of your retirement plan to hedge that possibility american eagle coin sales up sharply over last year the u s mint reports sales of american eagle gold and silver bullion coins running well ahead of last year s pace at the end of march gold eagle sales were up 33 3 over last year s first quarter performance while silver eagle sales were up 37 9 over the same period month over month gold eagle sales were more than three times higher than sales from march of last year silver eagle sales were down 7 when compared to march of last year the strong uptick indicates increased activity among american investors interested in including gold and silver in their holdings as safe haven hedges and as an underpriced asset class tech analyst gold could go to 1800 to 2200 in long run a number of technical analysts have reverted to a more bearish forecast over the past few weeks with the 1250 area once again being touted as the downside support area many of those same technical analysts though have a significantly more positive outlook for the longer term among that group is gary wagner of the wagner financial group who sees 1267 or even 1247 as possibilities in the short run but also forecasts the possibility of 1800 to 2200 in the longer run our research he explains in an article published recently at the singapore bullion market association website suggests that gold is in the final phase of a major long term impulse cycle this model also provides a look back at the final major bullish wave could be traced back to end of 2015 following a correction to 1 040 this corrective fourth wave developed from the all time high at 1 900 in 2011 the model suggests that gold could re test the record highs that if taken out could see an extensive surge to between 1800 and 2200 per troy ounce at usagold it bears repeating we have always advocated the ownership of both gold and silver coins and bullion for long term asset preservation purposes rather than short term speculative gain though we report on the short term we do so with the caveat that anything can happen the analyst who forecasts a short term downside today can quickly change his or her outlook to the upside tomorrow or vice versa the long term charts for gold and silver though reveal a consistent upward trend that has served investors well in the period since 1971 when the global monetary system departed the gold standard and entered the fiat money era is warren buffett wrong about gold while i very often agree with warren buffett s views regarding for example the level of cash in portfolio or migration from growth to value stocks says independent trader for etf trends i absolutely can not agree with what he wrote in the letter to shareholders about gold once again showing how badly it performs in comparison to the us shares the article goes on from there to debunk buffett s latest attack on gold one of many he has conducted over the years while drawing on cyclical analysis to lay out a solid longer term future for the metal it concludes with the opinion that buffett s stance on gold is part of a deal with the establishment of the united states that could be true but it could also be little more than an old professional bias going back decades we counter with a single chart that refutes buffett s argument at a glance it tells the story of gold and stocks in the time in which we live the historically distinct fiat money era that began in 1971 not some other timeline that carries little relationship to the present to make a very long story short gold has appreciated 3 399 since january 1971 stocks have appreciated 2 884 live daily newsletter i cannot stress enough how important it is for everybody

nowotny european central bank governor it s all about relative supply curves the supply curve for bullion is far more inelastic than is the case for paper money it really is that simple david rosenberg gluskin sheff stuck close to 1 300 an ounce in 1q gold is set to head for resistance at 1 400 instead of continuing to consolidate and revisit 1 200 it s been six years since gold traded above 1 400 vs just a few months ago when it was below 1 200 yet headwinds are dropping fast with a lofty dollar the primary remaining holdout the unlikely is necessary for gold not to resume the rally it began about two decades ago in our view gold is in a similar extreme coiled spring condition as in 1997 but with the dollar at multiyear highs such as in 2002 unless the greenback can manage further appreciation gold should which is what we expect mike mcglone bloomberg intelligence for we have reached a critical point in a sense it is true that the mists are lifting we can at least see clearly the gulf to which our present path is leading few of us doubt that we must without much more delay find an effective means to raise world prices or we must expect the progressive breakdown of the existing structure of contract and instruments of indebtedness accompanied by the utter discredit of orthodox leadership in finance and government with what outcome we cannot predict john maynard keynes the means to prosperity 1933 gold is money a rather rock steady type of money at that and it cannot be debased by central banks money printing thus it stands in sharp contrast to bank deposits and short term debt gold also does not carry any default or credit risk it cannot go bankrupt so to speak for thousands of years gold has already served as premium money it would be surprising if gold were not to withstand the sword of damocles in the form of unbacked paper money that central banks have hung over the economies thorsten polleit degussa market report this is the cave in which

modern monetary theory can gain credence in the public debate without encouraging a large consequent flight out of the dollar and into gold and silver the figure below shows that the uncertainty

line up to allow disaster the torrey canyon was hampered by an unforgiving schedule barely adequate charts unhelpful winds and currents confusion over the autopilot and the unexpected appearance of fishing boats in the intended course but reading richard petrow s contemporary account of the torrey canyon disaster a clear lesson is that capt rugiati was too slow to adjust he had a plan and saw far too late that the plan was doomed to failure and with it his ship tim hartford financial times columnist of course the name is something of an oxymoron there is really nothing modern about this monetary theory confusing money creation with wealth creation was at the core of the debate between john law and richard cantillon 300 years ago for law a scot who fled british justice took refuge in france and within a few years managed to drive what was then the leading economic power of the day into near bankruptcy increases in the supply of money would lead to the employment of unused land and labor which in turn would lead to higher productivity meanwhile cantillon explained in his essay on commerce that mistaking money for wealth always leads to disaster charles gave evergreen gavekal editor s note at the risk of sounding cynical it would not be difficult to imagine the federal reserve make that the world central banks proceeding with some version of mmt even while railing against it and saying they would never engage in such a thing how far from mmt was quantitative easing not far we would venture in modern times the lessons of zimbabwe and venezuela point to the catastrophic effects that can follow when a corrupt or incompetent government finances its lavish spending by printing more of its currency the gold standard favors the countries that have gold deposits but it has the advantage of making it difficult for governments to inflate prices by expanding the money supply it engenders long term price stability because the money supply can only grow at the rate at which gold is produced inflation can come though if a major new source of gold is developed as happened with spanish gold from the new world or with various gold rushes adam smith institute a word on

the international monetary fund imf on tuesday lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3 3 percent in the newly released world economic outlook weo report down 0 2 percentage point from its estimation in january the imf said the world economy faces downside risks brought by potential uncertainties in the ongoing global trade tensions as well as other country and sector specific factors global growth forecasts the 3 3 percent projection for 2019 is 0 3 percentage point below the 2018 figure followed by an expected return to 3 6 percent in 2020 growth rate projections for advanced economies are 1 8 percent for 2019 and 1 7 percent for 2020 both below the 2 percent plus rates recorded in the previous two years according to the weo report for emerging market and developing economies the imf predicted a growth rate down to 4 4 percent for 2019 0 1 percentage point lower than in 2018 and that expansion will rebound to a rate of 4 8 percent in 2020 leveling the 2017 outcome imf chief economist gita gopinath wrote in a blog post that the projected slowdown in 2019 is broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia gopinath said the loss of growth momentum said gopinath dates back to the second half of 2018 when the world economy was hit by a significantly weakened global expansion the weo report said global growth remained strong at 3 8 percent in the first half of 2018 but dropped to 3 2 percent in the second half gopinath blamed the situation largely on global trade tensions macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany and financial tightening alongside normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies with respect to the perceived recovery in 2020 the economist said it is precarious adding that it is based on the assumption that a rebound occurs in emerging market and developing economies gopinath said the uptick is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential she also cited a shift toward a more accommodative stance in central bank policies of the united states the european union eu japan and britain plus china ramping up its fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as a positive outlook for a u s china agreement to resolve their trade disputes these policy responses gopinath said have helped reverse the tightening financial conditions to varying degrees across countries featuring ongoing trends in the emerging markets such as a resumption of portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the u s dollar gopinath told a news conference tuesday that monetary policy space varies across different countries and for many advanced economies it remains limited we would expect to see unconventional monetary policy tools being used for instance in the euro area she said adding that inflation pressure staying low is a plus that will make even more accommodative monetary policy possible beyond 2020 the report predicted that global growth will plateau at about 3 6 percent over the medium term region specific projections the weo report expected growth rates in the euro zone to be 1 3 percent in 2019 and 1 5 percent in 2020 both lower than the 2018 and 2017 results eu wide downside risks include a protracted period of elevated bond yields in italy that would weigh on economic activity and worsen debt dynamics the rising possibility of britain leaving the eu without a deal as well as european parliamentary election outcomes that delay or reverse progress on strengthening the euro area architecture according to the report a no deal brexit that severely disrupts supply chains and raises trade costs could potentially have large and long lasting negative impacts on the economic well being of the united kingdom and the european union said the report asked at the press conference to comment on the state of the italian economy gopinath said the european country s growth in the second half of 2018 was particularly weak and that weakness carried over into 2019 high levels of debt as well as sovereign borrowing costs will be reflected in weaker investment and will remain concerns for italy especially given that growth in italy is weak not just in real terms but in nominal terms she said with regard to the united states it projected that the economy will grow by 2 3 percent in 2019 and expand at a lower rate of 1 9 percent in 2020 the report said the market implied path of expected policy rates remains below the u s federal reserve s projections raising the possibility of a market reassessment of the expected policy path if u s economic data remain strong this could result in higher u s interest rates renewed dollar appreciation and tighter financial conditions for emerging market and developing economies with balance sheet vulnerabilities the report said for china the growth rate is forecast to be 6 3 percent in 2019 up 0 1 percentage point from its previous estimation in january the chinese economy is forecast to expand by 6 1 percent in 2020 the post 2020 growth stabilization gopinath said is bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent with emerging economies in asia continuing to grow faster than other regions she added to prevent the downside risks from materializing gopinath urged the building of more inclusive economies adding that costly policy mistakes should be avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment she said across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience enditem

companies helped the market recoup some of its losses from a day earlier small company stocks also stood out beating the rest of the market banks retailers and homebuilders also notched gains utilities were the biggest laggard investors appeared to welcome new insights from the federal reserve s last meeting of policymakers the central bank released the minutes from the two day march meeting which showed that a majority of fed officials believed the central bank could keep interest rates unchanged the rest of this year the rally was a reversal for the market following a slide on tuesday that ended an eight day winning streak as investors turned their attention to the next wave of corporate earnings it was just a little bit of an overreaction yesterday said karyn cavanaugh

forecasts for the remainder of the 2019 earnings are going to really be the barometer for what s going on with global growth cavanaugh said a lot of people are expecting negative earnings growth i think we re going to be positively surprised and that will help investors feel a little bit more at ease investors also pored over the latest fed meeting minutes looking for clues that might signal the central bank s next move on interest rates the minutes showed that a majority of fed officials last month believed that economic conditions would likely warrant keeping the fed s benchmark policy unchanged for the rest of this year several officials said their view could shift in either direction based on incoming data according to minutes of the meeting at the meeting the fed left its key policy rate unchanged and trimmed its rate hikes outlook this year from two to none some economists believe the fed could actually start cutting rates later this year if the economy slows further weaker growth and lower inflation expectations could prompt the fed to cut rates while faster growth and rising inflation expectations could prompt it to resume raising rates this is a data dependent fed and that s very positive and very good said tony roth chief investment officer at wilmington trust meanwhile the european central bank left its policy goals and interest rates unchanged wednesday

millions but thanks to appearances on the joe rogan experience and the breakfast club one a hugely popular podcast and the other a highly rated radio show both with diverse audiences the political newcomer gained traction and a large following across social media seemingly overnight and since then yang has made multiple appearances on fox news and on conservative commentator ben shapiro s podcast neither of which are usually frequented by democratic presidential contenders those appearances helped expose yang to audiences who might not have otherwise heard of him namely the so called meme masters of reddit 4chan and other forums this unexpected windfall of contributions driven almost entirely by the internet which no other 2020 candidate has experienced helped yang secure the

structural reforms to american democracy in a book set for publication this fall ezra levin and leah greenberg who founded the activist group indivisible in 2017 plan to outline a vision for the future of liberal organizing that goes beyond simply fighting president donald trump in their book we are indivisible they aim to zero in on issues such as the overhaul of senate rules which they see as necessary to achieve the sort of big policy shifts that democratic presidential candidates are campaigning on odd structural reforms that have nothing to do with capital class power or heck even identity politics meeting needs the philly childcare collective pcc is a group of activists that provide free childcare to racial and economic justice groups in philadelphia their system is similar to that of other radical childcare collectives coordinators offer free childcare trainings for those who want to support movements throughout the city by caring for kids during meetings trainings and events social reproduction is often forgotten along with the people who perform it this forgetting has serious political consequences political meetings rely upon social reproductive labor washing dishes caring for children feeding participants but the meeting itself also presents a reproductive challenge how do participants sit in what sequence do they speak how do they address one another the stakes of these questions are high and can ultimately sustain or destroy us these sorts of high stakes are why silvia federici lifts up movements that place at the center of their political project the restructuring of reproduction as the crucial terrain for the transformation of social relations such efforts are to me a better use for dsa resources than electoral politics go out and serve the

the biosphere the trouble with the urban farming revolution original the rise of commercial controlled environment agriculture cea comprised of large scale rooftop farms vertical and indoor farms is a bid to re envision cities as places where we could produce food more sustainably in the future the predominantly grown foods such as lettuce aren t of great nutritional value for the urban population especially those threatened by food insecurity most produce from ceas is sold at a premium something that partly reflects the cost of the real estate used to grow the food consequently that produce is typically grown for high end food stores and restaurants meaning it s unlikely to reach low income urban populations who need it most the researchers also think it s unlikely that cea which currently occupies just 3 09 acres in new york city could expand into the roughly 1 864 acres they estimate is still suitable for urban farming in new york city supermarkets in thailand and vietnam swap plastic

which the area is famous for visible from space the intensive agriculture of almería is the largest of its kind reportedly producing over half of europe s fruit and vegetables food exports from the greenhouses were valued at 1 4 billion in 2012 with such a wealth of worrying yet impressive figures it s easy to overlook the people behind them not those at the top of the chain reaping the rewards of this gigantic harvest but the ones at the bottom toiling in the fields for a pittance working in temperatures of up to 45 degrees the labourers that keep the farms running are paid as little as 30

student loan delinquency on total sex and age specific suicide rates during the great recession the results of the present study found one aspect of the great recession student loan delinquency contributed to higher suicide rates in the united states the results support past research that showed economic indicators such as financial debt and foreclosure was associated with negative mental health outcomes the results of the present study suggest that increasing student loan delinquency during the great recession increased the total male age 20 24 and age 35 44 suicide rates within states but had no effect on any type of suicide between states thus unobserved factors not related to variables in the statistical models are needed to explain differences in suicide rates between states examples of these factors could be gun availability culture and protective resources related to mental health treatment nonetheless the results reported in this study support past theoretical and empirical studies that explain suicide rates as a function of economic frustration related to the inability to achieve desired social and economic outcomes durkheim 1951 henry and short 1954 yang

loughlin and other parents who are now facing the additional money laundering conspiracy charge are definitely feeling the weight of the government and the mounting pressure to plead guilty or

of big money investors in mobile homes has led to a corresponding spike in rents fees and other costs oliver said high interest financing by leading manufactured home seller clayton homes controlled by warren buffett but advertised by duck dynasty s phil robertson is one reason mobile homes are a great investment for big investors and a lousy one for buyers oliver said but it s not the only

dynasty yuck news of the wired a realist takes on quantum mechanics like einstein smolin is a philosophical realist someone who thinks that the real world exists independently of our minds and can be described by deterministic laws this view of the world is incompatible with the conventional interpretation of quantum mechanics in which key features are unpredictability and the role of observers in the outcome of experiments thus einstein never accepted that quantum mechanics was anything but an impressive placeholder for a more fundamental theory conforming to his realist credo smolin agrees one thing on which every physicist in smolin s field can agree is that there is a crying need for more juicy clues from nature there have been no surprises concerning the inner workings of atoms for

most democratic presidential candidates pushed by bernie sanders are proposing big new spending programs like medicare for all or a new child tax credit the party s traditional deficit phobia seems to be fading over time moderate democrats don t like this one bit so rep ben mcadams utah with the 27 member blue dog caucus has a replacement proposal it s not only bad it s of the most blisteringly stupid ideas out of the republican policy playbook a balanced budget amendment to the constitution it doesn t bode well for the blue dogs political future during the obama years republicans routinely pushed bills advancing a balanced budget amendment any economist with a quarter of a brain from conservatives to socialists responded that a strict no borrowing requirement would instantly create a shattering recession and crash the global economy federal borrowing props up demand both inside the u s and in all countries that export to it a huge dose of austerity to balance the budget would

get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up meanwhile u s treasury bonds are the foundation of the international finance system because the dollar is the world s major reserve currency foreign countries need dollar assets to settle their international accounts and u s debt is the safest one out there that s mostly why almost every foreign country has at least some holdings of american debt until something comes along to replace it perhaps the chinese renminbi or keynesian bancor the dollar s status as reserve currency gives america an advantage of cheaper borrowing even with the ballooning trump deficits government interest payments as a share of gdp are a mere 1 59 percent about half what they were in the 90s but it s one which must be maintained by continuing to supply dollar assets it s even idiotic if you accept the moronic governments are like a household canard households don t always balance their budgets sometimes they you know take out loans to buy a car a house or get through a rough patch now the republican proposals were 100 percent bad faith trolling when they got power in 2017 they instantly pushed for a gigantic tax cut for the rich that exploded the deficit just like they did when george w bush became president and to be fair mcadams proposed amendment would not be so draconian as the fake republican versions it would contain exceptions for war recessions and also protect social security and medicare from cuts given that the u s is in a seemingly endless war on terrorism and war spending plus social security and medicare make up about 55 percent of the federal budget it s unclear what this would mean in practice still the results could be disastrous medicaid is pointedly not included among protected programs and neither are food stamps refundable portions of the earned income tax credit and child tax credit nor sundry other programs to help the middle class and poor depending on how the amendment is designed these programs which are popular in addition to being vitally important for many families might get gored but the political background here is perhaps the most jaw droppingly stupid part of the whole mess this sort of austerity mania is the single biggest reason the democrats got swept out of congress in the 2010 midterms centrist democrats and obama himself pivoted to deficit reduction by early 2010 abandoning stimulus to create jobs while unemployment was still about 10 percent the result was crushing defeat especially for the blue dogs themselves who lost 22 of their 46 seats at least this time the blue dogs have included an exception for recessions but if they aren t convinced by the stone obvious arguments that austerity is bad policy one would think that losing their seats en masse directly because of austerity might lead them to rethink things but nope they ve learned nothing and forgotten everything mcadams complains that in my district fiscal responsibility matters it doesn t actually people care about their political goals and concrete material circumstances people will say they re worried about the deficit but as greg sargent notes at the washington post president trump has blown it sky high and still gets 58 percent approval on the economy because unemployment is low and wages are growing and insofar as people express concern about the deficit it s because of generations of well funded propaganda and endless scaremongering from the so called nonpartisan media even gallup has long been running what amount to pro austerity push polls in which the deficit is presumed to be a major problem the blue dogs need to either learn a few of the economic lessons of the last decade or be replaced by candidates who have
jerusalem the united states formally designated iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc as a foreign terrorist organization fto on monday making it the first state institution to be given the classification the decision to target the irgc is the next step for the trump administration s campaign to pressure the iranian regime to comply with international norms and to stop exporting its terrorism across the world the irgc connection to terrorism is irrefutable the 125 000 strong military unit operates alongside the official iranian military answering directly to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei it readily boasts about its sponsorship of hezbollah iraqi militias and yemen s houthis while the iranian economy falters iran spends over a billion dollars a year to fund terrorism across the world last week the united states revealed that from 2004 to 2011 the irgc was behind the deaths of 608 american servicemen in iraq the u s has long classified iran as the largest state sponsor of terrorism by imposing sanctions the u s is backing up its words with concrete actions now the u s government has formally recognized that a key part of iran s military is legally indistinguishable from the terrorist groups it has been sponsoring for decades wrote eli lake for bloomberg trump s strategy unlike his predecessor s begins with the premise that iran is an outlaw state and treats it as such until it changes its behavior the statement from president donald trump also gave a clear warning to those that would do business with the irgc this designation will be the first time that the united states has ever named a part of another government as an fto it underscores the fact that iran s actions are fundamentally different from those of other governments this action will significantly expand the scope and scale of our maximum pressure on the iranian regime it makes crystal clear the risks of conducting business with or providing support to the irgc if you are doing business with the irgc you will be bankrolling terrorism in effect this means the u s can target with secondary sanctions any entity that does business with the irgc which is charged with the regime s protection in november 2018 strict financial sanctions were placed on critical areas of the iranian economy such as banking and hydrocarbons the new sanctions will target any of the other sectors where irgc officials are involved outside observers rarely understand that the irgc is far more than just a military unit it also controls large swathes of the iranian economy so much so that dr saeed ghasseminejad wrote on april 9 that the irgc is not just guarding the regime the guard is the regime he continued in the past 10 years the irgc has had between 15 percent and 25 percent of iran s stock market under its control either independently or along with other military institutions in the non publicly traded segments of the economy it has a presence in nearly every profitable and strategic field from energy and construction to food and clothing as ghasseminejad noted the irgc has aggressively bought up former private companies for the past 15 years in 2005 khamenei privatized national industries in the banking shipping and telecommunication sectors these were immediately bought up by irgc or irgc affiliated companies ghasseminejad continued three major holdings affiliated with the guard intervened in iran s economy the irgc cooperative foundation the basij cooperative foundation and khatam al anbiya construction on paper the irgc cooperative foundation and the basij cooperative foundation both of which are tax exempt were formed to provide a range of social services to irgc and basij members such as housing loans health and education in practice both foundations have become the largest economic cartels in the country khatam al anbiya construction which is in charge of irgc construction projects has become iran s largest contractor right now the irgc or irgc affiliated institutions are at the helm of the largest construction company in iran and the largest telecommunications company in iran it also runs major airports in the country and much of the banking sector any international entity doing business with these irgc companies will now incur u s financial sanctions as chief executive of the foundation of defense of democracies mark dubowitz said the designation will make the irgc even more financially toxic than it already is this then has the potential to bleed the coffers of the irgc and with it the money needed to preserve the regime internally and its close ties to proxy organizations elsewhere for years those proxies have been designated with fto status but somehow the organization that sponsors and directs those proxies evaded such designation as a terrorist but no more with this decision the u s is finally acknowledging that the iranian regime is the head of the terrorist snake but will the designation and forthcoming sanctions have an effect at moderating iran that seems unlikely given iran s long term dedication to the cause of the islamic revolution also bible prophecy states clearly that iran will not change its behavior nevertheless there is evidence that this decision will severely impact iran s ability to project its power through its proxies especially in lebanon and syria syria s fateful decision designating the irgc as a terrorist organization puts the syrian regime in an increasingly difficult position as recently as last week iran signed numerous business agreements with the syrian government these lucrative contracts are part of syrian president bashar assad s payment to the regime for fighting to preserve his presidency they included the construction of a massive power plant rehabilitation projects in the ports of tartus and latakia as well as a dozen other projects in the oil and agricultural sectors this is in addition to running syria s telecommunications system most of these contracts have been awarded to iranian companies either run by the irgc or affiliated with the irgc in 2017 irgc leader maj gen mohammed ali jafari revealed that the organization would fully spearhead syria s reconstruction based on meetings held in the government it was decided that this mission should be assigned to sepah because of the security situation in syria the general said according to a tasnim report before the irgc was designated as a terrorist entity the syrian regime and other companies associated with the irgc reconstruction would not have suffered the wrath of secondary sanctions from the u s you could argue that given syria s pariah status and the sanctions already leveled on it by the u s these added sanctions would have little effect that might be true in the short term but in the long term syria wants to rebuild and rejoin the international community as long as it is wedded to the irgc that will not be possible this just adds to the list of reasons why syria may choose to break away from iran lebanon too the last foreign stop u s secretary of state mike pompeo made before this announcement was in lebanon pompeo told leading lebanese politicians allied with hezbollah an irgc surrogate that they too could be targeted with the upcoming sanctions while in lebanon pompeo had said that the u s is inclined to sanction political individuals linked to hezbollah to curtail the group s military and political growth and in effect the influence of its patron iran in the region al jazeera reported it makes sense that if the irgc now officially labeled as a terrorist organization is funding hezbollah another terrorist organization and other lebanese politicians are in an alliance with hezbollah then they too would face secondary sanctions it only makes sense to sanction the lebanese government if it is in cahoots with hezbollah since it is basically the lebanese version of the irgc apparently pompeo told lebanon s speaker of the house and its president that they are on the shortlist to be sanctioned unless they pull the reins on hezbollah hanin ghaddar a visiting fellow at the washington institute for near east policy told al jazeera the fact that the u s warned the lebanese government and that it has given it some time to act shows that pompeo believes it s possible to sideline hezbollah politically in lebanon such would be an unparalleled victory for the u s in its iranian policy what bible prophecy says it s possible that mr trump s stronger iran policy will actually bring about the fulfillment of bible prophecy while the bible indicates iran will stay on its hegemonic course it also indicates that iran will lose control of both syria and lebanon for more than 25 years we have explained that iran leads the biblical king of the south mentioned in daniel 11 40 this islamist alliance will include iraq as well as nations along the western coastline of the red sea and the southern mediterranean including egypt ethiopia eritrea and libya note however that syria and lebanon are not listed in this prophesied iran led alliance instead syria is grouped in the other alliance of middle eastern nations described in psalm 83 for they have consulted together with one consent they are confederate against thee the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the hagarenes gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines with the inhabitants of tyre assur also is joined with them verses 5 8 as any bible commentary will tell you an alliance of these countries has never existed in history this alliance between certain middle eastern nations and germany assur will develop in the end time one of the nations mentioned the hagarenes corresponds to modern syria in many ways the psalm 83 alliance is an anti iranian alliance based on these end time prophecies we have forecast for two decades that syria s alliance with iran is destined to end but given how critical syria is to iran for establishing the shia crescent it also seems that losing it will affect iran s ability to maintain control in lebanon and its access to the eastern mediterranean lebanon specifically southern lebanon where iran currently has much support through hezbollah is also destined to be part of the psalm 83 alliance not the iranian led king of the south president trump s current policy of striking at the head of the terrorist snake could lead to both syria and lebanon choosing to throw off their iranian patronage for more on our long standing forecast for iran please read the king of the south

of the spring meetings which will be followed by a fund staff mission s visit to islamabad in the third week of the current month to formally sign the agreement finance ministry s spokesperson was not available for comment but information minister fawad chaudhry said that mr umar is currently in washington to hold talks with imf to negotiate terms of agreement which he said are in the final stages but another round of talks will be held in a few days in which the loaning plan will be finalised he added that the tax amnesty scheme will be formally launched after the finance minister s return to islamabad expects menap region growth at 1 5pc in 2019 and 3 2pc by 2020 in its flagship world economic outlook weo the imf projects mid term growth prospects for pakistan to remain subdued at 2 5pc by 2024 the next year growth rate forecast by the fund was generally in line with 2 7pc growth projected by the world bank a day earlier however the wb had forecast 3 6pc growth for the current fiscal year compared to 2 9pc estimated by the imf read more pakistan s gdp growth to shrink to 3 4pc this fiscal world bank the fund attributed negative outlook to fuel prices and macroeconomic challenges and the impact of the slowdown in global economy the fund projected consumer price index in pakistan at 7 6pc during the current fiscal year slowing down to 7pc next fiscal year and then stabilising to 5pc by 2024 on the other hand pakistan s current account deficit was estimated at 5 2pc of the gdp during the current year falling to 4 3pc next year before surging again to 5 4pc by 2024 yet the unemployment rate was anticipated to stay largely flat at 6 1pc during the current year 6 2pc next year and remain in the same band by 2024 the government has already shared its stabilisation and growth strategy along with all the macroeconomic data with the imf that is believed to have become the basis of pakistan s economic outlook over the programme period and beyond growth in menap region to remain subdued the weo notes that the medium term outlook for the middle east north africa afghanistan and pakistan menap region was largely shaped by the outlook for fuel prices needed adjustment to correct macroeconomic imbalances in certain economies and geopolitical tensions in pakistan in the absence of further adjustment policies growth is projected to remain subdued at about 2 5pc with continued external and fiscal imbalances weighing on confidence the imf said elsewhere in the region activity is weighed down by the expected impact of sanctions in iran civil strife in syria and yemen and rising debt service costs and tighter financial conditions in lebanon the report explained that growth in menap region was expected to decline to 1 5pc in 2019 before recovering to about 3 2pc by 2020 the outlook for the region is weighed down by multiple factors including slower gdp growth in saudi arabia ongoing macroeconomic adjustment challenges in pakistan us sanctions in iran and civil tensions and conflict across several other economies including iraq syria and yemen where recovery from the collapse associated with the war is now expected to be slower than previously anticipated convergence prospects are bleak for some emerging market and developing economies across sub saharan africa and the menap region 41 economies accounting for around 10pc of the global gdp in purchasing power parity terms and close to one billion in population are projected to grow by less than advanced economies in per capita terms over the next five years implying that their income levels are set to fall further behind those economies higher oil prices have been the main driver of this widening income gaps estimated to have boosted the current account balance of oil exporters by about 3 5pc of their gdp symmetrically the current account deficits of some asian net oil importers such as india indonesia and pakistan have widened reflecting their higher oil import bills among major current account surplus and deficit countries and regions the current account surplus of china declined considerably to 0 4pc of gdp while the us current account deficit is unchanged at 2 3pc and the surplus of the euro area declined marginally to 3pc the report said escalation of us china trade tensions macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany tighter credit policies in china and financial tightening alongside the normalisation of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half of 2018 caused a slower than projected global growth as a result the global economy would grow by just 3 3pc compared to earlier projections of 3 9pc published in dawn april 10th 2019
tobias adrian financial counsellor at the international monetary fund imf said that the markets sold off sharply late last year broadly across asset cases amid growing signs of a slowing global economy and rising concerns about the us china trade tensions adrian added against a backdrop of rising downside risks policymakers across the globe took steps to prevent a sharper deceleration of the economy such a forceful response supported market sentiment and triggered a sharp rebound in risk assets despite this recent improvement financial markets remain susceptible to a sudden tightening in financial conditions adrian pointed out that an abrupt deterioration in financial conditions could unmask financial fragilities that have built during the period of very low interest rates explaining that in the current issue of the global financial stability report gfsr a more structured and systematic approach to monitoring financial vulnerability across regions and economic sectors is introduced he elaborated that financial conditions have tightened since the october 2018 gfsr but remain relatively accommodative notably in the united states after a sharp decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 financial markets rebounded strongly in early 2019 on growing optimism about the us china trade negotiations as major central banks adopted more patient and flexible approaches to monetary policy normalisation moreover the gfsr said that the debt service capacity has improved in most advanced economies and balance sheets appear strong enough to sustain a moderate economic slowdown or gradual tightening financial risk taking have increased and the creditworthiness of some borrowers has deteriorated adrian remarked that portfolio flows to emerging markets are increasingly influenced by benchmark indices however emerging market bonds have quadrupled in the past 10 years to 800bn the gfsr s estimates also suggest that 70 of country allocations of investment funds are influenced by benchmark indices moreover the report has highlighted the issue of house s price spikes noting that the recent rapid increase in house prices in many countries has raised concerns about the possibility of a price correction he disclosed that a lower house price momentum overvaluation excessive credit growth and tighter financial conditions help predict downside risk to house prices up to three years ahead adrian called on policymakers to communicate any reassessment of the monetary policy stance that reflects either changes in the economic outlook or unduly compressed market volatility additionally he called on them to deploy prudential tools or expand their macroprudential toolkits where needed in response to daily news egypt s question adrian said that house prices hiked in egypt due to the devaluation of egypt s local currency and inflation rates increases which participated directly in the spike of house prices of the country he noted that that once the inflation rates decline and achieving financial stability price corrections will take place he further noted that large house price declines can adversely affect macroeconomic performance and financial stability as seen during the global financial crisis of 2008 and other historical episodes these macro financial links arise from the many roles housing plays for households small firms and for financial intermediaries as a consumption good long term investment store of wealth and a collateral for lending among others in this context the rapid increase in house prices in many countries in recent years has raised some concerns about the possibility of a decline and its potential consequences adrian noted adding we call on policymakers to look at financial risks on the short term and the long term

the projected growth rate for next year was unchanged at 3 6 per cent more than two thirds of the expected slowdown in 2019 stems from troubles in rich nations including members of the eu in this context avoiding policy missteps that could harm economic activity should be the main priority the imf said its report one potential misstep lies in britain s indecision over how to leave the eu despite looming deadlines london has not decided how it will try to shield its economy during the exit process the imf s new forecast assumes an orderly brexit but the fund said a chaotic process could shave more than 0 2 percentage points from global growth in 2019 it said the bank of england should be cautious on its interest rate policy an apparent tip to wait before hiking borrowing costs the eu s economic growth is already slowing substantially though the imf said it still expects the slowdown in europe and some emerging market economies will give way to a re acceleration in growth during the second half of 2019 the outlook for germany one of the main drivers of european growth suffered from weaker demand for its exports softer consumer spending and new emissions standards that have depressed car sales germany may have to quickly turn to fiscal stimulus measures the imf said also calling on the european central bank to keep stimulating the regional economy the imf also cut japan s growth outlook following a string of natural disasters the us economy while seen outperforming other rich nations economies also got a downgrade on signs that a fiscal stimulus fuelled by tax cuts was producing less activity than previously expected us treasury yields slid on concerns about the global economic outlook which also weighed on us stocks the s p 500 index was off about 0 4 per cent and the dow jones industrial average was down about 0 6 per cent china s green shoots the imf said it supported the us federal reserve s decision to pause its rate hiking cycle which the global lender said would support the us and world economies this year by easing financial conditions the imf raised its forecast for us growth in 2020 by a tenth of a percentage point to 1 9 per cent the global lender said it was slightly boosting its outlook for chinese growth this year to 6 3 per cent in part because an expected escalation in the us china trade war had not materialised still america s ongoing tensions with china and other major trading partners continue to cloud the global economy
the world bank has warned that the nigerian economy has been slipping since 1995 and this continued till 2018 the bank in its latest report yesterday on the regional economy titled africa s pulse released the taxonomy of growth performance in sub saharan africa which focused on the macroeconomic and financial features that led to growth resilience on the continent according to the bank the taxonomy is used to help identify the factors that are correlated with success or failure in economic growth performance in sub saharan africa with emphasis on macroeconomic and financial variables the analysis it said involved a series of macroeconomic variables for 44 sub saharan african countries from 1995 to 2018 the key elements that determined the positions of each of the 44 sub saharan economies in the taxonomy the world bank said included the level of income per capita of the countries structural transformation as captured by sectoral value added share and sectoral employment share and capital flows others are level and composition of public sector indebtedness as captured by the general government gross debt and its currency composition and the outstanding external public debt the last of the indicators has to do with governance vis a vis government effectiveness regulatory quality control of corruption voice and accountability political stability and absence of violence and rule of law according to the world bank the taxonomy compares the average annual gdp growth rates during 1995 2008 and 2015 2018 against predetermined thresholds it also categorised growth performance into five groups falling behind slipping stuck in the middle improved and established the five groups were further reclassified into three groups top tercile middle tercile and bottom tercile the bretton wood institution said if a country s economic performance declined from 1995 2008 to 2015 18 the country is categorised in the bottom tercile which includes falling behind and slipping if a country s growth rate remained invariant over time between 3 5 and 5 4 per cent in both periods it is categorised in the middle tercile or stuck in the middle if a country s economic performance improved from 1995 2008 to 2015 18 with the growth of more than 5 4 per cent per year the country is categorised in the top tercile which includes the improved and established groups based on the above classification the nigerian economy was categorised alongside 18 other sub saharan african economies as slipping having recorded declined economic performance between 1995 and 2018 the world bank said the bottom tercile consists of 19 countries angola burundi botswana the republic of congo the comoros gabon equatorial guinea liberia lesotho mauritania malawi namibia nigeria sierra leone eswatini chad south africa zambia and zimbabwe these countries did not show any progress in their economic performance from 1995 2008 to 2015 18 for instance their median economic growth rate decelerated from 5 4 per cent per year in 1995 2008 to 1 2 per cent per year in 2015 18 the bottom performing economies according to the world bank produce almost 60 per cent of the region s total gdp emphasising that the three largest countries in the region nigeria south africa and angola and many commodity exporters are in this group burkina faso côte d ivoire ethiopia ghana guinea guinea bissau kenya mali rwanda senegal and tanzania made the top tercile the middle tercile countries are benin the central african republic cameroon the democratic republic of congo cabo verde the gambia madagascar mozambique mauritius niger sudan sao tomé and príncipe togo and uganda the world bank also cut its growth forecast for sub saharan africa this year to 2 8 per cent from an initial 3 3 per cent the commodity price slump of 2015 cut short a decade of rapid growth for the region and the bank said growth would take longer to recover as a decline in industrial production and a trade dispute between china and the united states take their toll the bank s 2019 forecast means economic growth will lag population growth for the fourth year in a row and it will remain stuck below three per cent which it slipped to in 2015 the slower than expected overall growth reflects ongoing global uncertainty but increasingly comes from domestic macroeconomic instability including poorly managed debt inflation and deficits the bank said the bretton wood institution equally cut nigeria s growth forecast by 0 1 per cent it said growth in nigeria is projected to rise from 1 9 per cent in 2018 to 2 1 per cent in 2019 0 1 percentage point lower than last october s forecast this modest expansion reflects stagnant oil production as regulatory uncertainty limits investment in the oil sector while non oil economic activity is held back by high inflation policy distortions and infrastructure constraints growth is projected to rise slightly to 2 2 per cent in 2020 and reach 2 4 per cent in 2021 as improving financing conditions help boost investment in nigeria although the manufacturing and non manufacturing pmis remained above the neutral 50 point mark which denotes expansion they fell further in february due to weaker rises in output and new sales orders across firms household consumption in nigeria has remained subdued while multiple exchange rates foreign exchange restrictions low private sector credit growth and infrastructure constraints have continued to weigh on private investment the chief economist for africa at the bank albert zeufack said the region could boost annual growth by about nearly two percentage points if it harnessed information technology more effectively this is a game changer for africa he added however the spokesperson for the central bank of nigeria mr isaac okorafor said the cbn under the current governor mr godwin emefiele had shown so much ingenuity in managing the economy you know the crisis that we have faced in the past three years the bank has shown ingenuity in managing the situation and ensuring that everything is stable meanwhile the minister of finance mrs zainab ahmed and the governor central bank of nigeria mr godwin emefiele have joined other economic experts from around the world to discuss issues affecting global economy in washington dc us the discussions are scheduled to hold between april 9 and april 14 under the auspices of the world bank group and the international monetary fund in washington dc the 2019 spring meetings of the imf and the world bank is expected to bring together central bank governors ministers of finance parliamentarians private sector executives representatives from civil society organisations and the academia the experts will discuss issues of global concern including the world economic outlook poverty eradication economic development and aid effectiveness the meeting will also feature seminars regional briefings press conferences and many other events with focus on global economy international development and the world s financial system nigeria attends the meeting each year because of the quantum of investments and technical support it receives from both the imf and the world bank although nigeria currently has zero loans with the imf it enjoys technical support from the organisation the world bank group on the other hand is helping to fight poverty and improve living standards in the country through 33 core knowledge product reports and 29 ongoing national and regional projects meanwhile nigeria is still struggling with recent reports that ranked the country 6th among miserable people in the world the country has again scored another negative point with regards to its already battered health indices the country has again broken another unenviable record with the number of dementia cases growing by 400 per cent it would be recalled that dementia is a brain disorder that affects communication and performance of daily activities it is an umbrella term for a set of symptoms including impaired thinking and memory and often associated with the cognitive decline of ageing in nigeria sadly little or no attention is given to mental health disorders dementia victims are labelled witches or mentally derailed the level of awareness on mental health issues is poor and fraught with lots of misconceptions the culture of stigma and discrimination fuels access to care as mental disorders are linked to supernatural causes including witchcraft demonic possession and even punishment from gods or ancestors in this part of the world in most cases these patients are abandoned to their fate currently over seven million nigerians suffer from depression according to the world health organisation who 2015 estimates the same report estimates that west africa has about 4 8 million people with anxiety disorders these scary statistics may not be unconnected with the fact that nigerians are becoming more stressed due to economic hardship and other stressful life events nigeria is rated among top 10 countries that are over depressed and ranks among countries with the highest number of drug addicts depression and dementia among others statistics by who show that an estimated 47 5 million people have dementia and there are 7 7 million new cases every year developing countries like nigeria account for 57 7 percent of the problem according to the federal ministry of health about 20 30 per cent of nigerians suffer from mental illness the permanent secretary of the ministry of health abdulaziz abdullahi had at a mental health action committee and stakeholders workshop in abuja disclosed that with a population of about 200 million nigeria had a high rate of mental illness this implies that nigeria has about 60 million persons with mental illnesses however as nigeria battles with the mental disorders challenge with no policy on mental health in place a study by the journal of global health reports published by the university of edinburgh has revealed that dementia a clinical syndrome caused by neuro degeneration has increased astronomically in nigeria over the last two decades it is estimated that about 47 5 million people are living with dementia globally with over two thirds residing in low and middle income countries lmics including africa where there is very limited access to social protection and relevant care services and support this first national comprehensive study also revealed that several communities in nigeria still link dementia to a normal process of ageing with many patients stigmatised and abandoned in the belief that their condition is beyond any medical intervention thus many of those affected delay seeking medical care and endure poor outcomes however the situation is exacerbated by poor mental health service access which partly results in high out of pocket expenses that few can afford it has been estimated that the number of dementia cases increased by over 400 per cent over a 20 year period from 63 500 in 1995 to 318 000 in 2015 among persons aged 60 years prevalence was highest in north central followed by north west and south west while the prevalence was also higher in urban settings compared to rural settings alzheimer s disease one of the subtypes of dementia had the highest prevalence while other dementia subtypes had prevalence rates less of than 1 per cent in the views of the lead researcher the centre for global health research university of edinburgh dr davies adeloye some of the factors responsible for the prevalence of this disease include genetic cultural and nutritional variation in the country he urged the government to provide comprehensive care and support institutions for people living with dementia as this was currently lacking in the country adeloye advocated for a bill broadly focused on protecting the rights of individuals with mental disorders and setting standards for mental health practice in the country it is therefore important for policymakers to direct efforts at ensuring adequate infrastructure personnel training and research that focus on dementia among other important mental health needs in nigeria adeloye who noted that 318 000 persons were affected as at 2015 regretted said to prevent the disorder there is need for nigerians to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating a healthy balanced diet maintaining a healthy weight exercising regularly keeping alcohol to a minimum level stopping smoking and keeping blood pressure at a healthy level reacting to the findings a clinical psychologist lagos university teaching hospital dr juliet ottoh who also described dementia as a general term for a massive decline in mental ability said when is severe it can interfere with an individual s life activity she said lack of mentally stimulating activities not exercising and not eating healthy and balanced food could predispose an individual to dementia ottoh urged nigerians to quit smoking and embrace regular medical check up for early detection and treatment there are many different mental disorders with different presentations they are generally characterised by a combination of abnormal thoughts perceptions emotions behaviour and relationships with others mental disorders include depression bipolar affective disorder schizophrenia and other psychoses dementia intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders including autism stigma is a big problem in nigeria it prevents people from seeking treatment nobody wants to be seen entering a psychiatric hospital she counselled
عربي 中文 español français 日本語 português русский in the united states the ratio of corporate debt to gdp is at record high levels in several european countries banks are overloaded with government bonds in china bank profitability is declining and capital levels remain low at small and medium size lenders vulnerabilities like these are on the rise across advanced and emerging market economies according to the imf s latest global financial stability report they aren t all setting off alarm bells just yet but if they continue to build especially with still easy financial conditions they could amplify shocks to the global economy raising the odds of a severe economic downturn a few years down the road with the right mix of policies countries can sustain growth while keeping vulnerabilities in check this poses a dilemma for policymakers seeking to counter a slowing global economy as discussed in the world economic outlook by taking a patient approach to monetary policy central banks can accommodate growing downside risks to the economy but if financial conditions remain easy for too long vulnerabilities will continue to build and the odds of a sharp drop in economic growth at some later point will be higher the good news short term risks to global financial stability are still low by historical standards though they are slightly higher than we found in our october 2018 global financial stability report in the medium term however risks remain elevated but with the right mix of policies countries can sustain growth while keeping vulnerabilities in check why do we worry about financial vulnerabilities because they can amplify the impact of sudden shocks such as a sharper than anticipated economic slowdown an unexpected shift in monetary policy or an escalation of trade tensions higher vulnerabilities give rise to greater financial stability risks the latest global financial stability report introduces a way to quantify vulnerabilities in the financial system so policymakers can monitor them in real time and take preventive steps if needed to mitigate risks the framework encompasses six sectors corporates households governments banks insurance companies and other financial institutions some of which are what we call shadow banks the framework tracks both the level and the pace of change along a variety of vulnerabilities including leverage and mismatches in the maturity and liquidity of assets and liabilities as well as currency exposures these vulnerabilities are tracked at regional and global levels aggregating across 29 systemically important countries here are some of the most serious vulnerabilities advanced economies corporate debt and financial risk taking have increased and the creditworthiness of borrowers has deteriorated the stock of bonds with bbb ratings has quadrupled and the stock of speculative grade credits has almost doubled in the united states and the euro area since the crisis a sharp tightening of financial conditions or a severe downturn could make it harder for indebted firms to repay their loans and force them to cut back on investment or employment so called leveraged loans to highly indebted borrowers are an area of particular concern as we explained in an earlier blog and discuss further in the current gfsr euro area fiscal challenges in some countries could drive bond yields sharply higher resulting in significant losses for banks with large holdings of government debt insurance companies could also face losses this dynamic known as the sovereign financial sector nexus was at the heart of the euro crisis in 2011 still banks have higher capital ratios today and policymakers have taken steps to address nonperforming loans on banks balance sheets china a decline in profits and low levels of capital at small and medium sized banks is restraining credit to smaller private firms further monetary and credit support may increase financial stability risks as continued credit growth makes it harder for smaller banks to clean up their balance sheets emerging markets increasingly overseas portfolio investments in emerging markets are run by managers who seek to match the returns of popular indexes the value of fixed income benchmark driven investments has quadrupled in the past ten years to 800 billion while index driven funds expand the universe of investors for emerging market economies they also leave them more vulnerable to sudden reversals of capital flows in response global trends fortunately there are ways to address such vulnerabilities so called macroprudential tools can cool credit growth and make the financial system more resilient one example countercyclical capital buffers which require banks to increase capital when credit is growing countries with high corporate debt could develop tools to limit the riskiness of credit to firms especially credit provided by nonbank lenders in the euro zone lowering the debt to gdp ratio among highly indebted governments is a priority to curb risks so is further repairing banks balance sheets including by reducing non performing loans china needs to continue reducing leverage in the financial sector especially in shadow banking and ensure that lenders build capital buffers authorities should also promptly carry out announced reforms to address risks in investment products emerging market economies coping with volatile capital flows could limit reliance on short term overseas debt and ensure adequate foreign currency reserves and fiscal buffers countries can also use flexible exchange rates to absorb shocks in some circumstances countries with strong economies and inflation at or above target can also consider using monetary policy to lean against the wind with the right combination of policies countries can keep their economies humming while also limiting risks to financial stability
the central bank of egypt cbe said its basic interest rates and the inflation forecast have remained consistent with the bank s target downward trend of inflation the cbe explained in its fourth 2018 report on monetary policy issued on monday that its vision includes achieving the target rates of inflation of 9 3 in the fourth quarter of 2020 which was announced in december 2018 after the 13 3 target rate was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 which was announced in may 2017 the cbe expected the real gdp growth to continue increasing supported by structural reforms even though it was affected by the government measures to control the state s finances it added that an initial surplus of the state s general budget is expected to be 2 of the total gdp in fy 2018 19 compared to an expected surplus of 1 of the gdp in fy 2017 18 and a gdp deficit of 1 8 in fy 2016 17 according to the cbe the general budget deficit is expected to decline to 8 4 and 7 2 of the gdp in fys 2018 19 and 2019 20 respectively compared to 9 8 in fy 2017 18 and 10 9 in fy 2016 17 the overall deficit is expected to continue downwards the cbe noted that brent prices in the future outlook has remained without changes however global petroleum prices remain volatile the cbe expected the cost of the majority of petroleum products to be covered and the automated pricing mechanism to be activated in mid 2019 global prices of food products are also expected to stabilise at the same local consumption rates in 2019 before seeing an increase in 2020 it pointed out that in addition to the developing global prices of basic commodities the development in the economic activity and political and commercial tensions continued to form a risk alongside with the pace of constraining financial situations moreover the volume and timing of the possible measures to control the state s finances and inflation predictions also continued to pose a risk in terms of the local economy the cbe said that liquidity surplus in banks declined in december 2018 for the first time since december 2017 recording an average of egp 717 3bn an equivalent of 13 5 of the total gdp during the retention period ending in december 2018 the cbe also revealed that the rate of yields on new deposits remained relatively stable averaging 12 8 since april 2018 after falling as a result of the cumulative reduction in basic interest rates by 200 basis points in february and march 2018 at the same time the yield price on new loans rose slightly to 17 3 on average in october and november 2018 after falling to an average of 17 in the third quarter of 2018 the yield of government securities in local currency has stabilized at 15 8 since october 2018 after rising between may and september 2018 compared to 13 7 in april 2018 and an average of 14 6 in the fourth quarter of 2017 which is before the cbe reduced the basic yield prices the cbe said it added that the developments in the global financial markets had an impact on the return of government securities in local currency pointing out that this effect was stronger than the effect of the cumulative decline in the cbe s basic interest rates by 200 basis points in february and march 2018 the cbe said that real asset prices in egx continued to be affected by the selling operations in the stock exchanges of emerging markets however the dollar denominated egx30 index continued to outperform the dollar denominated msci index although it has fallen since june 2018 at the same time real estate unit prices remained stable after falling in some areas in cairo in the third quarter of 2018 for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2016 real gdp slightly softens egypt s real gdp growth slightly softened to 5 3 in the third quarter of 2018 after increasing for six consecutive quarters and stabilising in q2 of 2018 at 5 4 according to the report the report indicated that the decline in the contribution of investments to gdp has more than offset the improvement in that of net exports and by a lesser extent consumption meanwhile the unemployment rate inched up slightly to 10 0 in q3 of 2018 after declining for seven consecutive quarters furthermore the cbe report cites that economic growth of egypt s external environment is estimated to have continued to soften for the second consecutive quarter during q4 of 2018 registering 2 5 down from 2 7 in the previous quarter and from 3 2 in q7 of 2017 the highest pace since 2011 the cbe also cites that global economic as well as trade growth continued to slowdown international oil prices continued to decline and emerging markets witnessed net capital inflows for the first time since january 2018 economic growth in advanced economies is estimated to have continued to ease for the fourth consecutive quarter to register 1 5 in q4 of 2018 compared to 1 8 in q3 of 2018 as slower growth in the euro area the united kingdom and japan more than offset a stronger growth in the united states on the other hand economic growth in emerging economies continued to inch up registering 4 8 in q4 of 2018 maintaining continuous improvement between q4 of 2015 and q2 of 2018 higher growth in brazil and russia is more than offset slower growth in india and china compared to the previous quarter
islamabad as finance minister asad umar leads a delegation to washington to finalise a three year bailout programme the international monetary fund imf on tuesday forecast pakistan s growth to fall to 2 9 per cent and 2 8pc during the current and next fiscal year unless its programme was accepted the delegation led by finance minister including state bank of pakistan governor tariq bajwa finance secretary younas dagha economic affairs division secretary noor ahmed and senior officials from these institutions would attend the spring meetings april 9 14 of the imf and the world bank and finalise a bailout package to stabilise macroeconomic fundamentals on the sidelines before leaving for washington the minister had said the proposed imf programme would be finalised on the sidelines of the spring meetings which will be followed by a fund staff mission s visit to islamabad in the third week of the current month to formally sign the agreement finance ministry s spokesperson was not available for comment but information minister fawad chaudhry said that mr umar is currently in washington to hold talks with imf to negotiate terms of agreement which he said are in the final stages but another round of talks will be held in a few days in which the loaning plan will be finalised he added that the tax amnesty scheme will be formally launched after the finance minister s return to islamabad expects menap region growth at 1 5pc in 2019 and 3 2pc by 2020 in its flagship world economic outlook weo the imf projects mid term growth prospects for pakistan to remain subdued at 2 5pc by 2024 the next year growth rate forecast by the fund was generally in line with 2 7pc growth projected by the world bank a day earlier however the wb had forecast 3 6pc growth for the current fiscal year compared to 2 9pc estimated by the imf read more pakistan s gdp growth to shrink to 3 4pc this fiscal world bank the fund attributed negative outlook to fuel prices and macroeconomic challenges and the impact of the slowdown in global economy the fund projected consumer price index in pakistan at 7 6pc during the current fiscal year slowing down to 7pc next fiscal year and then stabilising to 5pc by 2024 on the other hand pakistan s current account deficit was estimated at 5 2pc of the gdp during the current year falling to 4 3pc next year before surging again to 5 4pc by 2024 yet the unemployment rate was anticipated to stay largely flat at 6 1pc during the current year 6 2pc next year and remain in the same band by 2024 the government has already shared its stabilisation and growth strategy along with all the macroeconomic data with the imf that is believed to have become the basis of pakistan s economic outlook over the programme period and beyond growth in menap region to remain subdued the weo notes that the medium term outlook for the middle east north africa afghanistan and pakistan menap region was largely shaped by the outlook for fuel prices needed adjustment to correct macroeconomic imbalances in certain economies and geopolitical tensions in pakistan in the absence of further adjustment policies growth is projected to remain subdued at about 2 5pc with continued external and fiscal imbalances weighing on confidence the imf said elsewhere in the region activity is weighed down by the expected impact of sanctions in iran civil strife in syria and yemen and rising debt service costs and tighter financial conditions in lebanon the report explained that growth in menap region was expected to decline to 1 5pc in 2019 before recovering to about 3 2pc by 2020 the outlook for the region is weighed down by multiple factors including slower gdp growth in saudi arabia ongoing macroeconomic adjustment challenges in pakistan us sanctions in iran and civil tensions and conflict across several other economies including iraq syria and yemen where recovery from the collapse associated with the war is now expected to be slower than previously anticipated convergence prospects are bleak for some emerging market and developing economies across sub saharan africa and the menap region 41 economies accounting for around 10pc of the global gdp in purchasing power parity terms and close to one billion in population are projected to grow by less than advanced economies in per capita terms over the next five years implying that their income levels are set to fall further behind those economies higher oil prices have been the main driver of this widening income gaps estimated to have boosted the current account balance of oil exporters by about 3 5pc of their gdp symmetrically the current account deficits of some asian net oil importers such as india indonesia and pakistan have widened reflecting their higher oil import bills among major current account surplus and deficit countries and regions the current account surplus of china declined considerably to 0 4pc of gdp while the us current account deficit is unchanged at 2 3pc and the surplus of the euro area declined marginally to 3pc the report said escalation of us china trade tensions macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany tighter credit policies in china and financial tightening alongside the normalisation of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half of 2018 caused a slower than projected global growth as a result the global economy would grow by just 3 3pc compared to earlier projections of 3 9pc published

washington dc the international monetary fund on tuesday warned that global economic growth was slowing more than expected and that a sharp downturn could require world leaders to coordinate stimulus measures the global lender cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2019 and said key risks included a us china trade war and a potentially disorderly british exit from the european union the imf said it still expects that a sharp slowdown in europe and some emerging market economies will give way to a general re acceleration in the second half of 2019 but chances of further cuts to the outlook are high the fund said in its world economic outlook report already some major economies including china and germany might need to take short term actions the imf said this is a delicate moment for the global economy imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a news conference gopinath said a sharp downturn might require synchronized fiscal stimulus across economies as well as loose monetary policy the imf and world bank are holding their spring meetings in washington this week in its third downgrade since october the imf said the global economy will likely grow 3 3 percent this year the slowest expansion since 2016 the forecast cut 0 2 percentage point from the imf s outlook in january the projected growth rate for next year was unchanged at 3 6 percent more than two thirds of the expected slowdown in 2019 owes to trouble in rich nations in this context avoiding policy missteps that could harm economic activity should be the main priority the imf said its report one potential misstep lies in britain s indecision over how to leave the eu despite looming deadlines london has not decided how it will try to shield its economy during the exit process the imf s new forecast assumes an orderly brexit but the fund said a chaotic process could shave more than 0 2 percentage points from global growth in 2019 the imf said the bank of england should be cautious on its interest rate policy an apparent tip to wait before hiking borrowing costs the eu s economic growth is already slowing substantially and the slowdown accounted for much of the reduction in the global growth forecast germany s outlook suffered from weaker demand for its exports softer consumer spending and new emissions standards that have depressed car sales germany may have to quickly turn to fiscal stimulus measures the imf said also calling on the european central bank to keep stimulating the regional economy the imf also cut japan s growth outlook following a string of natural disasters the us economy while seen outperforming other rich nations also got a downgrade on signs that a fiscal stimulus fueled by tax cuts was producing less activity than previously expected us treasury yields slid on concerns about the global economic outlook while the s p 500 index and the dow jones industrial index were down more than half a per cent amid worries that a u s threat to slap tariffs on hundreds of european goods would be a further economic drag boost from fed pause the imf said it supported the us federal reserve s decision to pause its rate hiking cycle which the global lender said would support the us and world economies this year by easing financial conditions the imf raised its forecast for u s growth in 2020 by a tenth of a percentage point to 1 9 percent the global lender said it was slightly boosting its outlook for chinese growth this year to 6 3 percent in part because an expected escalation in the u s china trade war did not materialize still america s ongoing tensions with china and other major trading partners remain a risk for the global economy us tariffs on chinese imports are hitting chinese growth and also weighing on latin america and other areas dependent on chinese demand for commodities in a world economic outlook chapter released last week the imf said an escalation of the us china trade war would drive manufacturing away from both countries and cause job losses but would do little to change their total trade balances if 25 percent tariffs were imposed on all trade between the world s two largest economies us gdp would fall by up to 0 6 percent and china s would fall by up to 1 5 percent the imf said the imf also cut its 2019 growth forecasts for canada and latin america as well as for the middle east and north african countries china was trying to rebalance its massive economy away from investment and exports when u s president donald trump ordered higher tariffs on chinese imports beginning in 2018 china responded with retaliatory tariffs on us goods in an ominous sign the imf said beijing might need to unleash fiscal stimulus to avoid a sharp near term growth slowdown that could derail the overarching reform agenda but gopinath the imf chief economist said the chinese economy was already showing some signs of recovered growth which she described as green shoots
ctech in preparation for the day after the israeli general election calcalist approached prominent israeli business and tech veterans and asked them to weigh in on the challenges and opportunities the next government will have to contend with recurring themes were the importance of education more money for healthcare social inequality and the creation of a long term fiscal policy below are their answers yehudit bronicki the founder and former ceo of geothermal energy company ormat technologies and israel prize winner the emphasis needs to be on education and investment in human capital bronicki said israeli students score well below the oecd average and when technology is advancing in such a rapid pace those falling behind will be ill equipped for the future job market but the emphasis should not be placed only on technological education she said but rather on increasing productivity professional education in israel has seen dramatic cuts in recent years which will have a big impact on the israeli economy under budgeting of the arab minority in israel also has consequences for the economy when it comes to education it is important to invest in developing research skills curiosity the ability to work independently and in a team to solve problems if we don t strengthen both technological and professional education and give people who don t continue to higher education better job skills our advantages as a startup nation will be short lived tel aviv stock exchange ceo ittai ben zeev israel has real gdp growth of over three percent and low unemployment but the country is facing challenges that require the government to headline a growth encouraging policy as a multi year strategy ben zeev said that policy should include incentives and regulations that support the growth of big local tech companies and the funding and development of national infrastructure it is important to develop tools that will enable all citizens to benefit from the success of the local economy he said israeli tech veteran yehuda zisapel founder and president of israeli association of companies rad bynet group the largest challenge facing the next minister of finance is financial stability zisapel said naming factors such as inflation the us dollar and the interest rate over the last few years the growing budget deficiencies have posed an increased risk to the economy in a way that could come to a head after the election he said and no party currently has a real strategy on how to develop the economy the tech industry can take care of itself but no one is taking care of the tech industry zisapel said adding that israel must prepare itself for the new digital job market by helping employees gain relevant skills and pivot toward the industry those are also social needs he said eli zohar chairman of israeli law firm goldfarb seligman co the main task facing the next minister of finance is to lessen social inequality which in turn is expanding civil and political disagreement zohar said more of the budget should be allocated to healthcare education and culture and the minister should also strive to increase taxes according to income another issue facing the new finance minister is maintaining the integrity of the israeli rule of law and judicial system against all attempts to undermine it zohar said israeli biochemist ruth arnon co developer of multiple sclerosis drug copaxone and an israel prize winner the most crucial issue facing the next minister of finance is the betterment of israeli healthcare because in that aspect we are getting closer to being a third world country arnon said the ministry of health cannot achieve that without money the quality of doctors in israel is high but their number is low resulting in long waits and lower quality of care and the situation is graver as you venture away from the country s main urban centers there needs to be an investment in infrastructure she said more hospitals built more beds more healthcare jobs entrepreneur benny landa founder of indigo digital press and landa corporation the most important issue facing the next government is the israeli palestinian conflict landa said without discussing other reasons such as the fact that our future depends on it there is at least the financial reason until the situation is more stable i think we won t see a wave of large foreign investments in israel i have a lot of hope riding on the american plan anat levin chairman of israel based real estate development company alrov group the most important issue facing the next government is spearheading a policy change of the current israeli pension model to a model offering better protection to low income populations levin said government subsidies currently tied in dedicated bonds should be relocated to low income classes at the expense of high income classes which are the ones benefiting most from the current model to encourage people to save levin said the government need to change the current situation in which pension savings are tied to a monthly pay slip to one that can better accommodate the current market situation of often non continuous employment fixing the current model is a must if we don t want to see people becoming poor once they retire she said yossi bachar chairman of the board of israel discount bank and former director general of the israeli finance ministry the main mission of the new minister of finance is regaining public trust and building a long term fiscal policy bachar said a finance minister needs to understand you cannot get results in a day and he shouldn t act according to how he is perceived in a single moment if you are going to have four years you need to build a four year plan in practical terms this means strengthening israel s peripheral communities via better education and financial incentives he said to work against the trend of people relocating to the country s center in search of better jobs you cannot continue to flood the greater tel aviv area unless people start using helicopters instead of cars serial entrepreneur and tech investor yossi vardi vardi is also of the opinion that education and economic development are the main issues that need to be tackled in order to boost productivity and lessen social inequality israeli tech is successful he said but it accounts for eight percent of the workforce and that wealth is not spreading enough to the rest of society the problem is known the weaker sectors are arabs bedouins ultra orthodox israelis of ethiopian descent the social and economic periphery education economic development and training should be the mission of the entire government and just not for economic reasons but to strengthen society finance ministers that do their work right shouldn t be concerned with saving money but with correct resource allocation israeli pediatrician and geneticist rivka carmi formerly the president of ben gurion university of the negev israel s entire healthcare policy needs an overhaul carmi said the population is living longer and growing older and human resource planning in the sector is not reflecting that there are not enough beds and manpower young doctors prefer to work in industries like biomed because the burnout rate in medicine is unbelievable eli fischer founder and president of pharmaceutical and cosmetics company dr fischer cutting bureaucratic red tape to encourage local industry is a significant challenge of the next government according to fischer the tech industry is focused on maximizing short term profit by selling early he said but manufacturing facilities that operate for decades are the basis for a long term stable economy and in recent years almost no new factories were established in israel local companies that do need manufacturing facilities choose to set up in the us or europe because the bureaucratic procedures there are much easier and quicker you can always import but who will provide local employment and provide food medicine and agriculture products especially in times of war regulation should only pertain to things that cannot operate without it there s no economy without a local manufacturing industry

the remark drifted quietly past nearly all political watchers but inside congress it reverberated like a patch of rolling thunder i m not worried what wendell thinks said mark pocan d wisc the co chair of the congressional progressive caucus in february when he gets elected to congress it ll matter wendell was a reference to wendell primus a top policy aide to house speaker nancy pelosi who inside the halls of congress needs no surname clarification pocan gave voice to simmering frustrations about primus s meddling in internal house policy debates on the hill there s a name given to people like primus unelected lifers who use their years of service and clout to influence the party s direction he s a member staffer and members don t like it when a staffer even a member staffer starts setting the boundaries of their ambitions primus serves as pelosi s sharp elbows particularly on health policy he is working directly with the trump white house on watered down drug pricing legislation that differs from a bill favored by house liberals and as the intercept has reported primus reassured insurance executives last december shortly after the democratic takeover of the house that party leadership would not favor a medicare for all plan he also lashed out at medicare for all on tape at a little noticed health care conference in irvine california in february homing in on regional differences in provider reimbursement rates as a signature obstacle the regional issues about transfers of money that were involved are enormous here and for that reason i don t think it s going to happen he said adding that senior democrats all agreed with him on this primus even cited a right wing study about the costs of single payer neglecting to mention that the same study found that it would reduce overall health expenditures pelosi has defended primus publicly touting him in the washington post as probably the most progressive staff person on capitol hill pelosi s office wouldn t make primus available for interview but in an email spokesperson henry connelly said that wendell is the architect of some of the most sweeping and impactful progress in extending health coverage and lowering americans health costs that has been signed into law in the past 50 years but one line from the slide deck primus presented to insurers reveals the disconnect between what progressive means to the old guard in congress and what it means to a new generation among other criticisms primus explained to insurers that stakeholders are against single payer therefore leadership is too this rationale for policy opposition stakeholders are against virtually anything that would damage their interests regardless of whether it benefits the public represents primus s worldview in one phrase you could call him the last of the loser liberals desperate to maintain the last few scraps of the welfare state rather than forward anything more bold the mindset views younger progressives as people to protect leadership from and anti government conservatives as people to bargain with they strive not to make the world a better place but to make it less bad than republicans want rep mark desaulnier of california has clashed with primus and said that he is a symptom of a broader cultural problem in washington there are mostly good people in staff but there are some people who start to think they have to protect democracy from elected officials desaulnier said if you even bring up something that s hard to do or aspirational staff are like oh you can t do that here which is a self fulfilling prophecy protesters holds signs rallying against then president bill clinton s approval of the welfare reform bill in downtown los angeles calif on aug 4 1996 photo frank wiese ap primus was once seen as the face of the principled left fighting the ravages of clintonism from the inside in 1996 he resigned as deputy assistant secretary of the department of health and human services in a public protest against president bill clinton s decision to sign the welfare reform bill at hhs primus produced a study showing that welfare reform would increase child poverty a prediction that hasn t really come true because of other policy supports for children although overall poverty is indeed up to remain would be to disown all the analysis my office has produced regarding the impact of the bill he wrote in his resignation letter the resignation was an important act of defiance from the left flank of the party and should be commended but by 2001 when studies showed two parent families increasing particularly among low income african americans primus told the new york times in many ways welfare reform is working better than i thought it would the sky isn t falling anymore whatever we have been doing over the last five years we ought to keep going of course those numbers were mainly due to a stock fueled economic boom in the late 1990s and when that reversed during the great recession a lack of welfare benefits utterly failed the poor connelly responded to this quote by saying you shouldn t cherry pick a single comment from a man who had the courage to actually resign over welfare reform but he didn t answer the question of whether primus still thinks that welfare reform worked better than expected the fight over welfare reform is illustrative in another way primus like many liberals of his generation was mostly engaging in the same work he does today defending america s meager safety net from a right wing assault prior to working in the clinton administration he spent several years on the house ways and means committee as chief economist and staff director for the human resources subcommittee he penned his own welfare legislation which was a bit kinder to the poor in the 1980s he helped draft the gramm rudman hollings balanced budget act softening the most harmful implications of its automatic spending cuts the impetus was the same protect the safety net there s an entire cottage industry on the center left dedicated to this purpose with which primus has long been associated after leaving the clinton administration he joined the center on budget and policy priorities which focuses on welfare state programs its tentative approach is embedded in its very name while today s progressives are arguing for medicare for all and a full blown economic restructuring around a green new deal yesterday s were weighing different budget and policy priorities defending some while sacrificing others in an endless retreat primus has also written for the brookings institution another similarly aligned organization that was once the beating heart of liberal policymaking but is absent from today s more ambitious debates progressive economist dean baker recalled a meeting he took with primus in 2000 at the time there was a huge budget surplus and baker had just released a book calling for no cuts to social security primus asked him to soften his resistance if the cuts would pay for other important programs baker recalled that primus said i m worried about the budget in 2015 how are we going to pay for food stamps in 2015 and he was dead serious maybe i m an optimist but aren t there other things to worry about primus and those who think like him have a well established mindset and a narrow viewpoint on policy debates one beaten into them by the reagan years they want to preserve benefits for the poor and needy without too many painful cutbacks they are deficit hawks who want to use resources they consider scarce to barely cover what we have today they generally seek to protect the handful of programs that managed to survive the conservative revolution because they believe that s all government can do without question these organizations play an important defensive role on the left and can provide a countervailing force to the clintonite center and the far right they re not inherently bad people they re simply creatures of their time as we all are for instance primus joined pelosi s office and was a key conduit between the cbpp brookings axis and capitol hill during the debate over the affordable care act primus clashed so much with white house chief of staff rahm emanuel that the two couldn t be in the same room together according to the washington post emanuel wanted to scale back the aca but primus won that battle they do great work between the 40 yard lines said baker whenever something might be cut in congress they do the best stuff on why it s bad it s good and useful stuff but it s never going to change the ballgame others who have clashed with primus think his worldview is ultimately self defeating if you followed their advice all the programs they re interested in saving would be cut they would all be worse off today than right now said alex lawson of social security works we are now in a different era than even a few short years ago progressives responding to decades of stagnant wages sinking economic mobility and soaring income and wealth inequality have proposed structural changes across the board this goes well beyond the pity charity liberalism that grants some minor alms for society s losers rather than broad agency or power for the working class it s a problem throughout the caucus said one house aide who sought anonymity to speak candidly these people who are thought of as liberal lions have not updated themselves to the politics of the moment instead of fighting the rahm emanuels of the world that puts primus in opposition to the vanguard of the left and that has created significant tension it doesn t help that primus s portfolio primarily includes health policy the area that won house democrats the 2018 midterms and where the left has constructed a defined imperative to take on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries primus has been the proxy for pelosi s fight to control the narrative on health care pelosi has made clear that she follows primus s lead on these issues on health policy what does wendell think is what we say all the time about this issue the speaker said at a 2013 town hall he s very much empowered by the speaker said the house staffer the speaker is running a thing where he gets the first draft on these policies the controversy between primus and liberal lawmakers in this congress started with his undermining medicare for all pelosi has promised hearings on a medicare for all bill during this congressional session which is farther than any similar effort has gone but she s been ambivalent in public about the concept behind the scenes primus has attempted to knife it pelosi said washington rep pramila jayapal has made it clear that isn t necessarily the fix that she at this moment believes in but she is respectful of me in leading this effort and i would expect her staff to at least follow that in the slide presentation to insurers primus said that party leaders weren t interested in medicare for all and wanted to work with the trump administration on drug price legislation instead improving the affordable care act would be the most cost effective path to universal coverage according to primus s slides house democrats recently proposed a package of legislation to do just that by expanding exchange subsidies and instituting a national reinsurance program primus described single payer with phrases like implementation challenges monies needed for other priorities and creates winners and losers along with the warning that stakeholders are against it last week politico reported on a second primus meeting this time with health policy researchers where he called medicare for all an unhelpful distraction and solicited research to discredit the idea or at least amplify its risks pelosi s office denied that primus was requesting hit pieces wendell absolutely did not ask for any kind of one sided analysis of medicare for all and anyone who says otherwise wasn t actually listening said connelly but at the health care conference in irvine primus approvingly cited the charles blahous study for the mercatus center at george mason university a hit piece that produced an allegedly staggering cost for medicare for all there are experts on the right and the left chuck blahous the urban institute that have said all of that about 32 trillion primus said blahous s own calculations reveal that medicare for all would save americans 2 trillion relative to what they would spend on health care under the current system while covering 30 million more people despite that right wing media and campaign ads have consistently parroted the headline 32 trillion figure without context it s jarring to see the alleged most progressive staff person on capitol hill do the same primus seemed to recognize the minefield he was walking into in irvine saying about medicare for all i get myself into trouble every time i say something about this the progressive caucus demanded answers from primus on his medicare for all maneuvering last week even going through the slide presentation piece by piece primus insisted that his remarks were distorted but members didn t seem to take that as a sufficient answer it s really inappropriate for staff representing the speaker s office to be undercutting members of our caucus said jayapal after the meeting this does not help us at all and was frankly insulting to those elected to represent our constituents added desaulnier i didn t hear an apology from him on drug prices primus has been far more aggressive taking the lead in dictating policy he is known in the capitol as a principled foe of drug industry greed in his briefing for insurers primus mentioned a handful of modest but worthwhile ideas like lifting roadblocks to generic medication production stopping schemes that lengthen patent protections and ending pay for delay in which a drug company pays a generic manufacturer to not produce a generic version of an expensive drug two of these passed the house energy and commerce committee last wednesday but since congress s swearing in primus has become obsessed with finding a drug proposal the trump administration will support in february he backed an idea to use third party arbitration to set the price of certain prescription drugs this neglected the fact that for a year house democrats were coalescing around a bill from rep lloyd doggett d texas to require medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over price and if they refused to authorize compulsory licensing of that drug to generic manufacturers doggett has 122 co sponsors for his bill yet primus short circuited it pharma peeled off members from his bill said lawson wendell s discussion gave those who dropped the ability to say it s not because of my funders but because of the same concerns that wendell has primus initially signaled support for doggett but shifted to arbitration around the same time patients for affordable drugs a group funded by former hedge fund manager john arnold started to favor the concept arnold has spent enormous money on ads both for and against members lawson said maybe he s thinking this is the way to keep them on his side the arbitration concept grew out of a 2008 study in health affairs from a former obama administration official and a director at health insurer aetna the government and the drugmaker would submit prices and a third party arbitrator would select one or choose a third price based on their own research primus s version would only cover a select set of high cost drugs and critics fear that the arbiter would be unaccountable and the process opaque initial reports suggested that the arbitration would be voluntary and nonbinding though connelly suggested that those reports were false we re continuing to incorporate feedback and ideas from members and stakeholders about how we can develop the toughest possible bill he said still it s unclear whether drug manufacturers would be forced to accept the arbitrated price we do know that pharmaceutical lobbyists appear to be more comfortable with the arbitration concept which comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of the debate said peter maybarduk director of public citizen s access to medicines program it s not a good strategy to be reasonable to the pharmaceutical lobby you have to be bold and go after them with a fight that s big enough that the public is engaged and mobilized in support primus has progressed to formal talks with the trump administration as well as senate finance committee chair chuck grassley r iowa as part of what s been called a reassurance tour with groups inside and outside of the capitol primus told progressive caucus members that he was not negotiating with the white house but instead trying to find something all house democrats could support doggett has said that any potential compromise must be on something that really makes a difference in the lives of people on health care and not agreement for agreement s sake it s hard to square primus s insistence that he s not negotiating with the white house with what he said at the irvine health care conference i think we will cut a deal with the administration and i think that if we do it right in the house that will give it enough push to get it done in the senate he added i think it s going to take some time to educate members about all of this primus has also tried to derail an idea from the trump administration some consider useful he wants to delay an hhs rule to eliminate the legal kickbacks that pharmacy benefit managers get from negotiating rebates with drug companies supporters believe ending rebates will change the business model for pharmacy benefit managers and control the misaligned incentives that lead to high list prices the higher the list price the higher the rebate the story goes and if rebates are effectively banned pbms would have to earn their fees from insurers by pushing list prices down at the irvine health care conference primus cited estimates from the center on medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary suggesting higher consumer prices and government costs from the rebate rule if you take away those rebates prescription drug prices might go down a little bit but they re not going to come down nearly enough to offset the loss of the rebates primus said the administration has no authority right now to force the manufacturers to lower list prices the speaker has said something similar nobody thinks banning rebates will cure all ills in the pharmaceutical supply chain but primus s complaint that the government might have to pay more fits with his longstanding concern over federal deficits then president ronald reagan center signs the social security act amendment with vice president george bush sen bob dole rep tip o neill and daniel moynihan on hand as witnesses in 1983 photo corbis via getty images another slide in primus s insurance presentation titled not preparing for boomer retirement explained how deficits could strain health budgets as the population ages this has been a consistent primus concern we didn t use the decade just before the baby boom generation retired to get ready primus said in a 2010 roundtable on social security preserved on c span that is really one of the greatest failures of the bush administration i could think of others in that roundtable primus advised lawmakers to learn the lesson of 1983 when ronald reagan and tip o neill got together to make social security more solvent by among other things gradually raising the retirement age for full benefits president barack obama did try to reduce the cost of living adjustment in social security a net benefit cut primus according to several outside groups warned them against going hard against the obama plan and asked them to slow walk any calls for expanding the program it was a replay of the conversation dean baker had with primus a decade earlier but the groups didn t listen rallied against obama s benefit cut and for social security expansion and won two hundred house democrats endorsed a social security expansion bill this year this rare loss for primus didn t alter his viewpoints on fearing deficits and debt lawson said that primus was the driving force behind pelosi including a controversial pay go provision into house rules requiring all new spending to be offset with either budget cuts or tax increases and his top priority for the prescription drug plan according to his remarks at the irvine health care conference is that it saves money for the government which can then be plowed into other programs when pete peterson a billionaire who spent hundreds of millions of dollars to push washington policymakers toward austerity died in 2018 pelosi delivered a floor speech that praised him effusively as if he d dedicated his life to eradicating child malnutrition or curing cancer rather than pouring millions into pushing for major cuts to social security and medicare pete was a clarion voice for fiscal responsibility and a strong moral conscience in washington pelosi said in her house floor eulogy of peterson who by 2012 had already spent half a billion dollars targeting social security medicare and other spending programs if primus didn t write that speech he surely supported it he was 100 percent the main guy behind pay go lawson said he thinks the thing you do as a lefty is that you reduce the deficit jayapal acknowledged primus s long tenure in washington but suggested that it wasn t necessarily something to celebrate this is somebody who has been a staff for a very long time we don t have the health care system we need do we she said maybe it s time to try something new while progressives have been more willing to attack primus as a member staffer interfering with their priorities they haven t extended that critique to the woman empowering him pelosi the speaker respects members this is separate from her desaulnier said jayapal added she has always been respectful of members but without a go sign from the speaker primus wouldn t have any weight to throw around while the house democratic caucus has unified in opposition to trump there are key splits on core values and ideals it s a bit easier to blame the split on a staffer but the root cause has yet to be resolved

tensions in trade policy could flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains she cautioned washington describing current global economic atmosphere as a delicate moment international monetary fund imf â chief economist gita gopinath onâ 9 april said that while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks beyond 2020 global growth is expected to stabilise at around 3â½ per cent bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income she said in a blog post ahead of the annual spring meeting of the imf and the world bank advertisement growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilise at five percent though with considerable variance as emerging asia continues to grow faster than other regions a similar pattern holds for low income countries with some particularly commodity importers growing rapidly but others falling further behind the advanced world in per capita terms the indian american economist said while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks gopinath said tensions in trade policy could flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains she cautioned advertisement growth in systemic economies such as the euro area and china may surprise on the downside and the risks surrounding brexit remain heightened a deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries including sovereign bank doom loop risks gopinath warned advertisement given these risks she argued it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment she said fiscal policy will need to manage trade offs between supporting demand protecting social spending and ensuring that public debt remains on a sustainable path with the optimal mix depending on country specific circumstances advertisement financial sector policies must address vulnerabilities proactively by deploying macroprudential tools such as counter cyclical capital buffers â a task made more urgent by the possibility that interest rates will remain low for longer monetary policy should remain data dependent be well communicated and ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored she said across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience the top imf economist said advertisement there is a need for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts to address climate change and risks from cyber security and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation she said this is a delicate moment for the global economy if the downside risks do not materialize and the policy support put in place is effective global growth should rebound gopinath said advertisement if however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed in that case policymakers will need to adjust she added
imf cautions nigeria against borrowing from china the international monetary fund imf has warned nigeria and other emerging market countries taking excessive loans from china to consider the terms of such facilities especially their compliance with the paris club arrangements speaking on wednesday at the ongoing imf world bank spring meetings in united states of america director imf monetary and capital markets department tobias andrian said that there was nothing bad in borrowing from china except that the terms of such loans are always questionable he said loans from china are good but the countries should consider the terms of the loans and we urge countries that when they borrow from abroad the terms are favorable for the borrower and should be conforming to the paris club arrangements continuing andrian who spoke on the global financial stability report gfsr said let me reiterate that in many frontier markets we see that the share of debt that is not conforming to the paris club standards is on the rise and that means that if there is any debt restructuring down the road one day that can be very unfavorable to those countries so the borrowing terms the covenants are extremely important and we do see a deterioration in that aspect data from debt management office dmo showed that nigeria s total public debt rose to n24 39 trillion or 79 44 billion as at december 31 2018 representing a year on year growth of 12 25 per cent the 2018 debt stock is higher than the one recorded in 2017 by n2 662 billion dmo said that as at june 2018 loans obtained by the federal government from china represented about 8 5 per cent of nigeria s external debt and that there taken under concessionary terms but nigeria was last year seeking 6 billion from china to fund the construction of the ibadan kano rail line project andrian said nigeria has been borrowing from international markets which gives the imf some worries saying however that such loans are good as it allows the country to invest more but expressed concerns over rollover or repayment risks going forward at the moment funding conditions in economies such as nigeria and other sub saharan african countries are very favourable but that might change at some point and there is risk of rollovers and whether these need for refinancing can be met in the future the imf director said advising that nigeria should seek higher capital for its banks through recapitalization and also tackle rising non performing loans in the sector adrian said that where there are financial stability concerns authorities are expected to use prudential tools such as higher capital in the banking system and more conservative underwriting standards to reduce financial stability risks he said we advise countries that where those downside risks are increasing to take more steps to ensure that vulnerabilities are not rising too much addressing non performing loans is a first order importance for financial stability many countries have tackled that by developing secondary market for non performing loans and by being aggressive in writing off non performing loans and through provisioning and use of improved accounting standards through international financial reporting standards 9 ifrs 9 he said many countries do not have all the tools that are necessary to make sure that the system is financially stable hence the financial stability concerns can feed into monetary policy decisions he therefore urged monetary policy makers to also look at risks to financial stability both in the short term and in the medium term as a way out of the crisis the imf director advised policymakers to develop and deploy macro prudential tools which can mitigate vulnerabilities and make the financial system more resilient emerging markets facing volatile capital flows should limit their reliance on short term overseas debt and ensure they have adequate foreign currency reserves and bank buffers besides monetary policy should be data dependent and well communicated he said also speaking the division chief monetary and capital markets at the imf anna ilyina said the institutional mechanisms for resolution and recognition of non performing loans are of course extremely important part of the process of cleaning up the banking system of bad loans and the authorities should continue working along those lines she said credit quality has declined underwriting standards weaker and debt levels are much higher the concern is that there are very few macro prudential tools for the corporate sector in some countries supervisors can limit the deterioration of underwriting standards to the extent that is provided by the banks but one of the big trends post crisis is that market based finance has become more important for the corporates she advised that in maturing credit cycle farsighted policy actions to reduce vulnerabilities can help avoid more painful adjustments in the future on capital flow to nigeria and other emerging markets the imf director said that overseas investment run by managers tracking popular indices have increased dramatically over the past decade she said widening the range of investors can be positive factor for emerging markets yet that trend leaves economies vulnerable to a sudden reversal of capital flows in response to global trends the vulnerabilities intensifying in a maturing credit cycle this is the time for decisive policy action the intensification of trade tensions and the threat of disorderly practices have dented investor confidence policy makers should ensure that post crisis regulatory reform is fully implemented and resist calls for rolling back reforms she said she also said that policymakers should act decisively to renew their commitment to open trade discourage the buildup of debt and communicate clearly any shifts in monetary policy speaking on tax reforms at the fiscal monitor session of the event imf assistant director fiscal affairs department cathy pattillo said tax reform in nigeria is very important issue she said imf s main recommendation for nigeria is the need for a comprehensive tax reform that would sustainably increase non oil revenue and the reason why that is needed is that nigeria has one of the lowest ratios of non oil revenue to gross domestic product gdp at around 3 4 per cent in the world and the total tax revenue to gdp at around eight per cent is also very low compared to peers she said that the interest to tax ratio is low adding that the funds realized should be spent on important developmental projects like infrastructure and human capital she also advised nigeria increase excise taxes and begin aggressive streamlining of tax incentives and exemptions
the net international investment position herein niip is one that gets very little news or analysts attention this is probably true because it hasn t really ever affected the economy in a negative way noticeably at least i only became aware of it myself probably about 6 or 7 years ago i ve been paying attention to it ever since the niip is basically the difference between how much assets a country owns of the rest of the world minus the amount of assets the rest of the world owns of their country it was post the last recession when it really started to take a turn for the worse here is a chart of the niip going back to 1976 when we had a surplus in 2018 our niip dropped to negative 9 717 trillion the bureau of economics analysis has this chart that shows the levels of us owned foreign assets and us assets that are foreign owned it s better to look at from a of gdp for perspective as of 2018 it is down to 47 4 of our gdp how we got here i googled mercantilism and got this historical definition the economic theory that trade generates wealth and is stimulated by the accumulation of profitable balances which a government should encourage by means of protectionism you ll come to learn that we have failed to learn this particular definition in america it is the balances of trade that will lead to distortions in a country s niip what we must focus on however is what is known as the current account balance the current account is not just the trade balance of goods and services being exchanged it also includes monetary transactions like dividends being earned overseas and sent back to the us investor or dividends earned by foreigners and being sent out of the home country the current account also includes what are called remittances let s say an american goes to work in japan for a year and earns a salary of 100 000 usd he or she may well send a good portion of that back home to their family in the us same goes for people who come to the us legally or not work and send their money back to their home country add up all these balances and you get a net current account balance note the terminology and semantics with respect to these various measures of trade balances can get tricky the chart i have below of the balance on current account nipa s is defined per the bureau of economic analysis as follows net measure of transactions between the united states and the rest of the world in goods services income and current transfers the chart goes back to 1976 when i tally up all surpluses and deficits from 1976 on the current account balances per year i get this 11 500 trillion that more or less is the main source of our niip predicament it has been with those dollars that instead of buying goods and or services from us workers they instead bought our bonds our houses our hotels our utility companies and shares of our public companies as well hence americans collectively own about 25 trillion in foreign assets while foreigners own collectively about 35 trillion in us assets strong dollar i keep thinking about this concept that i read in peter bernstein s book the power of gold a history of an obsession wherein he continually refers to this story told by a man 100 years ago named john ruskin the story goes that a man boarded a ship carrying all his wealth in a bag of gold coins as the ship was at sea there was a storm and the captain ordered everyone to abandon ship the man then strapped his bag of gold coins to his waist and jumped overboard and sank directly to the bottom of the sea ruskin would ask now as he was sinking had he the gold or had the gold him the strength of the us currency relative to that of our trading partners has played a key role in how we got into this predicament of having such a large negative niip when i worked in manufacturing from 1999 2004 just as china entered the world trade organization the pressure was on to figure out how to compete with their substantially cheaper labor force my company invested in opening a plant in the philippines we would bring over 100s of our future filipino workers to the us to train at the time i was working as a technical service engineer and was making about 180 a day the folks we trained to do my job earned 8 a day we still failed and china basically became the manufacturer of the products we made as most of the domestic supplies folded i later learned that many of the filipino engineers we trained went on to china to work there in the same field the problem with having a strong dollar makes foreign labor costs that much more attractive to let them do it let them do it the current account balance started to tank in 2000 and has since remained very large with no signs of improving a lot of what happened was we outsourced a tremendous amount of our goods producing jobs overseas when i say outsourced i mean that us buyers would instead find suppliers overseas vs domestically the domestic companies would then fold in most cases you can see in this chart below the collapse post 2000 in goods producing jobs even with clothing in 2000 america still produced 29 of the clothes we bought domestically by 2013 it was down to just 2 these jobs were not lost to robots or automation they were lost to the rest of the world in 2008 hershey chocolate moved their production from hershey pennsylvania to mexico we let someone else do it and simply give them our dollars in return remittances remittances is another financial statistic that plays a big role in our negative current account balance remittances are money that is sent back to one s home country and out of the country where it was earned in 2017 foreigners sent 148 489 billion out of the us and back to their home country meanwhile 6 621 billion would be sent into the us from outside the country this net difference of 141 86 billion is part of the overall deficit of 472 5 billion in 2017 that comes to 30 of the total deficit in 2017 conclusion we are at a point now where the difference in assets has become so large that the capital account which is interest on debts and dividends on stocks for example will continue to feed itself and grow even larger into the coffers of the rest of the world interest on the federal debt that is foreign owned is tax money that simply leaves the country remittances are only going to continue to favor the rest of the world trade of goods and services will also be very hard to balance but is playing less of an important role as the capital account and remittances become bigger factors in the overall current account balance the paradox is our strong dollar are we sinking to bankruptcy to the rest of the world have we the strong dollar or had the strong dollar us there is a lot of money that simply leaves the us every year that is money that is not getting invested domestically at a minimum put this financial data point in the back of your head as it s going to begin to play a bigger and bigger role with respect to both our fiscal policy and fed policy too it ll probably make the response to the next recession or financial crisis less easy to deal with qe will be more impotent as more and more money leaves the country to our foreign owners
about that hard landing some china haters have been forecasting now since around 2009 if president trump s trade war can t stop china what will the international monetary fund raised its china gdp target to 6 3 for 2019 from their january estimate of 6 2 it s not a huge bump but it s going in the right direction china s debt load is often cited as the reason to be bearish most estimates have nonperforming loans quite low and on par with averages seen within the member states of the organization for economic cooperation development there are other problems besides credit that befuddle china investors and to some degree chinese policymakers things like oversupply and dependence on real estate and land sales for economic growth at the provincial level but overall china s transformation continues this frankenstein economy that is one half communist one half capitalist is a short seller s nightmare not even trump s trade officials running roughshod over them has been enough to force a hard landing of the chinese economy which by the way might be a terrible idea for countries throughout asia and even in faraway places like brazil that have come to count on china as a key part of its export market last week china s official manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi surged 1 3 points to 50 5 for march beating market estimates of just under 50 the caixin pmi which is often more trusted by the market because it covers more small and medium sized enterprises rose to 50 8 from 49 9 finally china s services pmi is also over 50 and not looking back in the last year or so china s economy has faced twin headwinds from u s trade aggression and domestic reforms but the government s stabilization measures now appear to be bearing fruit reducing the odds of a hard landing says jan dehn head of research for the ashmore group an emerging market bond fund manager with a little over 70 billion invested in emerging markets china s current account surplus rose by 0 8 of gdp in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 1 5 of gdp or 54 6 billion driven by guess what a trade surplus which was 38 higher on the quarter thanks to a record breaking u s trade deficit china s exports are expected to have rebounded in march after a sharp drop in february while imports likely shrank for a fourth straight month a reuters poll from wednesday showed meanwhile trump s trade war is in limbo dialogue between the two sides continues even as officials and sources tell media that negotiations are in the final stages trump said on saturday that a deal could materialize in as little as four weeks though the deal looks already like a paper tiger to china hawks who see trump giving xi jinping too much time to adhere to promises while trump s time in the white house is limited 2016 bloomberg finance lp last friday larry kudlow announced that beijing had finally conceded that u s officials have a point on intellectual property theft noting previously that they were in denial but whether china is ready to commit to reform such as hardening its stance against ip theft ending mandatory transfers of technology and removing non tariff barriers to u s goods is tough to tell plus china has probably moved as far as it will go on ip protection having just opened up its court for intellectual property rights in december china s sense of sovereignty and its ambition to be a modern powerful economy might mean it gives up the appearance of mercantilism but keeps the same operating mode of centralized industrial planning and that means state subsidies china can work around the u s on this as provincial leaders can do what they want regarding lending and lending support to favorite industries beijing can throw them under the bus only when necessary we think beijing will lump in higher tariffs with the cost of doing business in the u s at least in the near term we do not expect any quick deals to resolve these ongoing tensions says vladimir signorelli founder of brettonwoods research a macro investment research firm in new jersey some early indications from beijing suggest a quid pro quo approach is likely earlier this month china announced that beginning may 1 china would ban the export of all fentanyl related products to the u s a leading cause of heroin addiction these and other token steps suggest that it may be an accord in name only and not much more additional time is likely necessary for a fuller agreement and xi has all the time in the world we ve seen china grow to incredibly high levels of double diigits and everyone knew it would come down to earth someday but we never thought china would crash says andrew miller cio of mondrian investment partners our view was that gdp stabilizes around 6 and very gradually eases down over the next five to ten years he says about the hard landing that wasn t miller is not too worried about a hard landing the trade war will cause volatility giving investors a good chance to buy china cheaply trade war or not we believe the china consumer will get wealthier over the long term urbanization will increase and we are just going to invest in companies that will benefit from that miller says

executive officer sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today since our last call i ve continued immersing myself in the business and have been able to start making some changes in areas of importance and where there has been good opportunity for improvement as you might recall in q1 of this fiscal year i visited our clubs in operations in most major markets throughout central america panama and colombia and since our last call along with my senior management team we ve traveled to our caribbean markets and had pretty comprehensive visits of most of our clubs and related operations in the dr trinidad jamaica and the usvi we thoroughly explored all aspects of our clubs our operations and distribution centers and the competition in those markets i had the pleasure of spending time with many dynamic and entrepreneurial members of our local management team and associates we also engaged directly with members on the sales force to get a better understanding of how we could bring better value to their lives and their businesses i am excited to say that we ve got a quite robust business in the caribbean and many of our locations do warrant further investment to increase capacity capacity that would make it easier for our members to shop and as a result drive same store sales we also found many opportunities to increase efficiencies similar to the impression that i had after visiting colombia and our central american markets in many cases our business will benefit from getting back to basics as you ve heard before i refer you to the six rights of merchandising that were originally introduced by sol and robert price our founders and as a reminder the six rights are having the right merchandise in the right place at the right time in the right quantity in the right condition and at the right price just as important as getting back to basics is that we recognize we need to meanwhile increase our capabilities with technology that s available today so that we can better know our members and we can deliver greater value to them today and in the future recognizing these principles our goals and priorities are to number one drive same store sales growth by increasing our vigilance about the six rights second is to drive long term growth both through our new format concept which by the way is scheduled to launch this summer and the opening of additional clubs third we need to leverage the technology and the talent we ve acquired through what has been referred to as aeropost the company we bought last year and that is in order to create closer connectivity with our members and we need to accelerate our digital and omnichannel transformation to also drive growth i m in the process of continuing to assess talent identify gaps and make changes where appropriate in key areas such as merchandising and member experience and to continue to build on the strength of our team finally our goal is to continue to reenergize the culture of performance and accountability we are making progress i ll share with you some specific examples with regard to real estate as i mentioned our new club format is scheduled to open this summer in the dominican republic we refer to this club as bolivar this club s physical sales floor will be smaller than our traditional format but it s effectively augmented by the fact that our members can purchase for delivery at good value a significant number of items including white goods and major appliances that will be displayed but not stocked in the clubs we are finding ways to do this so that we can meanwhile enhance the value proposition for the members both in terms of price and in terms of the convenience we believe that this new format concept which incorporates omnichannel and an e commerce platform will open up additional real estate and growth opportunities for us in the future i d like to invite you all to join us in a few weeks for the opening of another club in santiago panama which we refer to as veraguas in addition two more clubs are in the process of being built one in panama city and the other in san cristobal guatemala in total these four clubs represent about 10 club growth by the end of this calendar year bringing us to a total of 45 clubs now i d like to talk a little bit about another area of priority and that is the integration of the company that we ve been referring to as aeropost into pricesmart it s going well we ve launched online membership capability we ve begun cross marketing between aeropost customers and pricesmart members the team is working closely to launch an e commerce website as part of the new format launch in the dominican republic and we expect that to expand as sales are beginning to be generated from online although it s small at this time another significant development is that we ve moved a key executive with aeropost into a newly created role responsible for member experience this is a role that is embedded in the core of our company and will now report directly to me this position is entirely committed to strengthening our bond with our member by helping us better understand and anticipate our members expectations this new svp of member experience brings with him expertise in digital marketing which will be applied to smartly use our data one of our most valuable resources and that will enable us to deliver greater value which should then drive sales our commitment to digital transformation is also reflected in the fact that we ve established digital transformation committee of the board of directors to support at the highest levels of the company our efforts to increase opportunities that technology will bring so that we can effectively execute on the six rights with respect to merchandise and buying a core area of our business we made numerous recent talent moves throughout the company and we are strengthening the buying leadership in our san diego office for both us foods and non foods we re also creating a senior executive position focused on building and serving the specific needs of our business membership to develop that area further these additions and moves will lead to improvements in our merchandise and our ability to deliver on the six rights we also continue to innovate and increase options for last mile delivery this is not necessarily focused specifically on e commerce but so much as being responsive it s more about being responsive to what our members what we re understanding from our members as an expectation in terms of their shopping experience and by way of example we are contracting with third parties in markets in colombia to be able to provide cost effective delivery we are engaging in other initiatives in our other markets to facilitate direct vendor deliveries and in many of those cases it s resulting in better pricing for our members so there is a focus on again addressing what we are hearing from our members as an additional expectation in terms of facilitating the ability to have merchandise delivered to them directly so now let me turn to our results with an overview of q2 total revenues were 854 4 million an increase of 1 8 over the comparable prior year period which includes a 9 9 million contribution from the business that we acquired in march of last year net merchandising sales were 820 3 million an increase of 0 5 over the prior year period currency fluctuations had a negative 3 6 impact on net merchandise sales comparable net merchandise sales decreased by 0 9 with currency fluctuations impacting comparable sales negatively by 3 7 just as a side note here the fx fluctuations and the number of markets in which we ve been experiencing external forces whether economic or geopolitical is probably more prominent than i can recall in recent quarters and it definitely is having an impact on our overall performance as a reminder we ended this quarter with 41 warehouse clubs compared to 40 clubs at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 was 23 8 million or 0 79 per share compared to 14 1 million or 0 47 per share in the comparable period last year this result includes the 0 14 per share impact from a combination of our ongoing investments in the development of our omnichannel platform the costs associated with the acquisition we made in march of 2018 and the operations of that business the quarter also includes a 0 05 per share positive impact from the payment from one of our credit card vendors as such these two factors combined had an eps impact of a negative 0 09 per share the central american region where we have 12 clubs had a 2 5 decrease on total merchandise sales and in comparable sales general weakness in these economies including costa rica panama guatemala and nicaragua contributed approximately 1 7 of the total comparable sales decrease the impact of currency on total and comparable sales to the central american segment were each negative 3 6 turning now to the caribbean the caribbean region where we have 22 clubs had a total merchandise sales growth of 6 5 with a comparable sales growth of 1 7 the usvi again reported strong sales growth of approximately 7 and that was in part resulting from the prior year s hurricanes impacts on our competitors jamaica performed well while the dominican republic was cannibalized by the san isidro store opening which had a negative impact on net comparable sales of approximately 70 basis points the impact of currency once again on total and comparable sales to the caribbean segment was negative 1 5 and negative 1 4 respectively and last in colombia where we now have seven clubs we finished with 0 9 growth year over year with comparable sales growth of 1 1 the impact of currency on total and comparable sales in colombia was significant at negative 8 9 and negative 9 9 respectively in terms of merchandise categories we saw good comps growth in our overall softlines category which increased 2 2 driven primarily by 14 1 growth in our fashion apparel department we also saw positive comps within our foods and fresh categories and several other departments with good us dollar comps including soda and beverages pet supplies seafood and meat please note that in total the foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted our sales growth by 3 6 however we still have room for improvement in several other categories that include juices and drinks and snacks cookies and foods as well as electronics with hardlines within hardlines now i d like to move to membership i think membership shows a very positive message and one that i d like us to be focused on in terms of the future potential we finished the quarter with approximately 1 6 million accounts which is a 3 2 increase fiscal year to date membership income was up by 1 1 during the quarter the 12 month renewal rate notwithstanding all of these challenges at the end of february was 85 of note the platinum program grew 37 year over year and has now been rolled out in panama costa rica the dominican republic usvi and honduras now platinum membership represents only about 2 5 of our total membership base and as you can tell from that there is significant potential for expanding this program turning quickly to march sales which were released last week net merchandise sales were 261 5 million an increase of 0 1 versus a year ago fx fluctuations negatively impact impacted net merchandise sales by 3 3 for the four weeks ended march 31 2019 comparable net merchandise sales decreased 1 or exactly 1 with a negative fx impact of 3 3 unlike last year this four week period did not include semana santa which boosted sales a year ago in closing this is a business model that succeeded for over 40 years the core principles and discipline of the business the six rights are just as relevant today as they were 40 years ago the best way to execute on that discipline however has evolved with the digital capabilities that is with today we have access to better tools better tools to execute more effectively on our core business strategy we have an incredible and committed team of almost 9 000 employees and i ve seen firsthand how much we re valued in the communities where we operate i m confident with our renewed focus on the basics the increased efficiencies the incorporation of technology and the related talent to support that in our core business we will be able to deliver greater member value and drive significant growth from same store sales over time adding new sources of growth from new clubs and new formats in conjunction with our digital omnichannel capabilities i will now hand it over to maarten jager maarten o jager executive vice president chief financial officer thank you sherry let me provide some additional financial details as you heard from sherry our top line continues to be impacted by currency this quarter by 3 6 continuing the trend that we began reporting in the first quarter when it was 2 6 our headline eps number of 0 79 per share versus 0 47 per share a year ago is impacted by the 0 14 per share impact from the cost bundled under the aeropost heading along with 0 05 positive impact from a payment from a credit card vendor these two factor together represent 0 09 per share in this quarter as sherry mentioned last year s eps reflected an impact of 0 42 per share due to tax reform now on merchandise margins they came in at 14 versus 14 4 a year ago total gross margins increased to 16 1 from 15 7 a year ago mainly due to higher margins on non merchandise revenue from our aeropost marketplace and casillero legacy business units contributing 60 basis points in addition the payment and reclassification of shared income generated from co branded credit cards contributed approximately 40 basis points to our total gross margins sg a of the total business was 11 8 versus 11 2 a year ago sg a accounted for has aeropost represented 9 4 million of that or 110 basis points of the increase which was offset by impairment and acquisition deal charges in the prior period operating income was 36 5 million or 4 3 of total revenue versus 37 3 million a year ago operating income for the core warehouse club business increased to 40 8 million versus 37 3 million a year ago largely due to asset impairment and acquisition deal costs in the prior year and the credit card vendor payment in the current quarter offset by lower margins moving on to tax for the quarter the effective tax rate was 32 9 the decrease versus the 61 6 in the same quarter last year was driven by several factors us tax reform helped by 35 2 but it was partially offset by the impact of the aeropost businesses on the tax rate which represent a 3 2 consistent with our estimates in the first quarter we currently expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 37 this is higher than our first two quarters primarily due to the timing of the effects from the tax reform recall from the last earnings call that aeropost consists of both the legacy business and our investment into the pricesmart com digital platform which will drive member value in coordination with our warehouse clubs and distribution business the legacy business represented 1 7 million of net income impact for the quarter the investments into our digital platform during the past quarter represented 1 3 million of net income impact finally there are the acquisition related accounting impacts which represent a 1 2 million of net income impact for this quarter the total of these three buckets is 4 2 million or 0 14 per share as mentioned earlier moving onto the balance sheet which remains very strong the company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 98 1 million an increase of 1 2 million during the quarter we used 70 million less of cash in the quarter versus a year ago principally due to timing differences in capex projects versus a year ago during the first six months cash provided by operating activities was 76 3 million versus 59 1 million in the same quarter last year for favorable swing of 17 2 million this was primarily due to improved working capital net cash used in investing activities declined by 51 million again primarily due to differences of construction timing in last quarter along with fewer purchases of short term investments investing activities in q2 this year were associated with the construction of our four new warehouse clubs in panama the dominican republic and guatemala in summary we have seen headwinds in us dollar reported sales which were largely impacted by a continuation of foreign currency devaluation as well as some of the geopolitical and economic impacts that sherry mentioned the fundamentals of our business as evidenced by our membership counts and renewal rates our constant currency sales overall especially in colombia reinforce that we have a strong business model and significant growth opportunities we will continue to focus on the six rights driving same store sales delivering on our announced real estate pipeline and launching and continuing to develop our digitally enabled omnichannel platform our balance sheet liquidity and cash flow remain strong which provides a solid foundation for driving those same store sales and future growth that will benefit our members and shareholders alike operator we will now turn it over to q a questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question today comes from jon braatz with kansas city capital please go head jon braatz kansas city capital analyst good morning sherry maarten sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer good morning maarten o jager executive vice president chief financial officer good morning jon braatz kansas city capital analyst sherry maarten in your 10 q you talked about pricing actions to drive sales is this two questions is this in response to some new competitive pressures and can you talk a little bit about the pace of that going forward will it be similar to what you re what we re seeing now or might ease up a little bit little thoughts on few thoughts on the future maarten o jager executive vice president chief financial officer yes i mean we have taken some pricing actions as we released in mentioned in the 10 q in part because of market factors as we ve talked about we ve had economic and geopolitical influences yes competitors of course are always active but we maintain a very strong vigilance about pricing umbrella versus competitors and we have also worked to take some actions on inventory which represented some incremental markdowns on our inventory jon braatz kansas city capital analyst okay and then secondly maarten i know you don t want to starve aeropost from with starve aeropost you want to continue to grow that business how do you see the spending on aeropost going forward from the second quarter level loss per share of 0 14 sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer yes i think i d like to take that jon because with aeropost we ve got as it was envisioned sort of a basket of different components and really the vision for aeropost was that over time as we got a deeper understanding of their capabilities and what they and how they would be able to be a driver for pricesmart s core business we ve been the lines have become blurred and as a result a good chunk of what you maybe seeing as part of aeropost is there s the three components there is the acquisition cost there is the actually four components there is the cost associated with the ongoing operations of casillero which was not a primary driver for us to acquire the company but nonetheless came to us with some components that have value like logistics infrastructure post order transaction knowhow reverse logistics opportunities and various other outposts and markets that we where we exist and other locations and then there is the the marketplace portion that aeropost has which has been a sort of a resource of information for us that has helped us better inform our planning and with the deliberate approach of trying to minimize mistakes when we build on our pricesmart com site and then there is the investment in pricesmart com as well as merging and blending the technology and the talent into the core of our business which is what i referred to earlier with regard to the senior executive from aeropost who is now responsible for member experience in our company so the categories in terms of trying to decide how you characterize some of those expenses is much it s not they re not clear lines and we are right now still in the process of trying to figure that out and move for example some of the overhead that existed with aeropost operation of this business is now getting shifted over to pricesmart itself because we are investing in member experience and getting to know our members better some of the technology talent that was part of the aeropost overhead is now incorporated into the core of pricesmart s business to increase our efficiencies and to increase our technology which is something that as a retail company in today s world we need to be doing so i don t know if that exactly answers your question but we are in process right now of trying to identify how to make the most of that investment and what should become part of our ongoing just responsible management of our company and our growth plan and what of it is really just sort of one time expenses or things that are tangential to our business that we will make decisions on going forward about what we want to do with those aspects of aeropost jon braatz kansas city capital analyst so it sounds like it s just going to be very difficult to evaluate this investment solely by looking at the results you gave us on aeropost because as you said the lines are being blurred and you just can t look at the aeropost numbers in isolation it s just not going to give us a true picture of what s really going on is that a fair assessment sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer it may not be the answer you wanted to hear but i couldn t think of a better summation of it because frankly we re doing what s right for the business we are taking our time and we re looking at where can we make the most of what we ve acquired and we re learning about the individuals involved we re learning more about the technology and we re strategically pulling those and applying them where we are going to get the best return in our view to drive the core pricesmart business and it s not a neat and tidy analysis that we can just sort of lay out numbers for you i do expect though in the future that this will clear up more and we ll be able to categorize better this chunk of for example the expenses associated with aeropost has now been incorporated into the very core business of pricesmart this aspect of it is more directly related to for example casillero and we are working on building that kind of an explanation we don t have it done yet and in part it s because some of it is overlapping and those lines are blurred jon braatz kansas city capital analyst okay thank you very much maarten o jager executive vice president chief financial officer this is maarten jager i d just like to make an important clarifications clarification on the number of clubs in our markets we have in the caribbean 12 in central america we have 22 and in colombia seven sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer i reversed the club numbers in my portion of the comments at the beginning so we wanted to make that correction operator operator instructions the next question comes from ronald bookbinder with ifs securities please go ahead ronald bookbinder ifs securities inc analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions first columbia comps seem to be slowing is that simply because of currency or is there something else going on there just the tough comparisons versus last year or sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer our interpretation is different frankly yes i guess if you were to look at it strictly in terms of us dollars the comps have been negatively impacted to a significant degree i think i gave you specifics in the range of 9 but if you were to look at it in terms of local currency you would see a very different picture in terms of the comps ronald bookbinder ifs securities inc analyst okay so it is currency and then food seemed to be one of your stronger categories and you source that locally and so currency shouldn t be having an impact on that as much as the products that get brought in from miami is that why that seems to be doing better or how would you look at that in a constant currency basis sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer i think that it s a mixed bag i mean i think on the one hand you re right but we still have significant foods that are imported but the bottom line is that people are buying in local currency and when we have to translate that back to us dollars there is an impact on the as a result of the fx because we report our comps on us dollars ronald bookbinder ifs securities inc analyst correct okay central america its performance was consistent with the prior two quarters should we expect it to stay negative in the back half of this year as you know these political problems and sort of a bit of a slowing economy there just continues sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer that s something i think we re all watching the news almost daily to try to get our arms around we are definitely experiencing in multiple markets extraordinary external pressures nicaragua it s all over the news trump s proclamations about cutting aid off to some of the countries that where we have el salvador guatemala honduras where we have clubs these external pressures are just a it s a matter of common knowledge and so we have to be prepared for that but it s no secret that we operate in challenging markets and we have for quite some time but these are markets where we feel we also have tremendous opportunity and we bring to the table very valuable concepts and we bring a business with tremendous value proposition for our members and for the markets and also for the shareholders but we ve got to weather these storms and we ve got to be smart about how we nimble about how we handle those things that are beyond our control how we respond to them in an effective way and i think predicting the political future in these markets and the socioeconomic future we do our homework but it s by no means something guaranteed in terms of how it s going to play out so i can t give you any more intelligence on that than what we all are seeing in the news maarten o jager executive vice president chief financial officer the two things to add if i can on colombia i just went back to the last kind of five quarters round of constant currency sales and they ve all been double digits north of 10 so as sherry said we re not seeing a dip and then in terms of not predicting obviously we can t predict around the business predicting the geopolitical issues and outcomes but it is true that in nicaragua we will be anniversarying anniversarying sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer anniversarying maarten o jager executive vice president chief financial officer thank you the nicaragua riots starting in kind of late spring early summer we ll start to anniversary those numbers ronald bookbinder ifs securities inc analyst okay and lastly the new regional dc could you give us some additional color as to when you expect that to be fully operational and the benefits that we could see as that really starts to roll out sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer the costa rica regional distribution center is a major area of focus for our management team right now and we are already starting to see some benefits of that by way of concessions that vendors are providing but it is a large undertaking it s a very strategic investment for us and we continue to evaluate and reevaluate how to make the most of that obviously when you re able to plan for inventory flow for seven clubs and have a regional distribution center that can make better judgment calls as to what to flow to the and pause to the specific clubs that can allow for some significant improvements as well in terms of our inventory flow but the we re right in the depths of figuring out the very best ways to create savings create efficiencies and be able to pass that value onto the member in the context of improving the overall operations and supply chain of our business ronald bookbinder ifs securities inc analyst so i m bit surprised you re getting vendor concessions by i guess shipping directly there to the regional dc shouldn t that be able to provide extra gross margin that you ll be able to cut prices to provide better value for your members to drive more revenue to leverage more sg a and continue to drive profitability sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer have you been studying our cycle of big path ronald bookbinder ifs securities inc analyst just want to make that clear sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer well well when you ve got vendors who don t have to make seven different stops through seven different clubs they can go to one location i mean there is a basic at least there s a starting point for discussion there as to whether or not we can partner with our vendors make business easier on them motivate them to share some of their savings with us so that we can in turn provide better value to our members so i think you ve nailed it ronald bookbinder ifs securities inc analyst okay great thank you for taking my questions and good luck in the back half of the year sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer all right thank you so much operator the next question comes from donatas uzkurelis with lgm investments please go ahead donatas uzkurelis lgm investments analyst hello thank you very much for the call and i have a number of questions let s start with the four new clubs and plan for this calendar year could you give us some color on pre opening expenses how much have you booked let s say in this quarter and how much we should expect in the next few quarters also can you talk little bit about your cannibalization expectations on those clubs also certainly four new clubs is almost 10 as you mentioned to the total club number how should we think about the financial year 2020 from that perspective is there a chance for you to have more clubs in addition to the four planned for that year and also can you talk a little bit about your margin your operating margin has been it was lower year on year but it s been better than the last two quarters as far as i can see how should we think about it now going forward should we see more pressure on it or some improvement that s it for now thank you maarten o jager executive vice president chief financial officer sorry the third question was unclear to us the first one was about the clubs and pre opening expenses the second one was about cannibalization expectations donatas uzkurelis lgm investments analyst yes sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer there were four what were the third and fourth donatas uzkurelis lgm investments analyst new openings for 2020 and also how should we think about your margins going forward sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer all right well i ll start with some general comments and i m sure maarten is going to have some more in depth insights for you on this basically we we don t share that level of detail on our expenses in terms of the planned expenses for pre opening of the four clubs i can tell you that we have a very well established approach for handling the pre opening and for new member sign ups and for getting the word out and building membership to attract them to the clubs and with regard to veraguas i could see i m sorry not veraguas but bolivar given that we are promoting our club that is an enhanced or different depending on how you look at it concepts from what we ve traditionally done i could see a little bit more expense there an investment there it may not all be our expense it could include vendors who are excited about what we re doing and wanting to participate so we are looking at doing slightly more there to inform and educate our membership about the additional value and opportunities from this new concept but generally speaking i don t see our pre opening expenses to be anything outside the norm again with a slight exception of what we talked about on bolivar and i think that s about all the color i can give you on that generally maarten o jager executive vice president chief financial officer and what we booked in the current quarter is in the 10 q sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer right with regard to cannibalization i mean our efforts are to try to identify locations where we think are going to be additive and veraguas is one of the is the next club to open up it s a smaller format it s in a more remote location relative to you know where we are in our other locations in panama city and it s intended to draw upon a slightly different demographic with a more targeted merchandise plan that s responsive to that area so it s been planned for thoughtfully to minimize cannibalization but nonetheless it s hard to predict exactly what the cannibalization will be let s say what did you talk about going forward for 2020 the new openings we do not announce new openings at least that s not our current practice until we have a signed contract and secured a location and have a legal commitment basically to go forward so i can t give you any more color on that at this point but as soon as we have and there are others that we are exploring and negotiating and actively working on that are in the pipeline and as we re able to to release those we will release them to the market with regard to more pressure what was the last one donatas uzkurelis lgm investments analyst on margins sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer with regard to margins you know again our business model is to try to reduce margins through better efficiencies while generating a reasonable profit and this is the core discipline for our company and one that s different from what you might see with traditional retailers this is a key differentiator between us as a club model and your standard retailer so again we do have to respond from time to time due to competitive factors due to external factors due to currency fluctuations and that causes us to adjust margins where appropriate but i do want to get across clearly that our goal is to be successful in being able to reduce margins so that s about as much color as i can provide and maarten if you would like to fill anything out please do maarten o jager executive vice president chief financial officer i don t think everything is well said i did mention on the pre opening expenses for the quarter we booked 97 000 as is in the q and on cannibalization we do very detailed models market studies traffic flows demographics household income demographics and we look of course at the impact of the new club on the other clubs and look at the business case on an incremental economic value creation basis as you would expect us to do but other than that i have nothing else to add operator thank you very much i will now turn it over to you operator thank you this concludes our question and answer session and also concludes our conference thank you for attending today and you can now disconnect sherry s
