the year of 2019 kept the currency market busy shifting between a risk on and a risk off sentiment on the back of central bank actions and geopolitical events across the globe the rupee inr lost 2 3 per cent against the dollar usd last year while this may seem better compared with its performance in 2018 where the indian currency lost 9 2 per cent it largely remained one of the weakest asian currencies in 2019 compared with other major currencies the rupee lost 0 23 per cent against the euro eur 5 97 per cent against the british pound gbp and 3 45 per cent against the japanese yen jpy record inflows as per national securities depository ltd nsdl data on foreign portfolio investment fpi the domestic market received a net inflow of nearly 1 36 lakh crore equity and debt combined in 2019 compared with a net outflow of 80 919 crore during year 2018 according to rbi data india received increased foreign direct investment fdi inflows during the january september period last year compared with the corresponding period the year before fdi increased to 27 2 billion from 23 9 billion during the same period external commercial borrowing ecb by corporates also increased the demand for rupee ecb inflows saw a significant jump to 16 7 billion compared with a meagre 1 5 billion the year before the balance of payments bop too improved the current account deficit cad during january september in 2019 narrowed to 25 2 billion from 47 8 billion during the same period in 2018 trade deficit the largest component of cad contracted to 119 5 billion from 137 4 billion as imports for the period decelerated while exports remained flat what weighed one of the factors that might have weighed on the rupee could be the increasing trend in consumer price index cpi the inflation spiked to 7 35 per cent in december from 1 97 in january another factor could be the reduction in the benchmark rate by the reserve bank of india the rbi reduced repo rate by 135 basis points from 6 5 per cent to 5 15 per cent in 2019 importantly india s forex reserves increased by 61 6 billion to 454 95 from 393 29 billion in 2019 meaning the rbi had been buying the dollar thereby keeping a check on the rupee to support exports inflation on an upward path can have a negative impact on a domestic currency so the rbi may not opt for further rate cuts if the inflation continues to head north while the rising inflation can exert pressure on the rupee the indian central bank restraining from further rate cuts can be favourable to the local currency as higher interest rates can attract capital inflows this is especially true considering that the us federal reserve is expected to keep its policy rate at current levels 1 75 per cent throughout 2020 as per the latest dot plot while the slowdown in the domestic economy might translate to lesser imports a continued weakness in global demand could dent the scope for exporters contributing to the uncertainty in the global situation is the rising protectionism cites federation of indian export organisations fieo however in india s exports outlook fieo forecasts exports to pick up in the first half of 2020 auguring well for the rupee india being an import dependent nation in crude the global price trend in the commodity is always a concern for the country s foreign exchange compared with the 2019 average price of 56 74 a barrel the us energy information administration eia expects the average price of west texas intermediate wti oil to drop marginally to 55 01 a barrel in 2020 consistent supply and a projected increase in inventories are expected to put a cap on crude prices thereby not threatening india s crude bill market sentiment is a major contributor to short term volatility and price trends tensions in west asia is ebbing away and brexit has not been a disruptor so far then there is the trade deal between the us and china now that the phase 1 deal has been signed the likelihood of a trade conflict henceforth seems low all these factors should help improve the market sentiment resulting in a demand for riskier assets that would mean more inflow to india keeping the rupee afloat outlook while inflationary risk persists comparatively high interest rates will provide cushion for the indian currency the other factor in favour of the rupee is a possible improvement in trade balance on the back of better exports and subdued crude oil prices as foreign exchange reserves are at record levels any unexpected spike in the exchange rate would be effectively managed by the rbi on the other hand the rbi might also avert a sharp surge in the rupee to maintain competitiveness in the global market considering these factors the rupee is expected to largely stay within 69 and 72 against the dollar during the year share copy link email facebook twitter telegram linkedin whatsapp reddit

with tory newmyer the ticker just over three years ago president trump gazed beyond the west front of the capitol and pronounced a nation in a state of carnage it struck many both then and now as odd at the time the united states was in the middle of an economic recovery that was leading to steady job growth lower unemployment and slightly smaller annual budget deficits trump has often boasted that his economic record is a result of his actions alone in his address to the world economic forum in davos on tuesday the president contrasted the dismal state of his predecessor with an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before the president is correct that as of this point in his tenure some economic indicators are at or near record highs or improving for some people after remaining stagnant the dow jones has posted record numbers unemployment has continued its downward trajectory to a half century low and wages are starting to increase for the middle class though as our colleagues and others have noted trump often exaggerates the unemployment rate for african americans and latinos advertisement but that s not the full story the upward trajectory of many economic metrics ranging from unemployment to the stock market began under president barack obama as our colleague heather long wrote last year the data shows a mixed picture in terms of whether the economy is any better than it was in obama s final years trump will head into his reelection effort with a modernized north american free trade agreement and an introductory deal with china but to get there tariff man took wall street on a dizzying ride imposing tariffs on multiple u s allies and asking congress and therefore the american people to foot the bill for a bailout of american farmers larger than the amount provided to save the auto industry even some of the president s allies admit the trade wars smothered some of the gains from the republican led rewrite of the tax code which as tory has pointed out also failed to live up to its hype so on the heels of his davos address and at the start of his fourth year in office we decided to see how the trump economy stacks up to the 2016 candidate s promises such as that he alone could fix it for our purposes we are squarely focused on trump s economic record though our colleague glenn kessler found that overall trump has broken more key promises than he s kept our trump promise tracker follows the progress of 60 key promises made by the president during the 2016 campaign video the washington post jobs advertisement promise create 25 million new jobs over the next decade this was this core of candidate trump s economic plan unveiled in september 2016 status in progress but unlikely to happen over the next decade based on the current trajectory there have been almost 6 7 million jobs created since trump took office according to the bureau of labor statistics we used the agency s preliminary numbers for december 2019 as the endpoint that puts trump off pace to create 25 million jobs by 2026 but also as factcheck org pointed out trailing the average monthly jobs gain from obama s second term the good news is experts say job gains as heather noted remain surprisingly robust given the large number of baby boomers retiring and the difficulty business owners have in filling new jobs trade promise pull out of the trans pacific partnership on day 1 renegotiate the north american free trade agreement nafta or leave the accord as part of his america first approach trump also vowed to get a better deal for american consumers by toeing a tougher line with major world markets he says are routinely ripping off the united states including china trump initially promised to impose a 45 percent tariff on chinese imports advertisement status the president withdrew from the tpp on day 3 of his presidency he threatened repeatedly to end u s participation in nafta but instead renegotiated what he said was a better deal with mexico and canada the senate passed the u s mexico canada agreement last week in a sweeping bipartisan vote which could help the president s reelection chances on china trump never imposed a 45 percent tariff on imports but he has repeatedly used and imposed tariffs against chinese imports in a bid to stop what he views as discriminatory trade practices for now the administration s goal of a sweeping trade accord with china has remained elusive instead both sides signed a limited phase one deal maintaining many tariffs as high as 25 percent some of beijing s retaliatory tariffs remain in place but the phase 1 deal does include a chinese pledge to purchase tens of billions in u s agricultural products over the next two years advertisement growth promise over the next 10 years our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3 5 percent growth trump told the new york economic club in september 2016 before adding the 25 million new jobs line that we already addressed status very unlikely given that current average yearly economic growth is nowhere close the gdp has failed to increase at an average of even 3 percent in any of trump s first three years in office the latest estimate for 2019 calls for 2 2 percent growth which would be the lowest so far during his administration when trump originally made the promise economists journalists commentators and pretty much everyone pointed out the united states hadn t reached 3 5 percent annual growth since 2004 bill clinton was the last president to post more than one year above that threshold in a press conference from davos wednesday morning trump economic adviser larry kudlow said trade deals like the usmca and phase one china deal would inspire a half point growth in gdp in the year ahead debt advertisement promise reduce the federal debt by 19 trillion over eight years status extremely unlikely as the debt is actually increasing trump has done the exact opposite of what he promised in this category as the gross federal debt has risen about 16 percent since he s taken office according to politifact under trump s watch the annual increase in the national debt has continued to surpass the growth in the nation s gdp a big reason for the growing gap is the 1 5 trillion in tax cuts spread out across the next decade as part of the president s tax overhaul and the president s continued endorsement of huge spending plans for the government not surprisingly trump has reportedly scoffed at torching the nation s balance sheet yeah but i won t be here trump said during a meeting last year according to the daily beast s asawin suebsaen and lachlan markay referring to a spike he was shown in the debt following a possible second term in office market movers trump hit a lot of economic notes in an impromptu news conference this morning from the wef in davos here are some of the highlights advertisement trump said he would be negotiating a whole new structure for the wto and the trade organization head would soon be coming to washington the wto has been very very unfair to the united states for many years trump complained adding china wouldn t have certain economic advantages without it trump said he has a date in mind as to when he would place heavy new tariffs on european cars but didn t share it they are actually more difficult to do business with than china just ask boris johnson the president said referring to the european union when asked about whether human rights and hong kong protests would factor into dealings with china trump said this we would like to see if we can do something but again we re doing a trade deal the president also said his administration would soon announce additional countries to be added to the u s travel ban ceos remain optimistic at davos chief executives converged here hopeful that easing trade tensions around the world could give the economy a boost despite some early dismal forecasts for global growth and business sentiment the wall street journal s chip cummins and marie beaudette report a closely followed survey of ceo sentiment kicked off this year s world economic forum on a somber note consulting firm pwc found that 53 percent of those it surveyed predict a slowdown in economic growth in 2020 up sharply from 29 percent in 2019 and 5 percent in 2018 it was the highest level of pessimism since 2012 the first year of the survey pwc said the oecd predicts global growth of 3 percent this year up only slightly from its 2 9 percent forecast for 2019 the weakest growth rate since the financial crisis advertisement netflix shares rise despite some weak performance shares of netflix climbed as much as 2 3 in after hours trading after the company reported fourth quarter results the company beat on the top and bottom lines for the quarter but gave disappointing guidance for the first quarter cnbc s annie palmer reports for the first quarter of 2020 netflix expects to report earnings of 1 66 per share on revenue of 5 73 billion that s compared to analyst expectations for earnings of 1 20 per share and 5 76 billion in revenue the company also expects to

to put hefty tariffs on european cars tuesday at the world economic forum promising hardball tactics if trade negotiations do not go his way our colleague heather long reports from davos advertisement just days after trump scored wins with china mexico and canada the move highlighted how trump is quickly pivoting to make europe the next front in his protectionist trade war as part of this push

as the global oligarchy assembles at the world economic forum in davos switzerland there are growing warning signs that global debt fueled by cheap money from central banks is a ticking time bomb rising trade tensions lower investment weak confidence and high debt risk a prolonged slowdown of the world economy noted the world economic forum s annual global risks report global debt is on track to reach an all time high of more than 257 trillion in the coming months after surging by around 9 trillion in the first three quarters of 2019 according to a report issued by the institute for international finance iif earlier this month total debt now amounts to 32 500 for each member of the world s population of 7 7 billion and stands at 320 percent of global gross domestic product in the major economies total debt is 180 trillion equivalent to 383 percent of their combined gdp total government debt is more than 65 trillion up from 37 trillion a decade ago with the government debt to gdp ratio at an all time high in the us and australia non financial corporate debt rose to more than 72 trillion last year and is now at a record high of 92 percent of gdp household debt has risen to 46 trillion the institute of international finance noted that debt growth in china is on the rise again as the economy slows following a marked slowdown in 2017 18 during the big push for deleveraging debt accumulation in china picked up again notably in the non financial corporate sector it said total chinese debt is now close to 310 percent of gdp one of the highest in so called emerging markets the report by the iif follows similar findings by the world bank in a report issued last month the world bank said that since 2010 there had been a fourth global debt wave which had led to developing countries accumulating a towering 55 trillion of debt the highest level in history it noted that the three previous debt waves had ended in crises the latin american crisis of the 1980s the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 the rise in debt is the product of the injection of trillions of dollars into financial markets by the world s major central banks quantitative easing in response to the global financial crisis and the reduction of interest rates to record lows the major effect of these measures has been to create another bubble in financial markets as stock prices attain record highs thereby creating the conditions for another collapse potentially even more serious than that of 2008 the signs of such a crisis are already apparent an article in the financial times on monday warned that the developing world s rapidly swelling corporate debt market is an accident waiting to happen citing a letter to investors by a major hedge fund gramercy funds management wrote that there was a risk of sudden dislocations as money was quickly pulled out we are convinced that liquid markets are not necessarily liquid robert koenigsberger the chief investment officer wrote in a letter co signed by prominent financial analyst mohamed el erian a senior advisor to the fund the perfect dislocation storm waiting to happen the lowering of interest rates leading to negative returns on around 11 trillion of bonds on the latest count has led to a shift into riskier investments in the search for higher yield as a result according to the financial times the emerging market corporate bond market has expanded almost fourfold to 2 3 trillion in the past decade with the high yield sector increasing almost five fold when the system is tested koenigsberger told the newspaper it is reasonable to expect that it will fail a test could come in the form of a rapid rise in financial uncertainty possibly sparked by a recession or a crisis in one country another potential risk factor is the growth of emerging market debt denominated in a hard currency such as the us dollar which becomes increasingly difficult to pay back if the local currency experiences a rapid devaluation hard currency debt reached 8 3 trillion in the third quarter of last year an increase of 4 trillion over the past decade the potential for a debt crisis is being increased by the continuing slowdown in the world economy in its latest update issued to coincide with the world economic forum in davos the international monetary fund cut its growth forecast for 2020 from 3 4 percent to 3 3 percent and reduced the forecast for next year from 3 6 to 3 4 percent these figures are only marginally above the 2 9 percent growth rate in 2019 the worst year since the financial crisis of 2008 2009 the figure would have been even lower had the us fed and other major central banks not cut interest rates in the second half of last year imf managing director kristalina georgieva said 71 interest rate cuts by 49 central banks last year marked the most synchronized monetary easing since the global financial crisis she added that without them we would have technically been talking about recession an annual survey of almost 1 600 chief executives from 83 countries conducted by pwc and released as the davos meeting began found that more than half expected a decline in growth in 2020 compared with 29 percent last year and just 5 percent in 2018 they said their companies were under more pressure than at any time in the past 11 years however us president trump brushed all these concerns aside in his keynote address to the davos meeting yesterday as he extolled the policies of his administration declaring it was a time for optimism i m proud to declare that the us is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen he declared america s economic turnaround has been nothing short of spectacular this is a blue collar boom the american dream is back bigger better and stronger than ever this pack of lies is exposed on every front american economic growth is hovering at just above 2 percent the lowest level for any recovery in the post world war ii period far from lifting the living standards of american workers what growth is taking place is highly concentrated within the financial oligarchy the much vaunted tax cuts launched by the administration at the end of 2017 have not led to an increase in investment and well paying jobs but have been used almost exclusively to finance share buybacks in order to boost the stock market at the same time corporate debt has risen to nearly 10 trillion equivalent to 47 percent of gdp with the weakest firms accounting for much of the increase as they

heated venture capitalist valuations since that time growth momentum started to slow whether this was the turning point in an unusually long growth value cycle has yet to be determined but we welcomed more valuation based investment behavior we achieved outperformance in the fourth quarter but lagged the msci world benchmark in the prior three quarters much of this was attributable to the fund s underweight in the u s market which continued to outpace most non u s markets we were overweight and outperformed in the vast majority of other countries including european developed regions of the u

strategy competing trends continue to muddle the direction of the global economy industrial production figures are slowing down which indicates that industrials and similarly positioned sectors like materials and construction could get weaker yet the service sectors which comprise up to 75 of gross domestic product in many countries show considerable strength corporate capital spending has slowed as companies are wary of on going u s china trade frictions and weak bellwether industry metrics like industrial production and trade flow data yet retail spending has continued unabated with consumers seemingly unfazed by the trade tensions with no clear trajectory markets may experience volatility in coming quarters and we hope to capitalize on downturns to purchase watch list stocks as we enter a new decade we are excited about the changes in technology advances in healthcare continued emerging market growth and all the opportunities and disruptions that will ensue we are also mindful of the headwinds we may face excessive deficit spending geopolitical upheaval potential asset bubbles and liquidity crises to name a few at polaris we remain committed to our value discipline

privilege even in the absence of a claim of executive privilege it is the duty of congress to have the dispute decided by the judicial branch the separation of powers and the impeachment process is basic civics and protects our democracy from the tyranny of the majority the impeachment articles do not allege criminal conduct and unlike the three other presidential impeachments in our 230 year history as a constitutional republic it is not bipartisan the only bipartisan votes have been against impeachment i also would not support censure because speaking for republicans we are tired of being pushed around by the radical left we support the president for the incredible progress he has made on illegal immigration the economy with jobs and wage growth nuclear testing in north korea resisting expansion of worldwide terrorism by iran standing up to china on trade support of israel re negotiating trade with canada and mexico and many other accomplishments plans for impeachment according to the washington post began before president trump was sworn in articles impeachment efforts in the house have failed twice before the russia collusion muller investigation lasted 675 days there were 2 800 subpoenas 500 witness depositions and requests for information from 13 foreign governments the investigation cost the american taxpayers 40 million articles of impeachment were promised then and not delivered some house members have promised to continue impeachment efforts after the president is acquitted the impeachment of president trump is a gift from the house democrats for our country to have a united republican federal government after november 2020 after that i will help president trump get the work done on immigration and health care for we the people how would you reduce the federal budget deficit which now stands at about 1 trillion for 2020 what changes if any to the u s tax code do you support and why while there are a number of opportunities to cut spending by addressing low hanging fruit like duplication of services and government waste the best way to reduce the deficit is to address our spending addiction with zero based budgeting across the board we need to require government agencies to justify their spending based on needs and not simply increases in every category based on what they spent the year before i support making the trump tax cuts permanent because even blue states benefited from an increase of tax revenue dick durbin fought against the trump tax cuts yet in 2018 tax revenue in illinois increased by 1 5 billion when the economy grows state tax revenues increase economic growth with low taxes and regulatory relief on business will lead to increased revenues for the federal government which will help reduce the deficit what changes would you like to see made to our nation s healthcare system would you shore up the affordable care act or work to repeal it in full what s your view on medicare for all and what should be done if anything to bring down the cost of prescription drugs i do not support a single payer health care system medicare for all is a lie it is a single payer system that prohibits cost sharing another report came out in may 2019 other than the muller report and that was a report of the congressional budget office on a single payer health care system which was requested by house democrats the report explains fundamental economic truths that when a service is perceived as free the demand for that service increases the only way to control costs in that case is to reduce services rationing of care and to reduce reimbursement loss of providers there are 104 democrat sponsors in the house and 14 in the senate of a single payer health care plan dick durbin supports medicare for all and i do not he says that health care is a right not just for the wealthy of course health care is a right the wealthy will take their health care dollars where they get value a good outcome for a low cost about 60 000 canadians cross our border each year to purchase health care services india s medical travel industry will bring in 9 billion in 2020 with a single payer plan i also worry about a harmful decline in medical research and innovation there are sensible market driven solutions to reducing the cost of healthcare in the united states i truly believe that we do not need to spend 17 5 of gdp on health care dick durbin says that he wants doctors to treat patients and not spend our time fighting insurance companies fighting insurance companies pale in comparison to the 34 billion we spend staying in compliance with medicare regulations most of which have nothing to do with patient safety and health outcomes i will work for americans to have access to the best medical care in the world while instituting commonsense policies that make health care and insurance more affordable this includes price and outcome transparency expanded dollar amount and uses of health savings accounts hsas regulatory relief on providers and hospitals malpractice tort reform small business insurance pools low cost short term insurance plans and primary care membership plans the trump administration is awaiting a ruling from the supreme court as to whether it can end the daca program deferred action for childhood arrivals which shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation do you support or oppose daca and why should a path to citizenship be created for the so called dreamers please explain the constitutionality of the executive order for daca by president obama will be decided by the supreme court supporting or not supporting daca isn t the right question for a candidate the question is before the supreme court supporting or not supporting the dreamers is the real question the dreamers are a special category of illegal immigrants they are special not because many would make great citizens who have made contributions they are not special because dick durbin pleads their case on the well of the senate with big pictures of beautiful doe eyed young adults who have not committed crimes they are special because they have registered with the federal government and have visas no other illegal immigrants have this privilege i do not support illegal immigration and i certainly do not support government services such as healthcare education driver s licenses and the privileges of citizenship for illegal immigrants however for the small proportion known as dreamers i will support an expedited pathway to citizenship for the 900 who have served in our armed forces for the 8 or nearly 60 000 dreamers who have criminal records according to the united states citizenship and immigration services they can achieve legal resident status after paying their debt to society but should not have a pathway to citizenship for the remaining 91 i would support a point system with time to citizenship dependent on work history educational attainment community service and desire to assimilate to our society what are the three most important issues in your district on which the federal government can and should act the most important issue is immigration i will support full funding of the department of homeland security appropriation request to fully fund customs and border protection cbp with a wall and technology i will support the cbp air and marine vision and strategy 2030 ten year plan to keep our country secure i do not believe a comprehensive immigration bill is possible big comprehensive legislation fails and we need wins in addition to the department of homeland security appropriations i would support federal legislation to deal with asylum claims and illegal border crossings i would like to have more immigration judges and courtrooms on the border in addition to the family detention facilities the asylum claim backlog needs to be resolved asylum claims need to be adjudicated fairly and humanely but much more expeditiously illegal immigrants should not be released into the interior with little hope of a voluntary court appearance illegal immigrants who have a criminal history need to be deported illegal immigrants should not be allowed an asylum claim if they traveled through another country without seeking asylum in that country i will support legislation ending birthright citizenship and the court can decide if the legislation violates the 14th amendment which was ratified in order to allow children of former slaves citizenship american babies born overseas are not citizens of countries where they are born our legal immigration system is outdated the number of h1 and h2 visas needs to be constantly evaluated to accommodate the needs of our country for those legal immigrants who seek a pathway to citizenship the number allowed each year needs to be based on our country s needs the family based chain migration system needs to transition to a merit based system that serves the future needs of america to this end country caps and the lottery need to be eliminated we need more immigration not less we need to expand the american family to those who will contribute and assimilate my neighbors are americans who are from hungary syria and jordan we are christian muslim and jewish our kids grew up together and we celebrate independence day together we need more not less legal immigration for the future of our great nation another crucial issue is standing with president trump against socialism and helping him continue to grow our booming economy despite dick durbin s opposition the 2017 tax cuts and regulatory relief on business have stimulated our economy the unemployment rate is at a historic low in all racial groups women and individuals without a high school diploma the u s leads the world in wage and salary growth and hundreds of billions in profits have come back from overseas i support making the tax cuts permanent cutting spending to reduce the national debt reducing the regulatory burden on small businesses and balancing our budget the third most important issue is healthcare as i ve mentioned i ve been a doctor in illinois for 23 years i will ensure americans continue to have access to the best medical care in the world while instituting commonsense policies that make health care and insurance more affordable this includes price and outcome transparency insurance sold across state lines expanded health savings accounts hsas regulatory relief on providers and hospitals malpractice tort reform small business insurance pools low cost short term insurance plans and primary care membership plans what is the biggest difference between you and your opponent s knowledge of the issues is the biggest difference there is no republican or democrat candidate for united states senator in illinois who has more experience and who is more knowledgeable on u s healthcare policy than me this will be the number one issue in the general election in addition to the usual campaign engagements i read and i do my homework i know what i don t know and i work very hard to understand the issues from immigration reform to the farm bureau legislative agenda to veterans issues to energy policy etc i don t hear anything in depth on the issues that affect the citizens of illinois from my opponents they throw out a lot of red meat which may serve them to a certain point in a republican primary but i trust that the voters will know who they can trust to represent them in the senate the greatest deliberative body on earth my work ethic also translates into a more advanced campaign i have raised the most money spent the least done state wide polling by a firm that has polled for the rnc and i have hired my political team i anticipate earning the republican nomination for united states senate in illinois what action should congress take if any to reduce gun violence i am committed to the protection of a citizen s right to keep and bear arms citizens have a right to protect themselves there are already many restrictions on ownership of firearms local authorities not congress have the duty to protect their neighbors from gun violence congress should direct the department of education to provide schools with guidelines to protect students and to harden schools to reduce the risk of gun violence is climate change real is it significantly man made is it a threat to humankind what if anything should congress and the federal government do about it there is general consensus that the climate is changing but the degree to which human activity contributes is debatable no one is saying the climate isn t changing but we need to develop realistic solutions that don t destroy our economy further overburden our taxpayers and make americans less safe by making us dependent again on countries that wish to do us harm one of president trump s least heralded accomplishments is increasing our domestic energy production to the point where we are now a net energy exporter and fully energy independent which is a significant accomplishment that makes our country safer and more prosperous we should be taking steps to improve our environment and reduce our carbon footprint the best solution is increasing our nuclear energy here in illinois nuclear energy generates 52 of our state s electricity while emitting no greenhouse gases it is also our most reliable power source producing electricity around the clock on a bigger scale nuclear energy provides 55 of our country s clean energy making it the largest domestic source of clean energy and the most reliable energy source the american government has put billions of dollars into the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository that was shut down under the obama administration we need a central repository for waste that is open and utilized we have the ability right now to increase nuclear energy in america to lower greenhouse gases and create jobs the alternative green new deal would destroy our economy and reduce our energy independence what should congress do to ensure the solvency of social security and medicare social security is misunderstood by most americans it was designed as a trust fund when the average life expectancy was 61 years in those days with a retirement age that hasn t changed if a retiree got a check he beat the odds but the trust fund has been raided over the years for other government programs and ious were issued with each raid now the ious are running out and the system will be insolvent by 2037 the trust fund is not interest bearing and is a ruse today a trillion dollars goes into the fund through taxes and a little more than a trillion dollars goes out in benefits there is no fund there are only so many options for saving the social security system which was originally intended for the elderly who had no other income the options are 1 raise social taxes 2 index the retirement age to the average life expectancy 3 make the benefit the same for everyone so that higher paid beneficiaries would receive less and lower paid beneficiaries would be paid more and 4 allow a portion of the social security withholding to be invested in an interest bearing instrument like an ira for those citizens who elect to do so i personally prefer a combination of options 2 3 and 4 social security can be saved but the more time that is wasted by career politicians the more difficult the will be medicare is tied to social security and the same solutions apply what should congress do to address the student loan crisis would you use the word crisis there are no circumstances in which the taxpayers should favor a single subset of individuals and pay off their debts our tax dollars should be going towards keeping our country safe and growing our economy so those benefits can be enjoyed by all our citizens at 67 i am still paying off student loans from medical school i have not and will not look for the american taxpayers to assist me i believe in personal responsibility and not government handouts i believe we need to teach our children to take responsibility for their futures if they do so we ll see more of our young people make smart decisions as to their educational paths including looking to lower cost secondary education or pursuing careers in manufacturing and the trades where skilled labor is desperately needed and young people can have lucrative and rewarding careers i would support a loan forgiveness program for doctors teachers engineers and other professions to have student loan relief if they decide to work in underserved areas part of their form of payment could go towards loan relief without giving away government handouts that hurt our taxpayers what should our nation s relationship be with russia there are many areas where we don t agree with russia and have to be strict with them but there are areas where we need to be diplomatic with russia we need to be trading partners with russia as they have one of the biggest economies in the world we also need to have open educational and diplomatic exchange between our two counties but at the same time we must fight back against russian aggression whether it is interfering with our elections or military aggression in europe on a personal level my wife and i were able to adopt our three beautiful sons from russia when relations were better between our countries unfortunately americans can no longer adopt children from russia i anticipate that relations will be more normal after putin is no longer in charge until then we need to be polite and firm what s your view on the use of tariffs in international commerce has president trump imposed tariffs properly and effectively please explain president trump s approach has brought countries with which we have unfair trade deals to the table to renegotiate i applaud president trump for his leadership on the united states mexico canada agreement that eliminates nafta and creates freer markets fairer trade and robust economic growth in north america in illinois particularly the usmca is a huge win for our farmers manufacturers and businesses that do trade with our neighboring north american countries china has been taking advantage of the united states for far too long the united states has been losing money and intellectual property while china has been reaping the benefits in early december the united states and china reached a historic phase one agreement that benefits our intellectual property technology transfer agriculture financial services and currency and foreign exchange we must continue to renegotiate decade old trade agreements to put america first and create fairer trade between us and other countries while the tariffs initially called for a temporary sacrifice among the agriculture and manufacturing sectors our economic future already looks much brighter based on president trump s leadership on trade agreements does the united states have a responsibility to promote democracy in other countries please explain many countries around the world look to the united states as the beacon of hope and the example of democracy as the freest and democratic country in the world we should promote that for all countries around the world if a nation seeks our help to preserve their democracy or seek our advice on how to build a democratic society we should help what we should not do is exert dominance in countries by nation building that could potentially lead to upheaval and conflict unfortunately we have tried too hard in the past to nation build and have been caught up in never ending conflicts that put our service men and women in harm s way and cost our country billions in treasure what should congress do to limit the proliferation of nuclear arms we first need to be more proactive against countries like iran and north korea who pose serious threats to countries around the world with their efforts to gain nuclear arms we have seen firsthand how president trump s leadership has halted north korea s nuclear testing we must work with our allies to cut off the supply of materials used in making nuclear weapons we should work with our allies and international nuclear arms agencies like the united nations office for disarmament affairs to monitor counties to ensure they are complying with treaties and not maliciously producing nuclear arms we also need to develop common sense treaties with allied countries and countries who wish to produce nuclear arms to keep americans and our allies safe these treaties should have no sunset clauses or misinterpretations like the joint comprehensive plan of action please list all relatives on public or campaign payrolls and their jobs on those payrolls my wife works for the sangamon county republican central committee as an administrative assistant to the chairman my son andrei works in the sangamon county circuit court clerk s office what historical figure from illinois other than abraham lincoln because everybody s big on abe do you most admire or draw inspiration from please explain my great great grandfather james h howard who served in the last years of the civil war he was a selfless man who served in the civil war out of conviction to preserve the union he enlisted in place of his oldest son who was drafted he left his farm in waukegan illinois to put his life on the line to preserve the union as one of the older men in the war he quickly rose to the rank of sergeant and became a father figure to the men in his company i ve read over a hundred letters he wrote home during his time in the civil war he was a man of religious conviction and had great compassion for his fellow men he died of his war wounds a few months after the war on his farm in waukegan james h howard is the historical figure from illinois i admire the most my middle name is howard to carry on the family name i believe my great great grandfather would be proud of me for sacrificing my career and comfortable life for this campaign to make illinois and the united states healthier more secure and more prosperous what s your favorite tv streaming or web based show of all time why it s hard to pick just one show so my favorites are the tonight show starring johnny carson family ties and firing line with james buckley jr the tonight show starring johnny carson and family ties always provided good humor and family time while firing line was intellectual but highly entertaining frankly i don t watch much television but i enjoy the history and food channels

when lenders such as the international monetary fund or the european stability mechanism want to assess whether a country meets the criteria for receiving international assistance they carry out a debt sustainability analysis dsa this involves debt simulations and scenarios that evaluate the likelihood of countries meeting their future obligations the greek debt crisis however exposed the drawbacks of traditional debt sustainability analysis during crisis episodes uncertainty is high and therefore focusing on average dynamics or on a few scenarios can conceal potential risks dsa applies to crisis countries only but an early warning system identifying vulnerabilities is relevant for all countries a more general less stringent debt vulnerabilities analysis dva could be used to assess countries debt management policies and identify vulnerabilities without leading immediately to policy consequences dva would not carry the significant connotations of dsa for instance it could be used to spot when a country has debt that is non decreasing from very high levels even though that country might pass the dsa test the dutch state treasury agency evaluates its public debt management practices every three years even though its debt to gdp ratio is only 50 the agency carries out a comprehensive analysis prior to a political review including an evaluation of vulnerabilities and the implications for policy are transmitted to the dutch parliament by the finance minister the 2019 evaluation is available here such broader analysis could in particular account for political risks that are currently used to guide expert judgment by the institutions but are not part of dsa the imf makes references to political risks and policy uncertainty in its article iv consultation reports while the european stability mechanism uses governance and or political risk ratings in its sovereign vulnerabilities index and the european central bank uses such ratings to generate a heat map classifying countries in the bottom ratings tercile as red those in the top tercile as green and those in the middle as yellow such broad brush treatment of political risks is useful but unlikely to be effective political instability and economic policy uncertainty can be key determinants of sovereign debt dynamics but are not captured adequately with quantitative rigour by traditional dsas when the imf the ecb or the esm carry out dsas they take into account risk factors including the country s fiscal consolidation path gdp growth and financial assumptions relating to the sovereign bond yields they also consider debt aging costs macro bank stress tests inflation shocks structural shocks contingent liabilities and privatisation receipts we argue that political risk factors can also be quantified and should be part of debt analysis our suggestion becomes attractive because the systematic quantification of political risks has been receiving increasing attention driven in part by the compilation of databases that facilitate cross sectional studies such databases include the ifo world economic survey wes 25 years of semi annual data for 66 countries the world bank 25 years of annual data for 214 countries the icrg index 40 years of annual data for up to 140 countries and the dallas fed s economic policy uncertainty index 25 years of monthly data for 21 countries impetus has also been created by theoretical models and empirical evidence that the markets price political risks building on these advances political risks can be incorporated in dsa and dva and can materially affect the conclusions we first identified see gala et al 2018 two key quantifiable aspects of political risk and second distinguished between short term ambiguity about the political factors that cannot be measured and long term risks that are modelled probabilistically third we used a combination of narrative scenarios about the short term ambiguity and calibrated probabilistic scenarios for long term risks see zenios et al 2019 to obtain a comprehensive heatmap of high risk debt dynamics as an example of what happens when political risks are included we looked at recent developments in italy see below short term political ambiguity and long term uncertainty to incorporate political risks in dsa we were faced with the problem of uncertainty specification which has been daunting economists for a very long time see for example knight 1921 and arrow 1951 we needed to account for short term ambiguity ie which government wins the election what policies will they implement will a country be able to follow an adjustment programme and for the long term volatility on the path towards a well estimated expected future state if we think that such an equilibrium state exists in general it is not possible to estimate reliably an election outcome or what policies a new government will pursue we adopted narrative scenarios for variables with ambiguous immediate outcomes to see what the bad outcomes might be and calibrated probabilistic scenarios for long run uncertainty to estimate appropriate risk metrics we ran the dsa model for a range of plausible values for the critical variables that are affected by political events such as government surplus and country gdp growth for the long run risks we calibrated scenarios of economic fiscal and financial variables accounting for political effects using this approach we identified values for ambiguous variables with high probability of bad outcomes so that they can be avoided the result was a comprehensive heatmap of high risk debt dynamics with quantile optimisation for those aspects of the problem that are amenable to scenario calibration and identification of narrative scenarios with bad outcomes that must be avoided for the ambiguous aspects italy as a case study we applied our model to the 2019 budget agreement between the italian government and the european commission we assessed whether italy can stay on a non increasing debt path with gross financing needs below an imf specified threshold of 20 of gdp and demonstrated the material effects of political risks note our assessment criteria are less stringent than those of official dsas we started with a scenario tree covering gdp growth the primary balance and the risk free rate of euro area five year aaa rated sovereigns but without political variables the scenario tree was calibrated to italy s conditions and observed market data using historical volatilities and correlations to the scenarios of risk free rates the model added premia capturing the response of borrowing rates to debt levels a significant short term political risk was the fiscal stance of the new italian government after the 2018 elections we parametrically changed growth and primary balance projections to cover plausible outcomes and evaluated using the calibrated long term scenario trees the likelihood of debt stocks and gross financing needs staying within the thresholds the result was a heatmap that shows the likelihood of debt dynamics remaining within the thresholds for a wide range of the ambiguous variables we used the model to draw the heatmap and assess italian debt dynamics under three scenarios i no policy change ii the new italian government achieves its growth and surplus projections and iii italy reaches the targets in the agreement negotiated with the european commission we assessed if the outcomes of each scenario would violate the thresholds and therefore must be avoided figure 1 shows the heat map with dark green denoting an extremely low probability 0 01 of unsustainable dynamics and red denoting a very high probability 0 85 note that for a wide range of combinations of gdp growth and primary balance the dynamics are unsustainable with very high probability italy is clearly vulnerable the map also locates our narrative scenarios imf denotes projections from the imf world economic outlook report for 2018 under our model calibration and without any change in policy the debt dynamics are highly likely to be unsustainable pre agreement corresponds to the italian government targets before the budget agreement with the european commission it improves on the previous policy but is still in the red zone post agreement presents further improvements shifting italy into the yellow zone with a probability of 0 55 for sustainable dynamics the wisdom of a policy with a 0 55 chance of achieving its objectives is questionable and additional fiscal effort would be needed to increase to 0 85 the probability of remaining within the thresholds green using the model we estimate that with a total fiscal effort of 3 5 of gdp over twelve years capped at 0 3 per annum italy can reach this target this finding is in agreement with sapir 2018 that italy should have been running a higher primary surplus consistently to avoid finding itself in its current predicament although our estimates for the extra effort are lower figure 1 probability of italian debt violating thresholds on debt stock or gross financing needs source authors calculations using the model of zenios et al 2019 we then incorporated long term political risks we generated a new scenario tree with political stability and economic policy confidence state variables calibrated to italy s volatile political variables around estimated long term trends to calibrate the political state variables we assumed that they converge long term to their historical averages of 4 5 out of 10 for stability and 15 5 out of 100 for policy we also estimate volatilities from the historical ratings for italy namely a standard deviation of 1 for stability and 11 for economic policy confidence the political variables are correlated with growth primary balance and interest rates with historical correlations from 0 44 to 0 75 respectively regression estimates of the bond yield sensitivities to these factors are then added to the refinancing costs scenarios adjusted according to the endogenous debt risk premium we re ran the model including political risk premia and redrew the heatmap figure 2 figure 2 probability of italian debt violating thresholds on stock or gross financing taking political risks into account source authors calculations using the model of zenios et al 2019 from this a marked increase in the area that denotes a high probability of unsustainable dynamics can be seen with political vulnerabilities taken into account more combinations of growth and primary surplus are highly likely to violate the thresholds under our model the agreement with the european commission which was estimated to have a slightly better than 0 50 chance of success would only have a 0 15 chance of success when political risks are accounted for the additional fiscal effort that restores sustainability with a probability of 0 85 is now borderline light green with a 0 65 to 0 55 chance of success clearly

claudio cabrera mintpress news behind the curtain a different narrative for iraq us tensions andrew caballero reynolds reuters indeed the demonstrations started whereby a third party would target both the demonstrators and security forces and kill them trump called me immediately and physically threatened myself and the defense minister in the event that there was more talk about this third party reports of a third side firing on iraqi protesters were picked up by major media outlets at the time reports say the security forces opened fire but another account says unknown gunmen were responsible a source in karbala told the bbc that one of the dead was a guard at a nearby shia shrine who happened to be passing by the source also said the origin of the gunfire was unknown and it had targeted both the protesters and security forces emphasis added the deal that was signed between iraq and china would see around 20 percen t of iraq s oil revenue go to china in exchange for reconstruction the iraq china oil deal a prelude to something more lintao zhang ap the u s government threatened to cut off iraq s access to its central bank account currently held at the federal reserve bank of new york the petrodollar and the phantom of the petroyuan over the last three years under my leadership our economy is stronger than ever before and america has achieved energy independence these historic accomplishments changed our strategic priorities these are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible and options in the middle east became available we are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world we are independent and we do not need middle east oil it still very much needs to continue to dominate how oil is traded and sold on international markets in order to maintain its status as both a global military and financial superpower karim kadim ap the takeaway from the petrodollar phenomenon is that as long as countries need oil they will need the dollar as long as countries demand dollars the u s can continue to go into massive amounts of debt to fund its network of global military bases wall street bailouts nuclear missiles and tax cuts for the rich the new strategy is to enlist the energy markets help beijing may introduce a new way to price oil in coming months but unlike the contracts based on the u s dollar that currently dominate global markets this benchmark would use china s own currency if there s widespread adoption as the chinese hope then that will mark a step toward challenging the greenback s status as the world s most powerful currency the plan is to price oil in yuan using a gold backed futures contract in shanghai but the road will be long and arduous about the author whitney webb is a mintpress news journalist based in chile she has contributed to several independent media outlets including global research ecowatch the ron paul institute and 21st century wire among others she has made several radio and television appearances and is the 2019 winner of the serena shim award for uncompromised integrity in journalism since the u s killed iranian general qassem soleimani and iraqi militia leader abu mahdi al muhandis earlier this month the official narrative has held that their deaths were necessary to prevent a vague yet allegedly imminent threat of violence towards americans though president trump has since claimed whether or not soleimani or his iraqi allies posed an imminent threat doesn t really matter while the situation between iran iraq and the u s appears to have de escalated substantially at least for now it is worth revisiting the lead up to the recent u s iraq iran tensions up to the trump mandated killing of soleimani and abu mahdi al muhandis in order to understand indeed it has been alleged that even the timing of soleimani s assassination was directly related to his diplomatic role in iraq and his push to help iraq secure its oil independence beginning with the implementation of a new massive oil deal with china while recent rhetoric in the media has dwelled on the extent of iran s influence in iraq china s recent dealings with iraq particularly in its oil sector are to blame for much of what has transpired in iraq in recent months at least according to iraq s prime minister adel abdul mahdi who is currently serving in a caretaker role much of the u s pressure exerted on iraq s government with respect to china has reportedly taken place covertly and behind closed doors keeping the trump administration s concerns over china s growing ties to iraq largely out of public view perhaps over concerns that a public scuffle could exacerbate the u s china trade war and endanger efforts to resolve it yet whatever the reasons may be evidence strongly suggests that the u s is equally concerned about china s presence in iraq as it is with iran s this is becauseiraq s caretaker prime minister adel abdul mahdi gave a series of remarks on january 5 during a parliamentary session that received surprisingly little media attention during that session only part of abdul mahdi s statements were broadcast on television after al halbousi oddly attended the parliamentary session even though it was boycotted by his allied sunni and kurdish representatives after the feed was cut mps who were present wrote down abdul mahdi s remarks which were then given to the arabic news outlet ida at per that transcript abdul mahdi stated that abdul mahdi continued his remarks noting that pressure from the trump administration over his negotiations and subsequent dealings with china grew substantially over time even resulting in death threats to himself and his defense minister after my return from china trump called me and asked me to cancel the agreement so i also refused and i did not respond and submitted my resignation and the americans still insist to this day on canceling the china agreement very few english language outlets reported on abdul mahdi s comments tom luongo a florida based independent analyst and publisher of the gold goats n guns newsletter told mintpress that the likely reasons for the surprising media silence over abdul mahdi s claims were because it never really made it out into official channels due to the cutting of the video feed during iraq s parliamentary session and due to the fact that it s very inconvenient and the media since trump is doing what they want him to do be belligerent with iran protected israel s interests there they aren t going to contradict him on that if he s playing ball luongo added before continuing that the media would nonetheless hold onto it for future reference if this comes out for real they ll use it against him later if he tries to leave iraq everything in washington is used as leverage he added given the lack of media coverage and the cutting of the video feed of abdul mahdi s full remarks it is worth pointing out thatfor instance such as in this bbc report which stated after six weeks of intense protests abdul mahdi submitted his resignation on november 29 just a few days after iraq s foreign minister praised the new deals including the oil for reconstruction deal that had been signed with china abdul mahdi has since stayed on as prime minister in a caretaker role until parliament decides on his replacement abdul mahdi s claims of the covert pressure by the trump administration are buttressed by the use of similar tactics against ecuador where in july 2018 the new york times reported at the time that the u s delegation was seeking to promote the interests of infant formula manufacturers regarding abdul mahdi s claims luongo told mintpress that it is also worth considering that what i won t say directly is that i don t know it was trump at the other end of the phone calls mahdi it is to his best advantage politically to blame everything on trump it could have been mike pompeo or gina haspel talking to abdul mahdi it could have been anyone it most likely would be someone with plausible deniability this sounds credible i firmly believe trump is capable of making these threats but i don t think trump would make those threats directly like that but luongo also argued that the current tensions between u s and iraqi leadership preceded the oil deal between iraq and china by several weeks all of this starts with prime minister mahdi starting the process of opening up the iraq syria border crossing and that was announced in august then the israeli air attacks happened in september to try and stop that from happening attacks on pmu forces on the border crossing along with the ammo dump attacks near baghdad this drew the iraqis ire mahdi then tried to close the air space over iraq but how much of that he can enforce is a big question as to why it would be to mahdi s advantage to blame trump luongo stated that mahdi can make edicts all day long but in reality how much can he actually restrain the u s or the israelis from doing anything except for shame diplomatic shame to me it seems perfectly credible because during all of this trump or probably someone else is shaking him down for the reconstruction of the oil fields trump has explicitly stated we want the oil as luongo noted trump s interest in the u s obtaining a significant share of iraqi oil revenue is hardly a secret just last march trump asked abdul mahdi how about the oil at the end of a meeting at the white house prompting abdul mahdi to ask what do you mean to which trump responded well we did a lot we did a lot over there we spent trillions over there and a lot of people have been talking about the oil which was widely interpreted aswith abdul mahdi having rejected trump s oil for reconstruction proposal in favor of china s it seems likely that the trump administration would default to so called gangster diplomacy tactics to pressure iraq s government into accepting trump s deal especially given the fact that china s deal was a much better offer according to abdul mahdi aside from the potential loss in iraq s oil revenue there are many reasons for the trump administration to feel threatened by china s recent dealings in iraq when abdul mahdi s delegation traveled to beijing last september the oil for reconstruction deal was only one of eight total agreements that were established these agreements cover a range of areas including financial commercial security reconstruction communication culture education and foreign affairs in addition to oil yet the oil deal is by far the most significant per the agreement chinese firms will work on various reconstruction projects in exchange for roughly 20 percent of iraq s oil exports approximately 100 000 barrels per day for a period of 20 years according to al monitor abdul mahdi had the following to say about the deal we agreed to set up a joint investment fund which the oil money will finance adding thatthe agreement is similar to one negotiated between iraq and china in 2015 when abdul mahdi was serving as iraq s oil minister that year iraq joined china s belt and road initiative in a deal that also involved exchanging oil for investment development and construction projects and saw china awarded several projects as a result in a notable similarity to recent events that deal was put on hold due to political and security tensions caused by unrest and the surge of isis in iraq that is until abdul mahdi saw iraq rejoin the initiative again late last year through the agreements his government signed with china last september notably after recent tensions between the u s and iraq over the assassination of soleimani and the u s subsequent refusal to remove its troops from iraq despite its parliament s demands given abdul mahdi s recent claims about the true forces behind iraq s recent protests and trump s threats against him being directly related to his dealings with china the move appears to be a not so veiled signal from abdul mahdi to washington that he plans to deepen iraq s partnership with china at least for as long as he remains in his caretaker role iraq s decision to dramatically increase its oil exports to china the account was set up after the u s invaded and began occupying iraq in 2003 and iraq currently removes between 1 2 billion per month to cover essential government expenses according to iraqi government officials who spoke to afp though trump publicly promised to rebuke iraq for the expulsion of u s troops via sanctions the threat to cut off iraq s access to its account at the ny federal reserve bank was delivered privately and directly to the prime minister adding further credibility to abdul mahdi s claims that trump s most aggressive attempts at pressuring iraq s government are made in private and directed towards the country s prime minister though trump s push this time was about preventing the expulsion of u s troops from iraq his reasons for doing so may also be related to concerns about china s growing foothold in the region indeed while trump has now lost his desired share of iraqi oil revenue 50 percent to china s counter offer of 20 percent the removal of u s troops from iraq may see american troops replaced with their chinese counterparts as well according to tom luongo all of this is about the u s maintaining the fiction that it needs to stay in iraq so china moving in there is the moment where they get their toe hold for the belt and road luongo argued that helps to strengthen the economic relationship between iraq iran and china and obviates the need for the americans to stay there at some point china will have assets on the ground that they are going to want to defend militarily in the event of any major crisis this brings us to the next thing we know that mahdi and the chinese ambassador discussed that very thing in the wake of the soleimani killing indeed according to news reports zhang yao china s ambassador to iraq conveyed beijing s readiness to provide military assistance should iraq s government request it soon after soleimani s assassination yao made the offer a day after iraq s parliament voted to expel american troops from the country though it is currently unknown how abdul mahdi responded to the offer the timing likely caused no shortage of concern among the trump administration about its rapidly waning influence in iraq you can see what s coming here luongo told mintpress of the recent chinese offer to iraq russia is also playing a role in the current scenario aslast september the same month that iraq signed eight deals including the oil deal with china then in the wake of soleimani s death russia again offered the air defense systems to iraq to allow them to better defend their air space in the past the u s has threatened allied countries with sanctions and other measures if they purchase russian air defense systems as opposed to those manufactured by u s companies the u s efforts to curb china s growing influence and presence in iraq amid these new strategic partnerships and agreements are limited however as the u s is increasingly relying on china as part of its iran policy specifically in its goal of reducing iranian oil export to zero china remains iran s main crude oil and condensate importer even after it reduced its imports of iranian oil significantly following u s pressure last year yet the u s is now attempting to pressure china to stop buying iranian oil completely or face sanctions while also attempting to privately sabotage the china iraq oil deal it is highly unlikely china will concede to the u s on both if any of those fronts meaning the u s may be forced to choose which policy front iran containment vs iraq s oil dealings with china it values more in the coming weeks and months furthermore the recent signing of the phase one trade deal with china revealed another potential facet of the u s increasingly complicated relationship with iraq s oil sector given that the trade deal involves selling u s oil and gas to china at very low cost suggesting thatin his televised statements last week following iran s military response to the u s assassination of general soleimani trump insisted that the u s middle east policy is no longer being directed by america s vast oil requirements he stated specifically that yet given the centrality of the iraq china oil deal in guiding some of the trump administration s recent middle east policy moves this appears not to be the case the distinction may lie in the fact that while the u s may now be less dependent on oil imports from the middle east indeed even if the u s is importing less middle eastern oil the petrodollar system first forged in the 1970s requires that the u s maintains enough control over the global oil trade so that the world s largest oil exporters iraq among them continue to sell their oil in dollars as kei pritsker and cale holmes noted in an article last year for mintpress thus the use of the petrodollar has created a system whereby u s control of oil sales of the largest oil exporters is necessary not just to buttress the dollar but also to support its global military presence therefore notably one of the architects of the petrodollar system and the man who infamously described u s soldiers as dumb stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy former secretary of state henry kissinger has been advising trump and informing his china policy since 2016 this take was also expressed by economist michael hudson who recently noted that u s access to oil dollarization and u s military strategy are intricately interwoven and that trump s recent iraq policy is intended to escalate america s presence in iraq to keep control of the region s oil reserves and as hudson says to back saudi arabia s wahabi troops isis al qaeda in iraq al nusra and other divisions of what are actually america s foreign legion to support u s control of near eastern oil as a buttress of the u s dollar hudson further asserts that it was qassem soleimani s efforts to promote iraq s oil independence at the expense of u s imperial ambitions that served one of the key motives behind his assassination america opposed general soleimani above all because he was fighting against isis and other u s backed terrorists in their attempt to break up syria and replace assad s regime with a set of u s compliant local leaders the old british divide and conquer ploy on occasion soleimani had cooperated with u s troops in fighting isis groups that got out of line meaning the u s party line butthat president trump has bragged so loudly about grabbing emphasis added hudson adds that u s neocons feared soleimani s plan to help iraq assert control of its oil and withstand the terrorist attacks supported by u s and saudi s on iraq that is what made his assassination an immediate drive while other factors such as pressure from u s allies like israel also played a factor in the decision to kill soleimani the decision to assassinate him on iraqi soil just hours before he was set to meet with abdul mahdi in a diplomatic role suggests that the underlying tensions caused by iraq s push for oil independence and its oil deal with china did play a factor in the timing of his assassination it also served as a threat to abdul mahdi who has claimed that the u s threatened to kill both him and his defense minister just weeks prior over tensions directly related to the push for independence of iraq s oil sector from the u s it appears that the ever present role of the petrodollar in guiding u s policy in the middle east remains unchanged beyond current efforts to stave off iraq s oil independence and keep its oil trade aligned with the u s the fact that the u s is now seeking to limit china s ever growing role in iraq s oil sector is also directly related to china s publicly known efforts tosince 2017 china has made its plans for the petroyuan a direct competitor to the petrodollar no secret particularly after china eclipsed the u s as as cnbc noted at the time if the u s continues on its current path and pushes iraq further into the arms of china and other u s rival states it goes without saying that iraq now a part of china s belt and road initiative may soon favor a petroyuan system over a petrodollar system particularly as the current u s administration threatens to hold iraq s central bank account hostage for pursuing policies washington finds unfavorable it could also explain why president trump is so concerned about china s growing

imperial valley news center president trump at the world economic forum davos switzerland president trump at the world economic forum president trump well thank you very much klaus and a very special congratulations on your 50th year hosting the annual meeting of the world economic forum a truly amazing achievement it s an honor to address the distinguished members of this organization for the second time as president when i spoke at this forum two years ago i told you that we had launched the great american comeback today i m proud to declare that the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before we ve regained our stride we discovered our spirit and reawakened the powerful machinery of american enterprise america is thriving america is flourishing and yes america is winning again like never before just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made they just happened to get done in the same week these agreements represent a new model of trade for the 21st century agreements that are fair reciprocal and that prioritize the needs of workers and families america s economic turnaround has been nothing short of spectacular when i took office three years ago america s economy was in a rather dismal state under the previous administration nearly 200 000 manufacturing jobs had vanished wages were flat or falling almost 5 million more americans had left the labor force than had gotten jobs and more than 10 million people had been added to the food stamp rolls the experts predicted a decade of very very slow growth or even maybe negative growth high unemployment and a dwindling workforce and very much a shrinking middle class millions of hardworking ordinary citizens felt neglected betrayed forgotten they were rapidly losing faith in the system before my presidency began the outlook for many nations was bleak top economists warned of a protracted worldwide recession the world bank lowered its projections for global growth to a number that nobody wanted to even think about pessimism had taken root deep in the minds of leading thinkers business leaders and policymakers yet despite all of the cynics i had never been more confident in america s future i knew we were on the verge of a profound economic resurgence if we did things right one that would generate a historic wave of investment wage growth and job creation i knew that if we unleashed the potential of our people if we cut taxes slashed regulations and we did that at a level that s never been done before in the history of our country in a short period of time fixed broken trade deals and fully tapped american energy that prosperity would come thundering back at a record speed and that is exactly what we did and that is exactly what happened since my election america has gained over 7 million jobs a number unthinkable i wouldn t say it i wouldn t talk about it but that was a number that i had in mind the projection was 2 million we did 7 more than three times the government s own projections the unemployment rate is now less than 3 4 and 5 percent and at 3 5 percent that s a number that is the lowest in more than 50 years the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with reasonably high rate for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we re concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy ever to exist we are lifting up americans of every race color religion and creed unemployment rates among african americans hispanic americans and asian americans have all reached record lows african american youth unemployment has reached the lowest it s ever been in the history of our country african american poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level since 1953 and women now comprise a majority of the american workforce that s for the first time the unemployment rate for veterans has dropped to a record low the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all time record low workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in u s history wages are rising across the board and those at the bottom of the income ladder are enjoying the percentage by far largest gains workers wages are now growing faster than management wages earnings growth for the bottom 10 percent is outpacing the top 10 percent something that has not happened paychecks for high school graduates are rising faster than for college graduates young americans just entering the workforce are also sharing in america s extraordinary prosperity since i took office more than 2 million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5 percent annually a number that was unthinkable nobody would have ever thought it was possible three years ago a record number of americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working in the eight years before i took office over 300 000 working age people left the workforce in just three years in my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce ten million people have been lifted off welfare in less than three years celebrating the dignity of work is a fundamental pillar of our agenda this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 percent three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded the american dream is back bigger better and stronger than ever before no one is benefitting more than america s middle class we have created 1 2 million manufacturing and construction jobs a number also unthinkable after losing 60 000 factories under the previous two administrations hard to believe when you hear 60 000 factories america has now gained in a very short period of time 12 000 new factories under my administration and the number is going up rapidly we ll be beating the 60 000 number that we lost except these will be bigger newer and the latest years of economic stagnation have given way to a roaring geyser of opportunity u s stock markets have soared by more than 50 percent since my election adding more than 19 trillion to household wealth and boosting 401 k s pensions and college savings accounts for millions of hardworking families and these great numbers are many things and it s despite the fact that the fed has raised rates too fast and lowered them too slowly and even now as the united states is by far the strongest economic power in the world it s not even close it was going to be close but a lot of good things happened to us and some not so good things happened to certain other places they re forced to compete and we compete with nations that are getting negative rates something very new meaning they get paid to borrow money something that i could get used to very quickly love that got to pay back your loan oh how much am i getting nevertheless we still have the best numbers that we ve had in so many different areas it s a conservative approach and we have a tremendous upside potential when all of the trade deals and the massive deregulation starts kicking in which will be during this year especially toward the end of the year those trade deals are starting to kick in already the regulations are kicking in right now and i see such tremendous potential for the future we have not even started because the numbers we re talking about are massive the time for skepticism is over people are flowing back into our country companies are coming back into our country many of you who i know are coming back in with your plants and your factories thank you very much america s newfound prosperity is undeniable unprecedented and unmatched anywhere in the world america achieved this stunning turnaround not by making minor changes to a handful of policies but by adopting a whole new approach centered entirely on the wellbeing of the american worker every decision we make on taxes trade regulation energy immigration education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday americans we are determined to create the highest standard of living that anyone can imagine and right now that s what we re doing for our workers the highest in the world and we re determined to ensure that the working and middle class reap the largest gains a nation s highest duty is to its own citizens honoring this truth is the only way to build faith and confidence in the market system only when governments put their own citizens first will people be fully invested in their national futures in the united states we are building an economy that works for everyone restoring the bonds of love and loyalty that unite citizens and powers nations today i hold up the american model as an example to the world of a working system of free enterprise that will produce the most benefits for the most people in the 21st century and beyond a pro worker pro citizen pro family agenda demonstrates how a nation can thrive when its communities its companies its government and its people work together for the good of the whole nation as part of this new vision we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in american history we doubled the child tax credit benefitting 40 million american families and lifting 650 000 single mothers and their 1 million children out of poverty and out of poverty quickly we passed the first ever tax credit for employers who provide paid paternal leave for employees earning 72 000 less annually and passed paid family leave for government employees as a model for the country we made childcare much more affordable and reduced or eliminated childcare waitlists all across the nation our childcare reforms are supporting working parents and ensuring their children have access to high quality care and education all of which they very much deserve we lowered our business tax from the highest in the developed world down to one that s not only competitive but one of the lower taxes we created nearly 9 000 opportunity zones in distressed communities where capital gains on long term investments are now taxed at zero and tremendous wealth is pouring into areas that for a hundred years saw nothing the 35 million americans who live in these areas have already seen their home values rise by more than 22 billion my administration has also made historic investments in historically black colleges and universities i saved hcbus we saved them they were going out and we saved them we re removing roadblocks to success and rewarding businesses that invest in workers families and communities we ve also launched the most ambitious campaign in history to reduce job killing regulations for every new regulation adopted we are removing eight old regulations which will save an average of american households about 3 100 per year it was going to be for every one we do two but we were able to lift that to eight and we think that s going to go quite a bit higher we still have a way to go today i urge other nations to follow our example and liberate your citizens from the crushing weight of bureaucracy with that you have to run your own countries the way you want we re also restoring the constitutional rule of law in america which is essential to our economy our liberty and our future and that s why we ve appointed over 190 federal judges a record to interpret the law as written one hundred and ninety federal judges think of that and two supreme court judges as a result of our efforts investment is pouring into our country in the first half of 2019 the united states attracted nearly one quarter of all foreign direct investment in the world think of that twenty five percent of all foreign investment all over the world came into the united states and that number is increasing rapidly to every business looking for a place where they are free to invest build thrive innovate and succeed there is no better place on earth than the united states as a central part of our commitment to building an inclusive society we established the national council for the american worker we want every citizen regardless of age or background to have the cutting edge skills to compete and succeed in tomorrow s workplace this includes critical industries like artificial intelligence quantum computing and 5g under ivanka s leadership who is with us today our pledge to america s workers has become a full blown national movement with over 400 companies committing to provide new job and training opportunities to already very close to 15 million american students and workers fifteen million america is making sweeping changes to place workers and their families at the center of our national agenda perhaps the most transformative change of all is on trade reform where we re addressing chronic problems that have been ignored tolerated or enabled for decades our leaders did nothing about what happened to us on trade before i was elected china s predatory practices were undermining trade for everyone but no one did anything about it except allow it to keep getting worse and worse and worse under my leadership america confronted the problem head on under our new phase one agreement phase two is starting negotiations very shortly china has agreed to substantially do things that they would not have done measures to protect intellectual property stop forced technology transfers remove trade barriers in agricultural goods and on agricultural goods where we were treated so badly open its financial sector totally that s done and maintain a stable currency all backed by very very strong enforcement our relationship with china right now has probably never been better we went through a very rough patch but it s never ever been better my relationship with president xi is an extraordinary one he s for china i m for the u s but other than that we love each other additionally china will spend an additional 200 billion over two years on american services agriculture and energy and manufactured goods so we ll be taking in an excess of 200 billion could be closer to 300 billion when it finishes but these achievements would not have been possible without the implementation of tariffs which we had to use and we re using them on others too and that is why most of our tariffs on china will remain in place during the phase two negotiations for the most part the tariffs have been left and we re being paid billions and billions of dollars a year as a country as i mentioned earlier we ended the nafta disaster one of the worst trade deals ever made not even close and replaced it with the incredible new trade deal the usmca that s mexico and canada in the nearly 25 years after nafta the united states lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs including nearly 1 in 4 vehicle manufacturing jobs it was an incentive to leave the country the nafta agreement exemplified the decades long failures of the international trading system the agreement shifted wealth to the hands of a few promoted massive outsourcing drove down wages and shuttered plants and factories by the thousands the plants would leave our country make the product sell it into our country we ended up with no jobs and no taxes would buy other countries product that doesn t happen anymore this is the wreckage that i was elected to clean up it s probably the reason i ran for president more than any other thing because i couldn t understand why we were losing all of these jobs to other countries at such a rapid rate and it got worse and worse and i think it s probably the primary reason that i ran but there are other reasons also and to replace with a new system that puts workers before the special interests and the special interests will do just fine but the workers come first our brand new usmca is the result of the broadest coalition ever assembled for a trade agreement manufacturing agriculture and labor all strongly endorsed the deal and as you know it just passed in congress overwhelmingly it shows how to solve the 21st century challenge we all face protecting intellectual property expanding digital trade re shoring lost jobs and ensuring rising wages and living standards the united states has also concluded a great new trade deal with japan approximately 40 billion and completely renegotiated our deal with south korea we re also negotiating many other transactions with many other countries and we look forward to negotiating a tremendous new deal with the united kingdom they have a wonderful new prime minister and wants very much to make a deal as they say to protect our security and our economy we are also boldly embracing american energy independence the united states is now by far the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far it s not even close while many european countries struggle with crippling energy costs the american energy revolution is saving american families 2 500 every year in lowering electric bills and numbers that people said couldn t happen and also very importantly prices at the pump we ve been so successful that the united states no longer needs to import energy from hostile nations with an abundance of american natural gas now available our european allies no longer have to be vulnerable to unfriendly energy suppliers either we urge our friends in europe to use america s vast supply and achieve true energy security with u s companies and researchers leading the way we are on the threshold of virtually unlimited reserves of energy including from traditional fuels lng clean coal next generation nuclear power and gas hydrate technologies at the same time i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years we re committed to conserving the majesty of god s creation and the natural beauty of our world today i m pleased to announce the united states will join one trillion trees initiative being launched here at the world economic forum one trillion trees applause and in doing so we will continue to show strong leadership in restoring growing and better managing our trees and our forests this is not a time for pessimism this is a time for optimism fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action but to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse they are the heirs of yesterday s foolish fortune tellers and i have them and you have them and we all have them and they want to see us do badly but we don t let that happen they predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s mass starvation in the 70s and an end of oil in the 1990s these alarmists always demand the same thing absolute power to dominate transform and control every aspect of our lives we will never let radical socialists destroy our economy wreck our country or eradicate our liberty america will always be the proud strong and unyielding bastion of freedom in america we understand what the pessimists refuse to see that a growing and vibrant market economy focused on the future lifts the human spirit and excites creativity strong enough to overcome any challenge any challenge by far the great scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century from penicillin to high yield wheat to modern transportation and breakthrough vaccines have lifted living standards and saved billions of lives around the world and we re continuing to work on things that you ll be hearing about in the near future that even today sitting here right now you wouldn t believe it s possible that we have found the answers you ll be hearing about it but we have found answers to things that people said would not be possible certainly not in a very short period of time but the wonders of the last century will pale in comparison to what today s young innovators will achieve because they are doing things that nobody thought even feasible to begin we continue to embrace technology not to shun it when people are free to innovate millions will live longer happier healthier lives for three years now america has shown the world that the path to a prosperous future begins with putting workers first choosing growth and freeing entrepreneurs to bring their dreams to life for anyone who doubts what is possible in the future we need only look at the towering achievements of the past only a few hundred miles from here are some of the great cities of europe teeming centers of commerce and culture each of them is full of reminders of what human drive and imagination can achieve centuries ago at the time of the renaissance skilled craftsmen and laborers looked upwards and built the structures that still touch the human heart to this day some of the greatest structures in the world have been built hundreds of years ago in italy the citizens once started construction on what would be a 140 year project the duomo of florence an incredible incredible place while the technology did not yet exist to complete their design city fathers forged ahead anyway certain that they would figure it out someday these citizens of florence did not accept limits to their high aspirations and so the great dome was finally built in france another century long project continues to hold such a grip on our hearts and our souls that even 800 years after its construction when the cathedral of notre dame was engulfed in flames last year such a sad sight to watch unbelievable site especially for those of us that considered it one of the great great monuments and representing so many different things the whole world grieved though her sanctuary now stands scorched and charred and a sight that s hard to believe when you got used to it to look at it now hard to believe but we know that notre dame will be restored will be restored magnificently the great bells will once again ring out for all to hear giving glory to god and filling millions with wonder and awe the cathedrals of europe teach us to pursue big dreams daring adventures and unbridled ambitions they urge us to consider not only what we build today but what we will endure long after we are gone they testify to the power of ordinary people to realize extraordinary achievements when united by a grand and noble purpose so together we must go forward with confidence determination and vision we must not be timid or meek or fearful but instead we must boldly seize the day and embrace the moment we have so many great leaders in this room not only business leaders but leaders of nations and some are doing such a fantastic job we work together very closely we will draw strength from the glories of the past and we will make greatness our common mission for the future together we will make our nations stronger our countries safer our culture richer our people freer and the world more beautiful than ever before above all else we will forever be loyal to our workers our citizens and our families the men and women who are the backbone of our economies the heart of our communities and the soul of our countries let us bring light to their lives one by one and empower them to light up the world thank you very much god bless you god bless your countries and god bless america thank you thank you very much
warns imf after its latest checkup the current vulnerable state of the banking sector steeped in default loans poses the biggest danger to sustenance of bangladesh s tremendous growth momentum said the international monetary fund bangladesh logged in 8 15 per cent gdp growth last fiscal year after three consecutive years of more than 7 per cent expansion and is on track to surpassing the number this year the recent strong economic growth can continue only with a sound financial system that effectively allocates savings to more productive uses said the washington based multilateral lender in a report after its specialist team visited bangladesh last month as per latest central bank data which is of september last year default loans in the banking sector stood at tk tk 116 288 crore which is an all time high eight state run banks accounted for more than 50 percent of the default loans tk 59 622 crore high and increasing default loans and weak governance in the banking sector especially in state owned banks remain major policy challenges said the report which was handed in to the finance ministry and the bangladesh bank to address them the main priorities are a strict enforcement of existing legal and regulatory requirements an increase banking sector capital and a reform of the state owned banks with a clear separation of commercial and development functions the imf mission though welcomed ongoing efforts to strengthen the legal system to address banking sector weakness which should be completed in a timely manner the mission is sceptical about the success of the central bank s most recent loan rescheduling package it allowed defaulters to reschedule loans by providing 2 per cent down payment the move will lower the default ratio initially however without additional measures there are significant risks that the rescheduled loans will become defaults again it said the imf mission is also opposed to the idea of forming a public asset management company to take over banks toxic loans from them a draft act on this has already been formed considering the current regulatory and legal environment establishment of an asset management company poses significant fiscal risks the report also expressed reservations about the increase in government borrowing from the banking sector brought on by the sharp decline in savings certificate sales and slowdown in revenue growth while the increase in the deficit during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 20 was broadly matched by an increase in bank deposits the simultaneous reduction in savings certificate issuance added to the demand on bank funding subsequently private sector credit growth slowed down in november last year private sector credit growth dropped to 9 87 per cent which is the lowest since 2008 at least the bb s data goes as far back as 2008 while the imf welcomed the decline in savings certificate sales it called for stepped up efforts for a smoother transition to lower instrument issuance if the government s revenue deficit continues to widen without a sustained increase in deposit growth crowding out of private investment would increase with a possible adverse impact on growth improving revenue collection through a coordinated approach to expand the tax base and modernise tax administration remains a priority the report said collections grew just 4 83 per cent in the first four months of the fiscal year down from 6 74 per cent registered a year earlier this resulted in a significant widening of the fiscal deficit according to the imf specialist team subsequently they called for automation and introduction of electronic fiscal devices at the earliest as well as simpler vat structure with fewer non standard rates and exemptions the steps would help both increase revenue and streamline tax administration given weak revenue collection and likely increases in various subsidies including for liquefied natural gas imports keeping the budget deficit within 5 per cent of gdp while protecting priority social spending and implementing the budgeted investment spending could become challenging the bb should continue to monitor inflation developments closely and stand ready to adjust its stance it said inflation expectations remain elevated it said bangladesh s average inflation crept up four basis points to 5 59 per cent in 2019 which saw fluctuations throughout the year and a skyrocketing of the price of onion an essential cooking ingredient full year inflation averaged 5 7 percent in 2017 and 5 55 percent in 2016 according to data from the bangladesh bureau of statistics the central bank should also continue to increase exchange rate flexibility to help buffer the economy against external shocks the report said export diversification remains another priority for the government the imf mission said recent export contraction in the garment sector shows risks from excessive reliance on this sector for export growth export earnings fell 5 84 per cent year on year to 19 3 billion in the first six months of the fiscal year on the back of lower shipment of apparel items the shipment of apparel which usually makes up more than 80 per cent of national exports fell 6 21 per cent to 16 02 billion according to data from the export promotion bureau within the garment sector moving to a wider variety of higher value added goods and expanding to different markets would help buffer external shocks improving the business environment would help attract foreign direct investment support the creation of new export industries and help nascent industries grow stimulating higher economic growth over the medium term the imf also suggested a heatmap for bangladesh to keep track of monthly economic development for efficient and proactive macroeconomic management heatmaps which are two dimensional visual representations of data using colours where the colours all represent different values enable an efficient and comprehensive overview of a topic at a glance the multilateral lender also plans to help bangladesh offset the social impact of automation preliminary results suggest that occupations most vulnerable to automation judged by the average risk of automation being above 70 per cent account for about 60 per cent of the current labour force the occupations include clerical workers agricultural workers plant and machine operators and other elementary occupations the imf report added an imf team will arrive in march to help the country with the issues

people close to them wazni an economist who has been interviewed by the local press for years is an adviser to house speaker nabih berri a former armed group leader and head of the amal movement which is allied with hezbollah many see berri as a symbol of the old order and the corruption that has pervaded lebanon since the end of its 15 year civil war in 1990 wazni insists he is not a political appointee and that berri chose him because he believes he has the right credentials to steward the country through challenging economic conditions we are a government of 20 people who are experts in the full sense of the word wazni said foreign help needed diab s cabinet notably leaves out roughly half of lebanon s political spectrum in a country where most governments in recent years have included all major parties citing sectarian power sharing considerations many observers have criticised diab for forming a one color cabinet led by hezbollah warning the composition could expose lebanon to increased pressure as well as possible sanctions from the west at a time where the country needs all the foreign help it can get hezbollah has been heavily sanctioned under united states president donald trump last week the united kingdom expanded asset freezing measures to encompass all of hezbollah rather than just its military wing but wazni said preliminary indications from the west are positive pointing to a statement on wednesday by french president emmanuel macron that france would do everything to help lebanon get out of its crisis he said the cabinet would strive to convince the international community of lebanon s commitment to reform because there is a big need for foreign support lebanon has traditionally gained financial support from european powers chiefly france and wealthy gulf arab nations including saudi arabia but ties with the gulf have been strained in recent years over the growing power of hezbollah in lebanon as well as the previous government s failure to undertake the reforms needed to unlock 11bn in soft loans pledged by the international community at a donor conference in paris nearly two years ago deepening crises wazni is taking over lebanon s finance portfolio amid compounding crises in lebanon that have shaken confidence in the country s banking system and pushed it closer to defaulting on its debt lebanon is the third most indebted nation in the world as a percentage of its gross domestic product while dwindling foreign currency reserves threaten its ability to service debt the country s downward financial spiral has deepened further amid unprecedented protests that have rocked lebanon for nearly 100 days banks closed for two weeks at the start of the uprising and have since put in place harsh capital controls on depositors limiting withdrawals to about 200 a week this has caused an outburst of rage against banks dozens of which have been vandalised across the country according to lebanon s internal security forces in a statement on wednesday the association of banks in lebanon released a statement saying it hopes the formation of the new government will have a positive impact on the general conditions in the country paving the way for the return of stability wazni said one of his priorities is to remedy the chaotic scenes at banks in lebanon through policies endorsed by the cabinet he also said it is up to the government as a whole to decide whether lebanon would default on its debt payments or engage in a debt restructuring process he declined to give his personal view on the matter of debt restructuring meanwhile the country s currency the lebanese pound which is officially pegged to the us dollar at 1 507 has depreciated by up to 60 percent in recent weeks to 2 500 lebanese dollars to 1 on a parallel market it appreciated to 2 000 lebanese pounds against the dollar on wednesday after currency exchange dealers capped the buying at that rate in an agreement with the country s central bank wazni said it was very unlikely the parallel rate would return to 1 500 lebanese pounds this shouldn t be a shocking statement there are two markets he said the most important thing is that there is stability in the parallel market and if things get better in the future then the price will go down wazni added that confidence in the currency would have to be restored through work not talk our job is to form a ministerial statement that instills confidence and is serious he said we have to address the situation at banks the exchange rate the state of public finance in lebanon there are so many things that we have to do but there is one thing wazni said he won t do namely impose any new taxes that would compound the financial pain already heaped on low income families the economic situation and the difficult living conditions in the country today do not allow for any new taxes he said
social security hasn t been at the top of the american political agenda for years but bernie sanders is putting it back to take on joe biden sanders s camp heavily previewed the argument that biden has a worrying track record of pushing for social security cuts before the most recent democratic debate but then whiffed leaving biden largely uncriticized as sanders instead got pulled into a dispute with elizabeth warren then over the weekend david sirota a sanders adviser known for his attack dog persona wrote in a campaign email that biden for years has tried to slash social security and medicare all while bernie was working to stop those cuts he included a ream of supporting links including one to a video of a 2018 biden event that sirota said showed biden lauded paul ryan for proposing cuts to social security and medicare biden s campaign pushed back ferociously accusing sanders s allies of circulating a doctored video and demanding an apology sirota s characterization of that specific video is wrong though so is the charge that it was doctored and the overall characterization of biden s record doesn t appropriately capture the full context of what was going on but on the core point the video misstep has allowed biden s camp to try to avoid confronting the facts for the vast majority of his career biden has been a deficit hawk who s willing to sacrifice social security and medicare benefits for the sake of achieving smaller budget gaps he s even bragged about it to establish a rhetorical contrast with republican fiscal irresponsibility and unlike some biden related controversies this isn t ancient history it s a position biden maintained as barack obama s vice president and that sanders and warren fought against consequently behind the fog of fact checks is a real question about electability in a world where even the gop s leader has mostly abandoned the idea of scaling back retirement programs but even more profoundly the argument reveals a question about governance one that frames the actual choices available differently than the typical revolution versus pragmatism argument that s dominated the democratic campaign so far what kinds of concessions should or would the next president make in order to advance other priorities the tale of the tape sirota s claim that biden lauded paul ryan links to a column by the week s ryan cooper published about a year ago cooper was running with an interpretation of a 2018 biden speech at the brookings institution that was first offered by sirota himself and flagged as misleading by ben cohen the text of what biden said is a bit ambiguous and to understand what s happening you probably need to watch it on video but here is a selection of the transcript that puts his remarks in context with the key line sirota is quoting in bold as i say where i come from get a life look what s happened with the latest tax cut once again those at the very top get the biggest breaks and what do we have to show for it even our republican friends are now beginning to admit there s no evidence these tax cuts are being put to work in the economy no new growth just more debt and that puts middle class programs that they rely on and they ve worked for at real risk paul ryan was correct when he did the tax code what s the first thing he decided we had to go after social security and medicare now we need to do something about social security and medicare that s the only way you can find room to pay for it now i don t know a whole lot of people in the top one tenth of 1 percent or the top 1 percent who are relying on social security when they retire i don t know a lot of them maybe you guys do so we need a pro growth progressive tax code that treats workers as job creators as well not just investors that gets rid of unprotective loopholes like stepped up basis and it raises enough revenue to make sure that the social security and medicare can stay it still needs adjustments but can stay and pay for the things we all acknowledge will grow the country if you watch the video biden is saying that stuff about social security and medicare in a funny affected voice it s supposed to be satirizing paul ryan s view the view that first you do a regressive tax cut that makes the budget deficit bigger and then later you come around to cut social security and medicare biden isn t calling for social security cuts and he certainly isn t lauding ryan he s saying that ryan s preferred tax policies policies that biden opposed will lead inevitably to cuts in popular retirement programs this is close to the reverse of the view sirota attributes to him which is odd because biden really has advocated cuts to social security on various occasions over the years joe biden is a longtime deficit hawk the connective tissue between the times biden has proposed social security cuts and the time biden criticized ryan is that for most of his career biden has taken the view that a large budget deficit is bad he signed on to a balanced budget amendment proposal way back in 1995 for example the core problem with social security to deficit hawks is that for various reasons the long term projected revenue raised by social security taxes will not be sufficient to cover the benefits that have been promised over the long term while republicans have at times tried to use this imbalance as a pretext to privatize the program mainstream democrats have been more likely to see it as a problem that needs to be fixed with a mix of higher taxes and lower spending for illustrative examples of what that might look like you can delve into a 2005 blueprint released by peter diamond whom obama later tried to appoint to a federal reserve board seat and peter orszag who served as obama s office of management and budget director for years or a 2010 plan that the obama aligned center for american progress think tank put out in this vein the same sirota email that was misleading about biden s 2018 speech accurately flagged a biden retirement security plan from his 2008 campaign that floated the idea of raising the retirement age specifically asked by tim russert during that campaign if he was open to cutting social security and medicare he said you ve got to put all of it on the table the larger context here is that when george w bush was president democrats routinely assailed him for running up a high budget deficit and frequently forecast dire consequences to come if it was not addressed and one thing you have to understand to make sense of obama s first term in office is that mainstream democrats were completely sincere about this as columbia university s adam tooze writes in crashed his history of the great recession obama and his team were already prepared for an economic crisis before it arrived the problem is they were prepared for the wrong crisis a crisis of confidence in the us dollar and soaring interest rates provoked by bush s irresponsible fiscal policy in his book the audacity of hope obama writes that solving america s problems will be hard it will require tough choices and it will require sacrifice unless political leaders are open to new ideas and not just new packaging we won t change enough hearts and minds to initiate a serious energy policy or tame the deficit at another point he observes that the problems with the social security trust fund are real but manageable in 1983 when facing a similar problem ronald reagan and house speaker tip o neill got together and shaped a bipartisan plan that stabilized the system for the next sixty years there s no reason we can t do the same today the reagan o neill plan was a balanced package of tax hikes and benefit cuts exactly what the diamond orszag plan featured and what biden meant when he said you ve got to put all of it on the table and exactly what obama meant when he said we would need tough choices and sacrifice the underlying presumption of this is that the deficit was a major long term problem comparable to climate change and that s a view that persisted into obama s administration even though he wound up getting the wrong crisis the grand bargain era by the time obama took office it was clear that democratic party deficit hawks had been preparing for the wrong crisis during the financial crisis that precipitated the great recession the value of the dollar went up not down and interest rates went down rather than up and all this happened even though the recession itself automatically pushed the deficit up quite a bit the administration responded sensibly with a stimulus package that made the deficit even larger but once the stimulus was enacted and especially after getting beaten badly in the 2010 midterms the administration pivoted back to the deficit question even though it had no immediate urgency this eventually took the form of a search for a grand bargain between the administration and house republicans one that would pair tax increases with cuts to long term spending on entitlement programs initially the hope was that a grand bargain would be reached as part of a deal to raise the statutory debt ceiling that failed and instead the debt ceiling was raised but paired with big automatic short term cuts to discretionary spending on both military and non military spending the idea was that ultimately both democrats and republicans would prefer a grand bargain on long term issues to economically harmful short term cuts and so would reach the bargain in order to avert them that effort failed too last but by no means least was the fiscal cliff occurring shortly after obama won reelection when the white house tried and failed to get house republicans to agree to a deal that would raise taxes and cut long term spending in all these cases cuts to social security typically either raising the age at which one could claim full benefits switching the cost of living adjustments to a less generous measure of inflation or both were broadly speaking on the table and in all cases the obama administration biden included was very much hoping for a deal the reason social security and medicare left the obama years untouched was fundamentally that republicans didn t want to make a deal rather than raising taxes and cutting entitlements their idea outlined in multiple budget documents written by paul ryan was to cut taxes as well as entitlement spending meanwhile a dissident faction of left wing democrats led by sanders and warren said this was a bad idea that the search for a grand bargain was misguided and that social security should be expanded rather than cut this group was not influential during the search for a grand bargain had a deal been reached it simply would have passed without their votes but in part due to republican intransigence they wound up winning the argument lots of people have changed their position bernie sanders has the same position on social security in 2020 that he had in 2011 it should be expanded elizabeth warren too is a longtime champion of expanding social security and for the 2020 campaign she outlined a social security expansion plan that is even more generous than the one sanders has embraced most other leading figures in american politics however have shifted positions generally to the left of where they were five to 10 years ago the shifts were to an extent gradual in early 2014 obama released a budget proposal that unlike the ones from his previous few years no longer included the idea of cutting social security by switching to the less generous inflation index then in june 2016 obama came out in favor of expanding social security benefits biden seems to have broadly tracked obama s thinking in his 2018 brookings speech he s not talking about doing a grand bargain he s complaining that gop tax cuts are imperiling social security and in the summer of 2019 he fleshed out his social security expansion proposal meanwhile donald trump won the 2016 election but he also ruined the gop establishment s plan to cut entitlements without a grand bargain trump as a candidate vowed to avoid cuts to social security medicare and medicaid i was the first only potential gop candidate to state there will be no cuts to social security medicare medicaid huckabee copied me donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 7 2015 as president he has flagrantly violated those promises on medicaid backing bills that would have enacted sweeping cuts and doing everything in his power to use executive discretion to toss people off the program trump s budget director and chief of staff mick mulvaney meanwhile has bragged about talking trump into supporting cuts to parts of social security by convincing him that social security disability insurance isn t really social security the name is a hint that it is and his promise really only covered old age benefits but trump really has avoided cuts in benefits for retirees which helped give him a moderate image with a critical swath of voters and has changed the basic pattern of american political arguments one important consequence of this is that mitch mcconnell who helped kill the grand bargain when obama and biden wanted one now says he wants a bipartisan deal to adjust those programs and reduce the deficit this sets up an important question of what will happen if trump loses in 2020 joe biden wants to get things done if you view the whole history of their respective records in context the sanders camp is going too far in trying to pitch biden as some kind of fanatical social security slasher biden did for a long time buy into the idea that it was critically important to try to reach a bipartisan deal on deficit reduction even if such a deal entailed significant cuts to social security and medicare sanders and warren by contrast always opposed such dealmaking at the end of the day it turned out not to matter because republicans weren t interested but unlike many of the other domestic issues that candidates have argued about in the 2020 cycle the gap here has real implications there are at least some indications that mcconnell and other gop leaders may have changed their minds on a deficit deal and while nobody running for office is going to discuss in detail the specific outlines of unsavory compromises they might be willing to make with a gop legislative majority the candidates records indicate that if mcconnell were interested in making a deal biden would be a lot more willing than sanders to give up social security cuts if he could get something in exchange that he thought was important biden has mused sporadically about the possibility of a post election epiphany that would restore bipartisan cooperation to washington generally only to be met with derision but while an epiphany almost certainly isn t in the cards it s not out of the question that post trump congressional republicans would decide that they were too intransigent on the specific grand bargain question and want to make a deal with a biden administration a warren or sanders administration would almost certainly reject any such overtures whereas biden like obama before him might see concessions on social security as a potentially viable way of moving the ball forward on other priorities
stocks rise as zombie companies proliferate share prices on the major us exchanges are hitting all time highs at the same time that both the number and percentage of companies that do not make any money at all are rising according to the wall street journal the percentage of publicly traded companies in the u s that have lost money over the past 12 months has jumped close to 40 of all listed corporations its highest level since the nasdaq bubble and outside of post recession periods in fact 74 of initial public offerings in 2019 didn t make any money as opposed to just 25 in 1990 matching the total of money losing ventures that ipoed at the height of the 2000 dotcom mania the percentage of all listed companies that have lost money for the past three years in a row has surged close to 30 this compares with just over 10 for the trailing three years in the late 1990s the insane behavior of markets can be blamed squarely on central banks and their zeal to perpetuate asset bubbles by forcing interest rates into the sub basement of history this of course causes savers to leap far out along the risk curve in search of a yield that is far greater than the asinine 2 inflation target from which the fed has vastly eclipsed long ago this market insanity isn t completely lost on those who occupy the c suite in corporate america according to a recent survey of u s corporate cfos done by deloitte 77 of respondents said stocks are overvalued while just 4 said equities are undervalued and a full 97 of respondents say that an economic slowdown already has begun or will start sometime in 2020 perhaps the reason why the fed has the repo market in the intensive care unit is precisely because corporate bond prices are nearing the edge of a gigantic chasm the federal reserve bank of ny is so concerned about the liquidity of money markets that it had to add another 83 1 billion in temporary liquidity to financial markets on thursday jan 9th alone adding to the pile of about a half trillion dollars worth of fresh monetary expansion since mid september of last year all this largesse offered by the fed at record low rates has indeed led to its desired effect corporations rushed to sell 69 billion in investment grade ig corporate debt during the first full week of 2020 the second highest amount ever in a one week period according to bank of america securities the rate on the ice bank of america investment grade corporate bond index has plunged to a paltry 2 87 as investors chase risk in a desperate search for any kind of yield the bbb tranche of ig debt which is just one notch above junk and comprises 50 of all ig debt is yielding just 3 18 that record low yield is a full 300 bps lower than it was prior to the great recession the truth is there s a record amount of corporate debt which has the lowest quality of composition and trades at the lowest yields ever around the world there is a half trillion dollars worth of negative yielding corporate bonds that are held by individuals that hope to sell it at a higher price and fast because holding a bond to maturity that pays less than the principal guarantees a loss in nominal terms and with a much fatter minus sign attached to it when inflation is factored into the equation nevertheless corporate bond prices continue to climb along with share prices even though earnings growth has absconded according to factset the q4 2019 s p 500 y y earnings will be negative 2 if the q4 earnings season turns out to be a negative number at all it marks four straight quarters of y y negative eps growth but falling earnings doesn t seem to matter to stock investors much at all when the fed keeps the confetti machine blowing at full speed and deteriorating credit quality of corporation doesn t seem to faze them either while the stock market surges to new highs the credit quality of the u s government is faltering as fast as corporate debt the budget deficit reached 1 02 trillion for the 12 month calendar year ending in december and the deficit increased to 357 billion in the first three months of this fiscal year 2020 oct nov and dec this deficit is the largest in seven years it was only higher during the aftermath of the great recession but remember this is supposed to be the best economy ever however it is not and when the economy starts to contract the annual budget deficits should spike north of 2 5 trillion due to automatic economic stabilizers just as corporate bond yields become completely unglued the continuation of this phony bull market and ersatz economy is predicated on borrowing costs staying at a record low levels forever this is despite the fact that the level of debt is unsurpassed and growing higher each day this is the same condition as the real estate bust of 2008 1 5 trillion dollars worth of us mortgage debt was owed by borrowers who couldn t pay back the loans once home prices stopped rising and interest rates began to rise only this time around it is going to be much worse over 5 trillion worth of corporate debt will most likely become insolvent once the economy stalls and zombie corporations get shut out of the credit markets due to spiking borrowing costs in the interim it is ok to dance on top of these bubbles but only if you have a robust model that gives enough warning ahead of time to sprint towards the extremely narrow emergency exit otherwise you will buy and hold and dollar cost average your account to penury if you doubt that just ask the japanese in 1989 how holding on to stocks worked out up until now the day of reckoning has been held in abeyance by central banks willingness to drop borrowing costs to near nothing and by engaging in perpetual qe but this strategy only works for a while now that money has been offered around the globe for virtually free and for a very long time there isn t much central banks can do to thwart the next recession outside of dropping money from helicopters a k a direct debt

based on 2019 figures about 78 of the global gdp of 86 31 trillion is attributable to the sixteen economies in the trillion dollar club if we look even closer the top five countries in terms of nominal gdp the u s china japan germany and india contribute a whopping 55 to the world s gdp here s a look at how these five countries are poised to grow in 2020 united states the united states the world s largest economy with a nominal gdp of 21 44 trillion constitutes one fourth of the world economy the u s economy is primarily a service oriented economy with a 77 contribution to gdp with the jobless rate hitting record lows at 3 5 contribution to gdp coming from a majority 17 out of 22 of industry groups and the stock markets soaring at all time highs this has been a great period for the u s economy however problems linger with regards to its trading partners and trump s trade wars rising debt levels and its industrial output among other issues the trouble between the u s and china on trade is negatively impacting not just these two countries but many others a study by unctad concluded that consumers in the u s are bearing the heaviest brunt of the u s tariffs on china as their associated costs have largely been passed down to them and importing firms in the form of higher prices during 2018 the u s trade deficit with china was at 419 52 billion while it was at 320 82 billion during the first eleven months of 2019 in addition the u s current account deficit which reflects the combined balances on trade in goods and services and income flows between u s residents and residents of other countries was 124 1 billion during the third quarter of 2019 or 2 3 of u s gdp the imf sees u s gdp at 2 in 2020 and will decline further to 1 7 in 2021 the u s economy is set to grow to 25 8 trillion by 2024 with its gdp per capita at rising to 76 252 from the current 65 111 china china officially the people s republic of china is the second largest economy in the world and the fastest growing trillion dollar economy with a gdp of 14 14 trillion in 2019 it makes up 16 38 of the global economy when compared on the basis of purchasing power parity ppp china is the largest economy with a gdp ppp of 27 31 trillion based on 2019 figures the size of china s nominal gdp was lesser than that of u s by around 7 3 trillion the gap is expected reduce to around 4 5 trillion by 2024 china is on the path to become a 20 trillion economy by 2024 china has had trouble with the u s on the trade front a series of tariffs and counter retaliatory tariffs among other restrictions resulted in a trade war been the two biggest economies to avoid further escalation u s and china entered a trade deal in early 2020 which involves partial rollback of past tariffs and pause in additional tariff hikes in the first phase while the trade deal has alleviated near term cyclical weakness the unresolved disputes on broader china u s economic relations and ongoing structural showdown is likely to weigh on china s growth china is projected to grow at 6 in 2020 and by 5 8 in 2021 japan japan the third largest economy in the world contributes almost 6 to the global gdp the financial crisis of 2008 09 took a toll on the japanese economy it was the only major advanced economy that experienced negative economic growth in 2008 and continued to contract sharply in 2009 the impact of the sub prime crisis that originated in the u s on the japanese economy was majorly due to the severe impact on japan s exports the economy has remained fragile ever since when prime minister shinzo abe came to power in 2012 one of his priorities was to end deflation while ensuring fiscal discipline the initiatives to revive the economy have become popularly known as abenomics japan s gdp touched 5 trillion in 2019 and is expected to grow at 0 7 in 2020 this is an upgrade from earlier estimates which comes on the back of the fiscal package of 122 billion announced in december 2019 japan s economy is expected to expand to 6 26 billion by 2024 based on current growth estimates japan has a healthy gdp per capita of 40 846 which is expected to rise to 50 637 by 2024 germany with a gdp of 3 86 trillion germany is the fourth largest economy in the world and the largest economy in europe the world bank estimates that approximately 47 4 of its gdp is dependent on the export of goods and services which makes it vulnerable to external shocks this became evident during the financial crisis of 2008 09 when the economy contracted by 5 7 2009 however ever since it has grown in each of the last ten years amid multiple challenges in the recent times the economy has been hit by the sluggish global trade declines in export orders and industrial production the continuing trade disputes and brexit uncertainty which have weighted on business confidence and investment scenario have further compounded the problems germany is projected to grow at 1 1 in 2020 and 1 4 in 2021 higher than 0 5 in 2019 by 2023 24 germany and india would be very close to each other in terms of the size of the nominal gdp making it a close contest for the spot of the fourth largest world economy although in terms of gdp per capita germany 46 563 is way ahead of india 2 171 india india the fifth largest economy has often been dubbed as the bright spot in the global economy has seen a substantial downgrade in its growth projection by the imf india s growth has been impacted by country specific issues such as stress in the non bank financial sector decline in credit growth cooling private consumption slowing industrial activity and stagnant investments steps such as the introduction of a goods and services tax an insolvency and bankruptcy code and measures to recapitalize public sector banks are being taken however a lot needs to be done to revive its economy especially in areas such as labor reforms and infrastructure to ensure that india is recognized as a strong contender in the global supply chain a 4 8 growth in 2019 has led the imf to the reassessment of growth prospects over the next two years which underpins india s contribution to global growth after a disappointing 2019 the imf projects india s gdp to expand by 5 8 in 2020 and 6 5 in 2021 on the assumption of adequate monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as subdued oil prices based on current projections india is expected to become a 3 2 trillion economy in 2020 and reach 4 6 trillion by 2024 while india is the third largest economy in purchasing parity terms its rank drops substantially in terms of gdp per capita here s a snapshot of the trillion dollar economies the rankings are based on imf data for nominal gdp for year 2019 while growth rates are based on imf projections released in january 2020 nominal gdp also mentioned as gdp is at current prices u s dollars while gdp ppp is the gdp based on purchasing power parity ppp valuation of country gdp current

introduction and summary graduate programs enroll 15 percent of all students in higher education yet they account for 40 percent of federal student loans issued each year 1 see table 1 that is more than 37 billion in loans each year an amount 20 percent larger than the total annual undergraduate borrowing at public colleges 2 while this report does not recommend a specific approach it is adamant about the need for solutions for student debt taken on at graduate schools failing to tackle this area would undercut the overall quest for making higher education affordable because massive investments in undergraduate education could still be easily undone in graduate school it is time for a serious discussion about how to bring down debt for the forgotten borrowers attending graduate schools tackling graduate debt is an important complement to other policy ideas for future college affordability or to address the situations of borrowers who already have debt these additional policy ideas include the center for american progress beyond tuition proposal and the ideas for helping existing loan borrowers outlined in cap s report addressing the 1 5 trillion in federal student loan debt 6 these ideas would transform college financing for future students or help those who already have debt but none of the plans currently address how to rein in future graduate school loans while the above suggestions could be applied irrespective of program type this report also considers potential ways to address some of the most common types of credentials while these options likely would not be needed if the other policy ideas were adopted it is still worth exploring targeted fixes if broader solutions are not workable these include the following while these concerns are legitimate the worries about graduate debt are too pervasive to stop the discussion or reforms in this area that is why the purpose of this report is to launch an important new conversation about overlooked aspects of student debt and to grapple with some of the major pros and cons of each idea it intentionally does not endorse specific solutions because there is no single approach and no one best fix to this problem it does stipulate that these proposals should place a greater emphasis on accountability rather than spending new money for two reasons first additional federal dollars for higher education are best invested in public undergraduate education and private minority serving institutions that have faced historical discrimination and underinvestment second the rise in expensive programs and debt does not appear to be driven by the same underlying cost shifting that is occurring in public higher education at the undergraduate level these are admittedly aggressive solutions that present significant political and policy challenges many of the solutions run into a broader philosophical question about whether the responsibility for ensuring manageable debt levels should live with higher education institutions government employers or the student to ensure that graduates are neither trapped in a cycle of debt nor set up for economic hardship when they enter the workforce this is a crucial question when there are degrees such as a master s in teaching or social work that credentialing regimes require in order to work in a field in which the pay does not reflect the cost of getting that training similarly reforms to bring down graduate debt could eliminate low return degrees but also risk constricting supply or degrading quality effects such as these have the potential for significant equity worries in terms of who might be denied access or enrolled in places that sacrifice quality in order to make the math work on price this report lays out bold ideas to tackle student debt from graduate studies for programs that range from one year certificates to doctoral degrees that can take close to a decade to earn these ideas include enacting price caps judging programs on a debt to earnings rate and tackling specific credentials by eliminating a year of law school or ensuring that credentials required for teaching or social work are affordable based on what graduates will make the sustained rise in graduate debt also has substantial equity implications particularly for black students black students are more likely to borrow in graduate school and have more undergraduate debt than their white peers see table 2 as a result the median debt for a black student borrower finishing graduate school is 50 percent higher than that of a white borrower societal pay disparities also mean that women with graduate degrees receive salaries comparable to their less educated male peers the result is that individuals seeking graduate education to address pervasive societal pay gaps will end up paying more for those credentials over the long run there is growing evidence that the current debt system which allows graduate students to borrow an essentially uncapped amount at rather expensive rates is unsustainable for many borrowers these problems are different from the issues in undergraduate education which include high default rates and worries that students with debt but without a degree are likely to struggle rather the problems with graduate student debt concern whether debt levels are manageable or likely to drag down borrowers for years if not decades more than 40 percent of loan balances over 60 000 are now being repaid using income driven repayment idr payment plans that are based on a borrower s income which is double the rate for balances below 60 000 5 and because interest will keep growing on at least some of these balances many of these borrowers may well find themselves negatively amortizing meaning that their balance grows even as they make payments these borrowers will be trapped in a situation where their only way out from debt will be to seek forgiveness of any remaining amounts after 20 years or more in repayment federal loans for graduate school have also kept growing even as a better economy and demographic changes have driven declines in undergraduate enrollment and borrowing from the 2010 11 academic year to the 2017 18 academic year graduate borrowing increased by 2 3 billion 3 by contrast undergraduate borrowing declined by almost 15 billion during that same time period 4 see table 1 the current state of graduate loan debt the federal government can no longer be a silent aider and abettor in these graduate debt trends few of these graduate programs could keep their doors open without federal loans and there is nothing in the existing federal system of accountability that ensures graduate programs will be priced fairly and reasonably the federal government has both the authority and the moral imperative to make sure that educational debt for graduate school does not hobble future generations of americans finally many graduate schools also appear to be using some graduate degrees as profit centers for the institution 15 several schools are creating expensive online programs that allow them to enroll more students than they could in person the urban institute s kristin blagg found that the share of students seeking a master s degree entirely online tripled from 2008 to 2016 from 10 percent to 31 percent 16 by contrast she found that only 12 percent of bachelor s degree students are in fully online programs many institutions are also turning to private companies to power their online programs entering into revenue agreements where these corporations take a substantial share of tuition revenue and handle all the recruiting work 17 while the effect of these private providers on the price of the programs has been a subject of much debate they allow incredibly expensive programs to enroll far more people than they could in a brick and mortar setting and thanks to the uncapped federal loans schools can offer credentials with prices far out of line with any reasonable earnings expectation such as a master s in social work that has median debt of 115 000 and first year earnings of just 49 400 18 while there has been less discussion about what effect if any state cuts have on graduate school pricing there are several reasons why it is likely less of an issue one is that about half of graduate students are enrolled in private colleges that by and large do not receive state operating subsidies 13 by contrast private colleges enroll 22 percent of undergraduate students second the price difference between attending an in state versus out of state graduate program may be less than it is for undergraduate education at least for the pricier professional programs in areas such as law or business 14 the causes behind the rise of graduate debt are also different from those in undergraduate education in the latter s case a big factor driving increases in debt is a decline of state investment that has shifted a larger share of the expense of college onto the backs of students 12 this means that tuition dollars are covering costs that decades ago would have been supported by public subsidies the interest terms on federal graduate loans are worse than for undergraduate debts for the 2019 20 academic year the average interest rate on graduate loans is 1 55 percentage points higher than that on undergraduate loans 11 the interest rate for grad plus loans meanwhile is 2 55 percentage points higher than that on undergraduate loans graduate loans also do not receive the interest subsidies available for about half of undergraduate loans which cover any interest that accumulates while a borrower is in school or during their first few years of idr to top it all off grad plus loans also come with an origination fee of more than 4 percent having greater amounts of debt for graduate school also matters because these loans have different terms than undergraduate options for one there is essentially no hard dollar cap on graduate school loans undergraduate students may borrow no more than 31 000 over their college career if they are a dependent student and no more than 57 500 if they are financially independent adults 9 graduate students meanwhile can borrow 20 500 a year and 138 500 total through one loan program if they need more than that they can then tap into the grad plus program which allows a student to borrow an amount up to the full cost of attendance charged by the college as a result nearly one quarter of graduate borrowers took out more than the lifetime loan limit for dependent undergraduates in just a single year of graduate school 10 that includes just under 70 percent of borrowers seeking a professional degree in areas such as law or medicine as table 2 shows black and latinx graduate students are more likely to go into debt than their white peers and those who finish end up with much more total debt almost 90 percent of black or african american students who took on federal loans for graduate school and finished in the 2015 16 academic year had debt from undergraduate studies black students median federal debt for graduate school was about 25 percent higher than that of their white peers and their total federal debt was 25 000 higher although latinx students end up with debt levels closer to those of their white peers those who borrowed for graduate school and finished in 2015 16 were more likely to have undergraduate debt than their white counterparts 82 percent compared with 75 percent and end up with about 5 000 more in total debt fears that graduate school could retrench economic mobility are particularly problematic because women black and latinx students often need to earn a credential beyond the bachelor s degree to receive pay akin to less educated men and white individuals respectively on average women need to earn a master s degree to exceed the lifetime earnings of men with an associate degree 8 the results are similar when comparing students who are black or latinx with white individuals the continued rise of graduate school debt has significant equity implications that must be addressed for one there is evidence that graduate school can undercut the ability of bachelor s degrees to promote intergenerational mobility beginning with florencia torche s 2011 study evidence shows that there is substantial economic mobility for individuals who only have a bachelor s degree meaning that the chances of achieving economic success are independent of social background among those who attain a ba 7 however the pattern does not hold among advanced degree holders for whom background strongly affects mobility particularly for men this suggests that if left unchecked graduate school has the potential to hinder all the efforts at boosting mobility that come from undergraduate education graduate school is more than just a continuation of undergraduate education the equity implications of graduate debt the less generous and less restrictive nature of graduate loan structures and the forces driving the supply of graduate education highlight the need for new policy solutions options for graduate school programs solving debt in graduate education requires both broad solutions and those that are targeted to specific fields within just one college graduate programs may include a one year master s a four year medical degree and doctoral programs that take nearly a decade to finish and each may be run by its own unit within the college that handles admissions pricing and aid the debt drivers and solutions thus may range widely across those programs below are a range of potential policies that create indirect or direct incentives to bring down the price of graduate programs including some that tackle the underlying costs but graduate education is also an area ripe for innovation for one the degrees can vary more widely than the traditional four year bachelor s degree or two year associate degree the professional nature of graduate education also makes it easier to find better ways to link programs to workforce and employer demands overall this could mean breaking apart long held views on the length of time required to earn some credentials or requiring more specific proof of the credential s value in the job market by looking at the earnings of completers judge programs on a debt to earnings rate in 2011 the u s department of education published the first iteration of its gainful employment rule a regulation that holds career training programs accountable if loan payments represent too large a share of income for students who received federal aid and finished the program of study that regulation defined a long standing statutory requirement that certain programs and types of institutions had to show they provided training leading to gainful employment in a recognized occupation it then released a new version of the rule in 2014 after a judge invalidated the initial iteration gainful employment applies to all nondegree programs such as certificates regardless of the type of college that offers them as well as effectively all degree programs at private for profit colleges if a program fails to stay under the prescribed debt to income ratio defined in the gainful employment regulation for multiple years the program loses access to federal aid 19 thus the rule puts pressure on colleges to keep debt balances below a reasonable share of income although the current administration rescinded the gainful employment regulation the rule had a significant effect on overpriced programs while it existed roughly 60 percent of the programs that had debt to earnings ratios above acceptable levels shut down even before the rule would have terminated their financial aid 20 it forced colleges to more carefully evaluate their programs in order to rethink price and quality or to eliminate those in fields such as criminal justice that might have had student demand but lacked return 21 there have been proposals to expand gainful employment to all other degree programs both undergraduate and graduate but there are several reasons why expanding the requirement to graduate programs is more sensible first many graduate programs are explicitly professional in nature so the notion of tying federal support to adequate borrower earnings makes sense second graduate admissions operate much more at the program level meaning students apply directly to a law school or business school rather than the larger university and it is harder to transfer between programs this makes it easier to separate out and evaluate individual graduate programs this approach could also be made less punitive by creating consequences that do not go as far as cutting off financial aid for example programs could be subject to tailored loan limits set at some portion of discretionary income for the typical graduate who has been in the workforce for a few years the limit could be based on outcomes for graduates of that program or for everyone who finished a given program type this approach would be more tolerant of high debt but still address programs that are priced out of line with earnings such as the more than 100 000 master s in social work degree at the university of southern california which prepares graduates for an occupation with typical earnings of just under 50 000 per year 22 table 3 provides a few examples of hypothetical loan cap amounts these amounts do not include any assumptions about undergraduate debt aside from complexity the biggest downside of a tailored loan limit approach is that it could cause problems at programs that have a societal need but at which the price to obtain the credential is far out of line with the pay involved this would most likely occur in areas such as teaching or social work which might have debt caps that are thousands of dollars below program prices this issue raises an important philosophical question for these types of programs whose responsibility is it to make the return on investment calculation work out for careers that generally demand graduate credentials but have lower wages should the federal government subsidize the debt so that graduates can manage it through income driven repayment should colleges be required to keep prices down or must state and local governments typically employing these individuals raise wages to better reflect the educational demands the fact that most graduate borrowers already have undergraduate debt can also complicate the effectiveness of a debt to earnings calculation a program could look like it has an acceptable debt load for students based just on what they owe for graduate school but the total amount of loans held could be unmanageable it would be unfair to judge a graduate program on the total indebtedness figure since it cannot control what a student owed from prior credentials and doing so could risk a program turning away lower income students who had to borrow for their undergraduate education but the debt to earnings approach would at least ensure that the graduate debt alone is manageable enacting a debt to earnings requirement for graduate programs must be done separate from efforts to restore the gainful employment regulation to be clear enacting a debt to earnings requirement for graduate programs must be done separate from efforts to restore the gainful employment regulation while there are worries for both graduate programs and career training options the problems with the latter are more concerning traditionally calls for applying gainful employment requirements for all programs are a delaying tactic that avoids accountability for any program types this recommendation rejects the idea that accountability for career training programs should wait until a debt to earnings measure is applied more broadly to graduate programs hold programs accountable for loan repayment and idr usage rather than capping debt based on the earnings of completers graduate programs could instead be held accountable if many students are unable to repay their debts or are heavily reliant on options such as idr which sets payments at a share of income this has the advantage of allowing higher debt programs to continue operating as long as their outcomes justify the investment unlike current policies that apply to undergraduate loans the focus is on repayment instead of default because projected default rates are already very low for graduate borrowers likely due to the fact that having a bachelor s degree increases their earning potential and therefore their ability to pay down debt 23 there are good policy reasons for being worried about the excessive usage of idr for students the issue comes down to interest accumulation and the possibility of paying more overall on their loans while idr plans have different rules for forgiving some interest many borrowers can and likely will see their balances grow if their payments are too low that can result in them potentially paying much more over the life of the loan or owing a significant tax bill 20 years down the line when their remaining balances are forgiven 24 taxpayers meanwhile pick up the other end of the costs that borrowers don t bear that means covering interest that is forgiven during repayment as well as any amounts forgiven after 20 or more years in repayment while the notion of some government costs for idr is reasonable a system that results in borrowers paying a lot more for longer and taxpayers picking up the forgiveness tab while the program avoids any consequences for generating debt that could not be repaid is not fair the challenge with judging programs on idr usage is that it creates a tension between the use of a federal benefit for students and potential consequences for graduate programs an overindebted borrower who needs payment relief absolutely should pursue idr if it will help them avoid default and the ruinous consequences associated with it but some students might be able to pay a higher share of their earnings yet prefer the payment relief which a school cannot control that means judging programs on idr usage could result in them encouraging some borrowers to not use a federal benefit that is available to them signing up for idr is also outside programs direct control so they could label this as an unfair form of accountability finally students could end up using idr not because their graduate debt balance alone is too high but because they cannot afford payments on those loans combined with what they already owe for their undergraduate education looking at idr usage thus risks discouraging programs from enrolling students who had to borrow for their bachelor s degree given these challenges attempts to judge programs on idr usage or repayment rates should pursue one of two avenues one approach is to set the threshold for acceptable idr usage very high such as a at large majority of borrowers this means the government will only worry about idr usage when it becomes the overwhelmingly common repayment option for students this still has some concerns about discouraging borrowers but programs above the cap would have a harder time arguing that the overreliance on idr is not a function of too much debt alternatively policymakers could enact a repayment rate regime alongside changes to interest accumulation on idr for example forgiving all interest for the first three years on idr and then judging programs on the share of balances paid down after five years would give borrowers time to land on their feet and ensure that negative amortization is not just a result of students going on idr while they find a job in their first few months after leaving school the consequences attached to a repayment rate or an idr usage metric also matter these indicators are less well suited to severe penalties such as making programs ineligible for federal loans because of worries that some repayment decisions are outside programs control instead a system of either capping debt or requiring risk sharing payments is a better consequence for programs that are too reliant on idr or for which borrowers cannot repay create dollar based caps for graduate loans if an outcomes based approach to limit debt is too complex the federal government could instead create new annual and aggregate limits that cap how much money a student can borrow for graduate school 25 this moves away from the current regime where institutions determine limits by setting their cost of attendance at the very least these limits would have to vary by credential type and length since there are significant differences in anticipated debt levels for a one year master s degree versus a multiyear doctorate even then there may still need to be variation for specific types of programs for example medical and dental degrees cost a lot more to operate and thus charge much higher tuition than most other types of doctorates dollar caps on loans also have the benefit of avoiding concerns about how the interaction between graduate and undergraduate debt could affect borrower choices around the use of idr or potentially understate the full amount owed on a debt to earnings calculation there are however significant risks associated with stricter loan caps lower federal limits could create a larger market for private loans with poor terms and fewer repayment protections such a substitution is arguably worse than simply keeping the existing loan structures one way to address this would be to prohibit schools from certifying any private loans above the federal cap and to remove any repayment protections that those types of debts currently receive such as being almost impossible to discharge in bankruptcy this would not fully address direct to consumer private loans but might make it a little harder to generate more nonfederal debt while this report does not consider how dollar based caps could be determined any process to set them must ensure that limits do not get constructed in ways that create equity concerns this problem could arise by setting caps that are lower for programs such as master s programs in education or social work that are more likely to enroll borrowers who are women black or latinx 26 this again raises the question about the best way to address broader societal mismatches between credentials needed for certain professions and pay for those jobs while debt limits cannot solve the pay side of the equation any loan cap should at least come with an equity analysis to ensure it does not create disparate effects any cap on graduate debt would have to come as part of a deal that did not require reducing spending elsewhere to make this change finally this policy suffers from a major budgetary downside graduate loans especially grad plus loans currently score as making large sums of money for the federal government as a result any plan to cap these debts would change the expected revenue they bring in and thus cost money given the need to fund many other federal higher education programs any cap on graduate debt would have to come as part of a deal that did not require reducing spending elsewhere to make this change ban balance billing it is common in higher education for students and families to face direct academic charges well in excess of what federal financial aid and an expected family contribution provide this is often referred to as gapping students 27 this bears some similarities to the concept of balance billing in health care charging patients an amount of money in excess of what their insurance company will pay for a service 28 the federal government already bans balance billing in some health care contexts such as the medicare advantage program medicare advantage offers insurance plans from private providers that an individual can select instead of typical medicare coverage to keep the costs of these plans down medicare advantage plans set expectations for patient cost sharing ban all balance billing for participating providers and cap charges at 115 percent of the medicare rate for nonparticipating providers 29 that means that the provider of health care services cannot charge a patient an amount too far in excess of what medicare would pay for that service a similar approach in higher education would set maximum amounts that the federal government was willing to pay expressed in terms of how much in federal loans it would provide student and family cost sharing could be determined through a needs analysis that determines a reasonable amount with caps that limit how far above those amounts a school could go this needs analysis would need to be different from the existing system which typically produces unrealistic expectations for students and families and generates an expected family contribution that is not actually an expression of what they are likely to pay 30 it would be reasonable for the allowable loan debt to go somewhat above the contribution amount to acknowledge that some borrowing for graduate school is acceptable banning balance billing has some similarities to ideas for tackling undergraduate affordability such as cap s beyond tuition proposal both ideas involve setting clear limits on what families or students can pay out of pocket the big difference is that beyond tuition presumes significant increases in federal spending on college to make it so that families can attend school where they would only use debt if they could not afford their expected contribution banning balance billing in graduate school however does not assume new federal money for affordability and it would presume some borrowing as part of the family contribution just not as much debt as students take on today living expenses represent a challenge to the balance billing concept apart from dorms dining halls bus lines or other services run by colleges it is hard to hold institutions accountable for the cost of living near campus some students may also already have families or dependents that have child care costs or other things that are not directly in the school s control as a result any kind of balance billing prohibition would need to consider how to allocate the federal aid and family contribution so that it does not get entirely swallowed up by the college leaving nothing left over for rent or food given these challenges any approach that makes bills more predictable and reasonable such as standardizing room and board calculations or setting amounts by geographic region would be a step forward a bundled payment model is another way to simultaneously address academic and living expense costs bundled payment is a health care concept in which the insurer pays a set amount for all elements of a specific health event for example a bundled payment for hip replacement could cover the surgeon anesthesiologist hospitalization and follow up rehabilitation instead of separate charges for each 31 in higher education the federal government could create a bundled payment that combines the academic and living expense elements of the price this bundled payment approach could thus separate out within the allocation what the school can receive versus what can go to other expenses institute price caps many of the solutions outlined above address a core issue that the price for a program is too high but they do so indirectly it is also worth considering the most direct approach instituting price caps doing so would put pressure on programs to reduce their costs or find new ways to subsidize the price at the same time instituting price caps has significant potential for creating supply shortages or reductions in quality which must be addressed having the federal government explicitly dictate the price of higher education is a third rail but it is not unheard of in other policy areas having the federal government explicitly dictate the price of higher education is a third rail but it is not unheard of in other policy areas for example medicare has set payment rates for given procedures which can be adjusted based on other factors 32 this allows the government to use the fact that it is a major purchaser of health care services to negotiate more advantageous prices politics aside there are two computational challenges with a federal price control regime for colleges one is that in many cases an institution s listed price is not what is charged thanks to grants scholarships and tuition discounts thus a price cap could still allow out of pocket spending to rise if subsidies decline for example if a school lists its price of attendance as 40 000 per year but gives everyone a 20 000 grant students pay 20 000 if thanks to a price cap the school lowers its price to 25 000 but then eliminates the grants students end up paying more out of pocket than they did before accordingly any attempt to rein in prices would have to look at the net price the amount that a family pays out of pocket the one downside to this approach is that it could create some timing challenges because average net price will not be known until everyone has received their aid packages for the year the second issue is that the price of college is really two different items direct academic expenses for costs such as tuition fees books and supplies and living costs such as food housing and transportation the former is more squarely under the control of institutions although sometimes state legislatures set tuition rates for public colleges but the latter is not unless a school operates dormitories and cafeterias holding an institution accountable for capping the price of off campus living is not feasible given these challenges this section considers a narrower idea of a price cap unless explicitly noted all other references to the word price in this section refer to the net price for direct academic prices or living costs that the institution controls it also excludes elements of living costs that an institution might control such as dorms because all students might not use them the limited focus on academic expenses does create some challenges for effectiveness if a school keeps its price of attendance down but the price of housing in the area spikes a student will still face affordability challenges that are not the institution s fault a federal price control for higher education could be applied in varying levels of aggressiveness one would be akin to rent control a cap on the rate of price growth instead of dictating the overall price the government would require that any federally funded program not increase its price more than a set amount each year that level could be set at a fixed dollar amount or the change in the consumer price index doing so would acknowledge that cheaper programs may see larger percentage changes that represent smaller dollar increases alternatively the federal government could establish reference prices for different programs this is an idea borrowed from the health care space where the purchaser of health care services on behalf of enrollees will set a maximum price they are willing to pay for a given nonemergency procedure such as a hip replacement 33 these purchasers will then encourage patients to choose lower cost providers creating an incentive for those over the limit to bring their prices down as well patients can still select a provider over the reference price if they wish but they do so with a clear message that they will need to cover the amounts over that cap a reference price in higher education would need some modifications from the health care context in this scenario the government would set a maximum dollar amount of loans it would provide for different types of programs but it would need additional protections so that institutions cannot just cover amounts over the reference price through private or institutional loans to address that concern the federal government could either prohibit the institution from certifying any institutional or private loan for amounts over the reference price or it could remove lender protections for debt amounts above the cap such as prohibiting forced collections of those loans and making them dischargeable in bankruptcy with no waiting period this approach thus allows for out of pocket spending and some reasonable levels of debt but not other ways to make students pay more in the future regardless of the option chosen any price cap program will face several challenges beyond the issues of politics and optics one is what to do about institutions or programs that simply cannot afford to operate under these caps it s highly likely that these might be lower resourced colleges some of which could serve larger numbers of students of color 34 that creates some risk that these programs might close denying access and raising concerns about equity this could be even more problematic if the program has good outcomes despite its higher price another risk is that an institution may respond to a price cap by redirecting subsidies from undergraduate to graduate education which may not be the best use of money a price cap also runs the risk of creating supply shortages or a degradation in quality if colleges heavily subsidize spots to meet the price cap then they might have to shrink enrollment significantly this could be a good thing if colleges are charging too much or creating an oversupply of graduates but it would be bad if a constrained supply results in fewer spots than are necessary or in a system of rationing that results in places disproportionately going to wealthy or white students alternatively a college could avoid rationing but simply lower the quality of a program to lower its operating cost a cheap program that is of low quality could arguably be worse than a program that is at least a little too expensive all of this means that any price cap would require a lot of upfront work to think through possible institutional responses and how to handle them tackle specific credentials the above policy ideas focus on broad solutions that could be applied across any range of credentials and program areas but if none of those ideas work then it may be worth pursuing options that target specific credentials doing so could eliminate hot spots of concern in some cases these credential based solutions could also help rectify issues that make other ideas such as loan or price caps unworkable because of fears about societal demand for degrees being mismatched with pay for jobs such as teachers or social workers given these considerations this section contains recommendations for six types of credentials that are common across graduate school two teaching and social work are for fields where credentials are often required by law or expected by employers but which have lower returns than many other careers that demand graduate degrees three others law medicine and dentistry are for fields which are the most common examples of high debt but which generally lead to high salaries these five credentials represent about 22 percent of graduate borrowers with federal student loans the final is doctoral degrees for research and scholarship which represent about 9 percent of all federal graduate borrowers this is a category created by the national center for education statistics that includes almost all doctorate of philosophy doctorate of education and doctorate of science or engineering degrees as well as 60 percent of doctorate of psychology degrees and 75 percent of doctorate of business or public administration degrees 35 it is contrasted with professionally oriented credentials in law medicine theology dentistry chiropractic and pharmacy among others although doctoral students in research and scholarship areas often receive some funding from their institution they also can take a long time to complete and often lead to modest paying careers in fields such as the liberal arts meaning that they have the potential to generate unaffordable debt table 4 provides more information on the borrowing rate and debt levels of students in these programs the general idea behind the following recommendations is to move away from a system that tries to make these credentials affordable through back end repayment options and loan forgiveness to a system with reasonable operating costs and prices charged upfront providing benefits upfront would help aspiring graduate students understand exactly what they are getting into dealing with issues of price and the number of slots in some programs could also be a way to improve equity in programs that fail to enroll large numbers of low income students or students of color by making prices seem less formidable and engaging in intentional recruitment strategies an upfront approach would also make it easier to attract people to serve in roles where there are national shortages such as rural doctors or lawyers by setting aside spots for individuals who will commit to this kind of service admittedly these ideas will not solve every issue with graduate schools they do not touch terminal master s degrees such as a master s in business administration that appear to be a source of profit for schools with undetermined value for students but they are a starting point to address some of the highest debt fields teacher and social work master s degrees required affordable options about 14 percent of graduate borrowers are pursuing a master s of education teaching or social work in both education and social work it is not uncommon for employment or pay raises to require a master s degree yet in both cases the compensation that the professional receives in return may not be enough to easily pay down their debt this report does not weigh in on whether such degrees should be required except to note that there is a need for multiple pathways into the teaching profession but in cases where these credentials are either a necessity or provide a guaranteed income boost there should be requirements for the provision of affordable high quality options that do not cannibalize the full economic boost that the borrower receives regarding teacher training states must step up to the plate and ensure that programs at public colleges are both of high quality and affordable the former should entail ensuring that teacher credentials impart the skills and knowledge that make teachers more effective in the classroom this can include extended clinical practice particularly for alternative certification master s degrees and increased emphasis on coaching or mentoring content and pedagogical knowledge once states have ensured that teachers credentials are of high quality they must also work to make them affordable once states have ensured that teachers credentials are of high quality they must also work to make them affordable in cases where a master s degree is required for certification or licensure by states or districts the state would have to commit to providing high quality in person options for all teachers or social workers that can be repaid by a reasonable share of their salary over a defined period of time ideally one shorter than the 10 years it takes borrowers to receive public service loan forgiveness states could choose whether to provide these options at public or private colleges and how many offerings they would need given the geographic dispersal of students states should still aim for affordable repayment goals if the credential is not required for employment but tied to a guaranteed pay raise in that case however it would be reasonable for borrowers to either pay more or for longer since the credential is somewhat voluntary ideally states would address this challenge by lowering the price of their degrees upfront because that would create the least amount of additional implementation work on the backend and ensure that students will not be scared away by higher prices this would also avoid confusion about how post school assistance might interact with federal idr plans if states want to ensure that degrees are affordable through forgiveness plans or repayment benefits they must make sure that they do not add lots of complicated eligibility criteria or take other steps that could save money by making most students unable to get relief medical and dental school greatly expand the national health service corps roughly 4 percent of graduate borrowers are pursuing a degree in medicine or dentistry but these programs are also extremely important for filling national needs and these degrees typically have the largest debt balances in higher education there are a few key issues worth tackling around medical education and the associated profession one is that these programs must do more to enroll a diverse student population 36 another is that doctors are too often drawn to high paying specialties resulting in shortages of primary care physicians especially in rural areas 37 there is an estimated need for more than 13 000 more primary care physicians and the association of american medical colleges speculates that the need could triple by the 2030s 38 even if medical schools grow or become more diverse projected shortages of residency spots may also become a challenge in addressing doctor supply while reforming medical education financing alone may not be enough to solve these challenges some changes may help one would be to greatly expand programs that provide upfront subsidized medical school training for example congress could greatly expand the scholarship component of the national health services corps nhsc this is a program run by the u s department of health and human services that covers up to four years of academic expenses plus a support stipend at medical school or dental school in exchange for service in an area with a shortage of health service professionals including rural and urban areas 39 students must serve at least two years for the first year of scholarship money received with the requirement increasing by one year for each additional year of funding the overall service requirement is capped at four years greater funding could close the gap in the number of students served by the nhsc scholarship compared with its various loan repayment options these repayment options include programs that repay up to 50 000 of loans per year for the first two years of a service requirement plus additional amounts after and another of up to 120 000 for students in their last year of medical school 40 there are about 200 scholarship awards each year compared with roughly 5 000 loan repayment agreements 41 and only about 10 percent of applicants receive scholarships 42 expanding the nhsc would also entail addressing how it is funded the nhsc is currently funded through the discretionary appropriations process that means congress must choose to spend money on the program each year and funding for it must compete with all other priorities in the bill that funds labor health and education programs a system that makes it hard to secure sustained increases one downside to expanding the nhsc scholarship is that it has punitive terms for participants who do not fulfill their service requirement they must pay back an amount equal to three times what the government paid on their behalf minus some adjustments for portions of the service requirement they met 43 this raises some potential worries because other federal grants that convert into loans if requirements are not met can end up being a nightmare for participants to sort through 44 expanding the nhsc should also come with greater emphasis on funding spots for students who may not traditionally have as common a presence in medical schools this could mean placing a greater emphasis on the existing priority for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds in awarding funds 45
economic growth inflation and interest rates around the globe remain significantly lower than they were prior to the 2008 global financial crisis the limited success of efforts to stimulate the economy over the last 12 years are reminiscent of the japanese economy s stagnation during the 1990s are other developed economies including new zealand at risk of suffering the same malaise as japan over the medium term there s a little bit of japan in all of us it s january 1990 in tokyo the nikkei stock index has just completed its ninth straight year of real gains having risen 369 over and above inflation since its close at the end of 1980 the rise in property prices has been sustained for even longer although the 65 real increase in house prices over the previous 12 years pales in comparison against the share market s performance economic growth since 1975 has averaged 4 5 pa and unemployment is virtually non existent at 2 2 of course the stagnation of japan s previously high growth economy is now legendary since 1990 the country s economic growth has averaged just 1 0 pa house prices are still down 38 from the peak they reached in early 1991 and the share market is also languishing at about 60 of its 1989 closing level it s worthwhile recalling some of the contributing factors to japan s failure to recover from its economic downturn the bank of japan s monetary policy response was ineffective with the bank initially raising rather than cutting interest rates in response to the crisis even when the bank cut interest rates the speed at which monetary conditions were eased was not enough to stop deflation setting in the government s fiscal stimulus consisted of pork barrel policies handing out funds to vested interests and politically supportive businesses government debt ballooned but the moves failed to generate a pick up in economic growth population growth was slowing and the aging population became increasingly worried about its retirement prospects given the loss of wealth in the property and share markets these concerns were added to by soaring government debt leading to doubts about the government s ability to pay superannuation which intensified the drop off in spending as households concentrated on saving instead large parts of the business community were focused on survival rather than dynamic change and resource reallocation thereby undermining growth in productivity and gdp many of these factors have an air of familiarity about them when we consider the performance of other developed economies since the global financial crisis gfc to be fair nowhere has the response to the gfc been anywhere near as muddled or ineffective as japan s economic policies of the 1990s but it s still difficult to shake the nagging feeling that japan s long slow demise could be a forerunner of what we re currently seeing in other parts of the world the following set of charts compares the evolution of several variables in japan between 1989 and 2001 against the same variables in other developed economies over the 12 years since the gfc we also show where each of the indicators now sits for japan 30 years after its bubble burst reduced scope for monetary policy assistance chart 1 shows the gulf between 90 day bill rates before the crisis and more than a decade later for japan it s important to note that the central bank continued to raise interest rates throughout 1990 despite the stock market s crash because house prices were still climbing and the bank was concerned about inflation it was more than five years after the downturn started before short term interest rates in japan got below 1 this flawed response from the bank of japan in the 1990s contrasts with the substantial interest rate cuts and quantitative easing measures implemented by central banks following the gfc of 2008 nevertheless 12 years later interest rates remain at historically low levels leaving limited leverage for central banks ahead of any future slowdowns in economic growth in simple terms monetary policy has not been as successful at stimulating economic growth or inflation since the gfc as might have been hoped preventing interest rates from returning to normal levels indeed from japan s perspective the gfc kneecapped promising signs of some recovery in its economy and the bank of japan had very limited scope to ease monetary conditions to mitigate the downturn inflation goes awol the onset of deflation in japan by 1995 meant that any recovery for the economy became that much harder to generate households were already firmly in a saving mindset given the loss of wealth from the stock and property market collapses backed up by concerns that the government wouldn t be able to provide for their retirement as its debt levels soared falling prices simply gave consumers another reason not to spend today knowing that goods and services were likely to be cheaper tomorrow chart 2 shows that other countries have been successful in avoiding deflation since the gfc nevertheless price pressures have generally held below average despite the monetary and fiscal stimulus that has taken place this outcome seems to be largely due to downward pressure on prices caused by production efficiencies in china certainly within new zealand businesses have been complaining about the squeeze on profits and inability to put prices up given competitive pressures however it is likely that stronger demand growth globally over the last decade would have put more upward pressure on prices than we have seen in this respect inflation remains uncomfortably weak particularly given how low interest rates are and growth is a pale imitation chart 3 shows the drop off in japan s gdp growth after 1989 but it also demonstrates that american and european economies have suffered a significant slowdown in average growth since the gfc in comparison new zealand and australia have got off reasonably lightly the inexorably aging population the relative outperformance of new zealand and australia since the gfc appears to have been at least partly driven by population growth high net migration has been a prominent feature of new zealand s economic growth in recent years while australia s population growth remains relatively strong at 1 6 pa see chart 4 for japan the reluctance of households to spend has been exacerbated by its aging population and over the last decade the fact that the population has been shrinking the dampening effects of a contracting population on business activity will be well understood by businesses located in new zealand s provincial areas that have struggled to maintain their population base over the last 35 years japan is experiencing that phenomenon on a nationwide scale perhaps most critically for japan population growth peaked in 1972 and has been slowing ever since see chart 5 during the 1980s this trend was at odds with the country s housing boom and laid the foundation for the subsequent correction in property prices at least in new zealand the strength of population growth in recent years provides some justification for the surge in house prices over the next 15 20 years we note that population growth is expected to continue easing throughout the developed world unless there is an acceleration in per capita growth rates this trend implies that aggregate gdp growth will also slow over the medium term how much government debt is too much it s important to note that in the wake of the gfc no government was as negligent in its spending as japan s government during the 1990s american and european governments attempts to shore up the banking system or stimulate economic activity weren t perfect but they were generally sensible and not unduly driven by hopes of political gain government debt in the us and europe might not be as big as japan s was in 2001 but the levels are still high and cannot be glossed over much like monetary policy there is arguably limited scope for fiscal stimulus in these countries to soften any future economic downturn indeed given the current very high levels of debt around the globe it is somewhat surprising that interest rates on government bonds are not at above average levels rather than at multi decade lows the moral hazard of avoiding recessions at any cost in our view long term interest rates are symptomatic of a broader problem that has developed with regard to monetary and fiscal policy over the last 10 20 years particularly since the gfc central banks and governments have become so scared of recessions that they will do anything in their power to avoid one yet the process of clearing out the dead wood during a recession and the subsequent reallocation of resources towards more productive activities is a fundamental part of a healthy well functioning dynamic economy one of japan s biggest problems during the 1990s was the propping up of zombie banks by the government these banks were not forced to call in their non performing loans from unprofitable companies who in turn kept hold of labour and capital resources that potentially could have been used more gainfully elsewhere currently in developed economies cheap credit is being backed up by a belief that any significant slowdown in the economy will be pre empted by monetary and or fiscal stimulus this environment has effectively created a moral hazard whereby at an aggregate level businesses implicitly expect they will be rescued by the government or central bank from more difficult economic conditions that would require hard decisions to be made the too big to fail mantra which pervaded the global banking system following the gfc now almost seems to apply at an economy wide level in new zealand the fine tuning approach of monetary policy means that we now seem scared to allow or we are unwilling to let economic growth slip below 2 pa in the short term this approach feels good it is certainly preferable to the pain caused by business failures redundancies and unemployment but it carries a risk that we build up more and more obstacles to achieving better growth outcomes over the medium term new zealand s economic position is nowhere near as bad as japan s was 20 years ago our government debt is low and our population is projected to continue increasing for many years but there are warning signs flashing at present and the prolonged surge in our housing and share markets raises some cause for concern in this regard we are not alone with many other developed economies facing similar issues the challenge for new zealand is to heed the warning signs now or we might find ourselves slowly slipping into economic irrelevancy as japan has done gareth kiernan is chief

strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans the notional amount of the swap is 400 million with a termination date in october 2025 under the terms of the swap the company receives a fixed

usd libor the company will receive net interest settlements which will be recorded as loan interest income if one month usd libor exceeds the fixed rate of interest in future periods the company will be required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and will record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans the company recorded loan interest income related to this swap transaction of 1 2 million and 3 1 million respectively in the three months and year ended december 31 2019 the company s net interest margin has been positively impacted by significant additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the fdic assisted transactions on an ongoing basis the company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools for each of the loan portfolios acquired the cash flow estimates increased during the current and prior periods presented below based on payment histories and reduced credit loss expectations this resulted in increased income that has been spread on a level yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools and therefore has decreased over time additional estimated cash flows reclassification of discounts from non accretable to accretable totaling approximately 1 9 million and 12 3 million were recorded in the three

million of interest income during 2020 in the first quarter of 2020 we will adopt the new accounting standard related to accounting for credit losses with the adoption of this standard there will be no more reclassification of discounts from non accretable to accretable subsequent to december 31 2019 all adjustments made prior to december 31 2019 will continue to be accreted to interest income

december 31 2018 and decreased eight basis points when compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the compression in our margin during the three months ended december 31 2019 was caused primarily by

salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits increased 3 0 million from the prior year this is primarily related to the salary and benefit items discussed above the company s efficiency ratio for the quarter ended december 31 2019 was 56 11 compared to 55 57 for the same quarter in 2018 the efficiency ratio for the year ended december 31 2019 was 54 48 compared to 56 41 for 2018 the higher efficiency ratio in the 2019 three month period was primarily due to an increase in non interest expense the decrease in the ratio for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income partially offset by a decrease in non interest income due to the gain on sale of certain branches and deposits in 2018 the company s ratio of non interest expense to average assets was 2 38 and 2 37 for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 respectively compared to 2 49 and 2 56 for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 respectively the decreases in the current three month and one year period ratios were primarily due to an increase in average assets in the 2019 periods compared to the 2018 periods average assets for the quarter ended december 31 2019 increased 343 7 million or 7 4 from the quarter ended december 31 2018 primarily due to increases in loans receivable and investment securities average assets for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 351 7 million or 7 8 from the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to increases in loans receivable and investment securities income taxes on december 22 2017 h r 1 originally known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tcj act was signed into law among other things the tcj act permanently lowered the corporate federal income tax rate to 21 from the prior maximum rate of 35 effective for tax years including or commencing january 1 2018 the company currently expects its effective tax rate combined federal and state to be approximately 17 0 to 18 5 in 2019 and future years mainly as a result of the tcj act for the three months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 the company s effective tax rate was 20 3 and 17 9 respectively for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 the company s effective tax rate was 18 3 and 18 1 respectively these effective rates were lower than the statutory federal tax rate of 21 due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and to tax exempt investments and tax exempt loans which reduced the company s effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the company s utilization of tax credits and the level of tax exempt investments and loans and the overall level of pre tax income the company s effective income tax rate is currently expected to continue to be less than the statutory rate due primarily to the factors noted above capital as of december 31 2019 total stockholders equity and common stockholders equity were each 603 1 million 12 0 of total assets equivalent to a book value of 42 29 per common share total stockholders equity and common stockholders equity at december 31 2018 were each 532 0

rate swap totaling 32 2 million and 9 6 million respectively this increase in unrealized gains primarily resulted from lower market interest rates which increased the fair value of the derivatives and

loan portfolio presentation available on the company s investor relations website under presentations provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes is sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors including but not limited to past loss experience current portfolio mix actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio economic conditions and internal as well as external reviews the levels of non performing assets potential problem loans loan loss provisions and net charge offs fluctuate from period to period and are difficult to predict weak economic conditions higher inflation or interest rates or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense management maintains various controls in an attempt to limit future losses such as a watch list of possible problem loans documented loan administration policies and loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size loan type delinquencies financial analysis on going correspondence with borrowers and problem loan work outs management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense if necessary to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level the provision for loan losses for the quarter ended december 31 2019 was 650 000 compared with 2 0 million for the quarter ended december 31 2018 the provision for loan losses for the year ended december 31 2019 was 6 2 million compared with 7 2 million for the year ended december 31 2018 at december 31 2019 and 2018 the allowance for loan losses was 40 3 million and 38 4 million respectively total net charge offs were 762 000 and 1 0 million for the three months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively during the quarter ended december 31 2019 428 000 of the 762 000 of net charge offs were in the consumer auto category total net charge offs were 4 3 million and 5 2 million for the year ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively during the year ended december 31 2019 2 9 million of the 4 3 million of net charge offs were in the consumer auto category in addition two unrelated commercial loan relationships were responsible for 560 000 of the total net charge offs during the year ended december 31 2019 in response to a more challenging consumer credit environment the company tightened its underwriting guidelines on automobile lending in the latter part of 2016 management took this step in an effort to improve credit quality in the portfolio and reduce delinquencies and charge offs this action also resulted in a lower level of origination volume and as such the outstanding balance of the company s automobile loans continued to decline in the year ended december 31 2019 we have seen and expect to continue to see more rapid reductions in the automobile loan outstanding balance as we determined in february 2019 to cease providing indirect lending services to automobile dealerships at december 31 2019 indirect automobile loans totaled approximately 110 million we expect this total balance will be largely paid off in the next two years general market conditions and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects contributed to the level of provisions and charge offs collateral and repayment evaluations of all assets categorized as potential problem loans non performing loans or foreclosed assets were completed with corresponding charge offs or reserve allocations made as appropriate in june 2017 the loss sharing agreements with the fdic for inter savings bank were terminated in april 2016 the loss sharing agreements with the fdic for team bank vantus bank and sun security bank were terminated loans acquired from the fdic related to valley bank did not have a loss sharing agreement all acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition date these loan pools are systematically reviewed by the company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy great southern bank portfolio with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes review of financial information collateral valuations and customer interaction to determine if additional reserves are warranted the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans excluding fdic acquired loans was 1 00 0 98 and 0 99 at december 31 2019 december 31 2018 and september 30 2019 respectively management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio at december 31 2019 based on recent reviews of the bank s loan portfolio and current economic conditions if economic conditions were to deteriorate or management s assessment of the loan portfolio were to change it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required thereby adversely affecting the company s future results of operations and financial condition asset quality former teambank vantus bank sun security bank interbank and valley bank non performing assets including foreclosed assets and potential problem loans are not included in the totals or in the discussion of non performing loans potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below these assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates and are accounted for in pools therefore these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans the performance of the loan pools acquired in each of the five transactions has been better than expectations as of the acquisition dates as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio changes in economic and market conditions and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances the level of non performing assets will fluctuate non performing assets excluding all fdic assisted acquired assets at december 31 2019 were 8 2 million a decrease of 3 6 million from 11 8 million at december 31 2018 and a decrease of 820 000 from 9 0 million at september 30 2019 non performing assets excluding all fdic assisted acquired assets as a

document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap these non gaap financial measures include core net interest income core net interest margin and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio we calculate core net interest income and core net interest margin by subtracting the impact of adjustments regarding changes in expected cash flows related to pools of loans we acquired through fdic assisted transactions from reported net interest income and net interest margin management believes that core net interest income and core net interest margin are useful in assessing the company s core performance and trends in light of the fluctuations that can occur related to updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the 2009 2011 2012 and 2014 fdic assisted transactions in calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets we subtract period end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations as it provides a method to assess management s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets which are subjective components of valuation facilitates the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers in addition management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance these non gaap financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on gaap financial measures because not all companies use the same calculation of non gaap measures this presentation

greenwash not president trump to world economic forum a julian simon moment by robert bradley jr january 22 2020 e must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse they are the heirs of yesterday s foolish fortune tellers and i have them and you have them and we all have them and they want to see us do badly they predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s mass starvation in the 70s and an end of oil in the 1990s these alarmists always demand the same thing absolute power to dominate transform and control every aspect of our lives we will never let radical socialists destroy our economy wreck our country or eradicate our liberty america will always be the proud strong and unyielding bastion of freedom trump january 21 2020 denunciation even shock came from the establishment media including the washington post trump drops a climate bomb and the los angeles times at davos trump rejects climate crisis the post called trump s speech a 30 minute campaign stunt albeit devoid of the familiar xenophobic demagoguery it reported robert habeck co leader of germany s greens suggested that trump had destroyed the whole concept of this year s forum by making a mockery of the threat of climate change and all the private sector efforts mobilized by the forum to tackle the challenge i hadn t expected much habeck told a small group of journalists but the speech was a disaster for the conference for the idea of the conference for the idea of multilateralism for the approach of klaus schwab cnn gave it the spin that this time the alarm the climate alarm is right trump s remarks underscored the chasm between his denialist view of climate change and the overwhelming scientific consensus driving the rest of the developed world to action speaking shortly after the teenage climate activist greta thunberg accused world leaders of not taking action trump rejected calls for urgent action and encouraged the world to instead embrace optimism the new york times trump and the teenager in comparison was more measured than the three above trump s remarks on us economic gains deregulation and energy at the congress centre in davos switzerland follow energy related paragraphs are colored it s an honor to address the distinguished members of this organization for the second time as president when i spoke at this forum two years ago i told you that we had launched the great american comeback today i m proud to declare that the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before we ve regained our stride we discovered our spirit and reawakened the powerful machinery of american enterprise america is thriving america is flourishing and yes america is winning again like never before when i took office three years ago america s economy was in a rather dismal state under the previous administration nearly 200 000 manufacturing jobs had vanished wages were flat or falling almost 5 million more americans had left the labor force than had gotten jobs and more than 10 million people had been added to the food stamp rolls the experts predicted a decade of very very slow growth or even maybe negative growth high unemployment and a dwindling workforce and very much a shrinking middle class millions of hardworking ordinary citizens felt neglected betrayed forgotten they were rapidly losing faith in the system before my presidency began the outlook for many nations was bleak top economists warned of a protracted worldwide recession the world bank lowered its projections for global growth to a number that nobody wanted to even think about pessimism had taken root deep in the minds of leading thinkers business leaders and policymakers yet despite all of the cynics i had never been more confident in america s future i knew we were on the verge of a profound economic resurgence if we did things right one that would generate a historic wave of investment wage growth and job creation i knew that if we unleashed the potential of our people if we cut taxes slashed regulations and we did that at a level that s never been done before in the history of our country in a short period of time fixed broken trade deals and fully tapped american energy that prosperity would come thundering back at a record speed and that is exactly what we did and that is exactly what happened since my election america has gained over 7 million jobs a number unthinkable i wouldn t say it i wouldn t talk about it but that was a number that i had in mind the projection was 2 million we did 7 more than three times the government s own projections the unemployment rate is now less than 3 4 and 5 percent and at 3 5 percent that s a number that is the lowest in more than 50 years the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with reasonably high rate for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we re concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy ever to exist we are lifting up americans of every race color religion and creed unemployment rates among african americans hispanic americans and asian americans have all reached record lows african american youth unemployment has reached the lowest it s ever been in the history of our country african american poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level since 1953 and women now comprise a majority of the american workforce that s for the first time workers wages are now growing faster than management wages earnings growth for the bottom 10 percent is outpacing the top 10 percent something that has not happened paychecks for high school graduates are rising faster than for college graduates young americans just entering the workforce are also sharing in america s extraordinary prosperity since i took office more than 2 million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5 percent annually a number that was unthinkable nobody would have ever thought it was possible three years ago a record number of americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working in the eight years before i took office over 300 000 working age people left the workforce in just three years in my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce ten million people have been lifted off welfare in less than three years celebrating the dignity of work is a fundamental pillar of our agenda this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 percent three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded the american dream is back bigger better and stronger than ever before no one is benefitting more than america s middle class we have created 1 2 million manufacturing and construction jobs a number also unthinkable after losing 60 000 factories under the previous two administrations hard to believe when you hear 60 000 factories america has now gained in a very short period of time 12 000 new factories under my administration and the number is going up rapidly we ll be beating the 60 000 number that we lost except these will be bigger newer and the latest years of economic stagnation have given way to a roaring geyser of opportunity u s stock markets have soared by more than 50 percent since my election adding more than 19 trillion to household wealth and boosting 401 k s pensions and college savings accounts for millions of hardworking families and these great numbers are many things and it s despite the fact that the fed has raised rates too fast and lowered them too slowly and even now as the united states is by far the strongest economic power in the world it s not even close it was going to be close but a lot of good things happened to us and some not so good things happened to certain other places and i see such tremendous potential for the future we have not even started because the numbers we re talking about are massive the time for skepticism is over people are flowing back into our country companies are coming back into our country many of you who i know are coming back in with your plants and your factories thank you very much america s newfound prosperity is undeniable unprecedented and unmatched anywhere in the world america achieved this stunning turnaround not by making minor changes to a handful of policies but by adopting a whole new approach centered entirely on the wellbeing of the american worker every decision we make on taxes trade regulation energy immigration education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday americans we are determined to create the highest standard of living that anyone can imagine and right now that s what we re doing for our workers he highest in the world and we re determined to ensure that the working and middle class reap the largest gains a nation s highest duty is to its own citizens honoring this truth is the only way to build faith and confidence in the market system only when governments put their own citizens first will people be fully invested in their national futures in the united states we are building an economy that works for everyone restoring the bonds of love and loyalty that unite citizens and powers nations today i hold up the american model as an example to the world of a working system of free enterprise that will produce the most benefits for the most people in the 21st century and beyond a pro worker pro citizen pro family agenda demonstrates how a nation can thrive when its communities its companies its government and its people work together for the good of the whole nation as part of this new vision we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in american history we doubled the child tax credit benefitting 40 million american families and lifting 650 000 single mothers and their 1 million children out of poverty and out of poverty quickly we re removing roadblocks to success and rewarding businesses that invest in workers families and communities we ve also launched the most ambitious campaign in history to reduce job killing regulations for every new regulation adopted we are removing eight old regulations which will save an average of american households about 3 100 per year it was going to be for every one we do two but we were able to lift that to eight and we think that s going to go quite a bit higher we still have a way to go today i urge other nations to follow our example and liberate your citizens from the crushing weight of bureaucracy with that you have to run your own countries the way you want we re also restoring the constitutional rule of law in america which is essential to our economy our liberty and our future as a result of our efforts investment is pouring into our country in the first half of 2019 the united states attracted nearly one quarter of all foreign direct investment in the world think of that twenty five percent of all foreign investment all over the world came into the united states and that number is increasing rapidly to every business looking for a place where they are free to invest build thrive innovate and succeed there is no better place on earth than the united states e to protect our security and our economy we are also boldly embracing american energy independence the united states is now by far the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far it s not even close while many european countries struggle with crippling energy costs the american energy revolution is saving american families 2 500 every year in lowering electric bills and numbers that people said couldn t happen and also very importantly prices at the pump we ve been so successful that the united states no longer needs to import energy from hostile nations with an abundance of american natural gas now available our european allies no longer have to be vulnerable to unfriendly energy suppliers either we urge our friends in europe to use america s vast supply and achieve true energy security with u s companies and researchers leading the way we are on the threshold of virtually unlimited reserves of energy including from traditional fuels lng clean coal next generation nuclear power and gas hydrate technologies at the same time i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years we re committed to conserving the majesty of god s creation and the natural beauty of our world today i m pleased to announce the united states will join one trillion trees initiative being launched here at the world economic forum one trillion trees and in doing so we will continue to show strong leadership in restoring growing and better managing our trees and our forests this is not a time for pessimism this is a time for optimism fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action but to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse they are the heirs of yesterday s foolish fortune tellers and i have them and you have them and we all have them and they want to see us do badly but we don t let that happen they predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s mass starvation in the 70s and an end of oil in the 1990s these alarmists always demand the same thing absolute power to dominate transform and control every aspect of our lives we will never let radical socialists destroy our economy wreck our country or eradicate our liberty america will always be the proud strong and unyielding bastion of freedom in america we understand what the pessimists refuse to see that a growing and vibrant market economy focused on the future lifts the human spirit and excites creativity strong enough to overcome any challenge any challenge by far the great scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century from penicillin to high yield wheat to modern transportation and breakthrough vaccines have lifted living standards and saved billions of lives around the world and we re continuing to work on things that you ll be hearing about in the near future that even today sitting here right now you wouldn t believe it s possible that we have found the answers you ll be hearing about it but we have found answers to things that people said would not be possible certainly not in a very short period of time but the wonders of the last century will pale in comparison to what today s young innovators will achieve because they are doing things that nobody thought even feasible to begin we continue to embrace technology not to shun it when people are free to innovate millions will live longer happier healthier lives for three years now america has shown the world that the path to a prosperous future begins with putting workers first choosing growth and freeing entrepreneurs to bring their dreams to life so together we must go forward with confidence determination and vision we must not be timid or meek or fearful but instead we must boldly seize the day and embrace the moment we have so many great leaders in this room not only business leaders but leaders of nations and some are doing such a fantastic job we work together very closely we will draw strength from the glories of the past and we will make greatness our common mission for the future together we will make our nations stronger our countries safer our culture richer our people freer and the world more beautiful than ever before above all else we will forever be loyal to our workers our citizens and our families the men and women who are the backbone of our economies the heart of our communities and the soul of our countries let us bring light to their lives one by one and empower them to light up the world thank you very much god bless you god bless your countries and god bless america thank you thank you very much
sherryvsmith_images thinkstock the bank of canada is keeping its key interest rate target on hold at 1 75 and forecasting a slower than expected start for the canadian economy in 2020 in its latest forecast the central bank predicted the canadian economy will grow by 1 6 this year down 0 1 of a percentage point from its projection in october while some of the slowdown late last year is being chalked up to a strike at cn rail and an outage at the keystone pipeline the central bank says the weaker figures could also signal that global uncertainty is affecting canada more than previously predicted bank of canada governor stephen poloz said indicators of the canadian economy have turned decidedly mixed much of governing council s deliberations focused on how persistent this recent slowdown in the domestic economy might be he said poloz noted that vehicle sales retail sales more generally consumer confidence and job growth all softened at the end of last year however he said third quarter investment spending was surprisingly strong the bank of canada s outlook is for a rebound in growth to about 1 3 in the first quarter and a pickup to about 2 after that in making its rate decision poloz said the bank weighed the risk that inflation could fall short of target against the risk that a lower interest rates would lead to higher financial vulnerabilities governing council will be watching closely to see if the recent slowdown in growth is more persistent than forecast in assessing incoming data the bank will be paying particular attention to developments in consumer spending the housing market and business investment poloz said the picture the bank painted in its report wednesday was in sharp contrast from its last look at the economy when a degree of domestic resilience remained in spite of weaker data points outside canada s borders there is considerable uncertainty about how long household spending may stay soft the report said as households are expected to be more cautious with their spending decisions and save more in the face of high levels of debt all this despite a federal tax cut that kicked in on jan 1 and growth in wages the bank suggested weakness in the manufacturing sector and a tightening of provincial purse strings may have a dampening effect on the economy bank of montreal chief economist doug porter called it a dovish surprise from the bank of canada which he said had sounded generally sanguine in its outlook for the economy in recent weeks while we can all debate the merits of that view there is no debating that the bank has an easing bias and further significant disappointments on jobs and or spending could prompt them to act on that bias porter wrote in a report however porter said he believes that growth will bounce back more than the central bank is expecting the bank of canada said ratification of the new north american free trade deal a top priority for the trudeau liberals now that the u s and mexico have completed their processes and a partial trade detente between the united states and china should help stoke economic fires in canada growth for 2021 is forecast at 2 up from the bank s october forecast of 1 8 the outlook for the economy could change if the trump administration follows through on threats to slap tariffs on france brazil and argentina the report also cites as a risk ongoing tensions between the united states and iran which has already led to the tragic downing of a ukrainian passenger jet with canadians onboard an escalation could roil the middle east and likely increase the price of oil leading to higher gas prices across the country

items that build upon the slide you have in front of you unless otherwise stated percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation while not part of the prepared remarks for today s call we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2019 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models worldwide consumer segment sales totaled 3 6 billion growing 2 1 excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures adjusted operational sales growth was 1 4 with growth in the u s of 1 6 due primarily to strong performance in our otc franchise growth outside of the u s was 1 3 over the counter medicines grew globally almost 5 operationally and on an adjusted basis in the u s otc growth was around 10 and is growing share in multiple products such as adult tylenol driven by rapid release gels pepcid and zarbee s however u s growth was aided by about 200 basis points of stocking due to incremental distribution and trade promotion programs the beauty franchise grew 4 3 or just under 1 when adjusted to exclude the impact of the acquisition of dr ci labo and the roc divestiture neutrogena delivered strong performance globally with growth of 4 outside the u s driven by anti aging and cleansing innovation in emea as well as hand and body moisture category strength in the asia pacific region in the u s share and market growth were largely offset by lapping of prior year new product pipeline builds and higher 2019 trade investment in neutrogena concluding the consumer segment baby care declined 9 3 globally or negative 7 when adjusted to exclude the impact of the baby center divestiture this decline was primarily due to continued competitive pressures as well as comparisons to prior year relaunch activities most notably in the united states moving on to our pharmaceutical segment worldwide pharmaceutical sales of 10 5 billion grew 4 4 enabled by double digit growth in nine key products the segment delivered a seventh consecutive quarter above 10 billion in revenue sales grew in the u s about 4 and increased outside the u s by almost 5 generic competition for zytiga negatively impacted our worldwide and u s growth by about 180 basis points and 310 basis points respectively our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver global growth at above market levels despite significant biosimilar and generic headwinds our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of over 10 darzalex continued its strong performance growing about 45 globally the u s grew almost 38 with strong growth across all lines of therapy driven by the new frontline indication for the multiple myeloma transplant ineligible population the continued strong growth outside the u s is driven by increased penetration and share gains imbruvica grew over 26 globally driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth primarily in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia indication in the u s along with strong uptake outside the u s in the u s based on third quarter data imbruvica gained above 7 points of market share in cll line 1 therapy worldwide zytiga growth declined by about 13 with declines of almost 45 in the u s due to generic competition which was partially offset by continued strong growth of almost 13 outside the u s we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of erleada which generated global sales of 116 million in q4 and 332 million for the full year primarily in the united states we continue to grow market share in non metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer gaining over two points in the u s this quarter sales in the u s reflects the first full quarter for the approved indication for patients with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer we are also pleased with the launch progress in emea where erleada is now available in 12 countries our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of just over 6 driven by strong double digit performance of stelara and tremfya sales growth was partially offset by continued erosion of remicade of about 16 due to increased discounts and modest share loss in the u s to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars stelara growth of almost 19 was primarily driven by the crohn s disease indication where market share has increased by 6 points in the u s versus the fourth quarter of 2018 in october we received u s fda approval of stelara for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis simponi simponi aria delivered sales growth of 7 6 driven by strong market growth and simponi aria share gains in the u s tremfya grew over 55 and achieved an 8 3 share of the psoriasis market in the u s which is up about 2 points from the fourth quarter of 2018 in neuroscience our paliperidone long acting portfolio performed well growing 15 with higher market share driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency in addition we continue to progress the launch of spravato patient demand continues to build and the unmet need remains very high new patient starts continue to steadily increase each month with over 3 500 patients being treated to date further we are pleased to report that in december spravato was approved in europe for adults with treatment resistant major depressive disorder in infectious diseases our portfolio grew 9 6 led by strong growth of symtuza and juluca for hiv partially offset by cannibalization and increased generic competition in other products in our cardiovascular metabolism and other product portfolio we did experience declining sales of 9 5 primarily driven by declines in invokana and biosimilar competition for procrit xarelto was flat with volume increases offset by rebates primarily due to an increase in the legislative rate for the donut hole from 50 to 70 along with higher medicare and donut hole utilization in our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio sales declined 6 2 as a result of a distributor model change in the u s to realize efficiencies by leveraging our distribution capabilities this change negatively impacted sales growth by about 800 basis points with sales growth of 2 when adjusting for this one time impact we continue to see strong share growth for opsumit and uptravi and when adjusting for the one time distributor model impact their worldwide sales were about 10 and 30 respectively portfolio growth was also impacted by declining sales in tracleer as a result of continued generic competition i ll now turn your attention to the medical devices segment worldwide medical devices sales were 6 6 billion growing 0 2 excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures primarily the divestiture of asp adjusted operational sales growth was 2 7 worldwide one time items negatively impacted growth in the quarter by about 70 basis points largely related to a bleed down of the forward buying in q3 in japan ahead of the consumption tax change which primarily impacted our vision business the majority of this has sold through in q4 with the remainder expected to occur in q1 2020 additionally on a year on year basis we are pleased to report the medical devices has accelerated underlying sales growth worldwide by 130 basis points with the second half of 2019 delivering 4 growth interventional solutions grew over 13 globally led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business achieving about 14 growth worldwide and almost 16 for the year continuing its trend of double digit growth for the 11th consecutive year growth was strong in all regions driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth additionally our cerenovus business delivered its sixth straight quarter of double digit growth driven by strong market growth and new product innovation including embotrap for the treatment of ischemic stroke vision grew 0 9 or 3 when adjusting for the negative impact of the japan consumption tax forward buy i mentioned earlier growth was primarily driven by contact lenses which grew 2 6 globally or 5 adjusted for the bleed of the japan consumption tax forward buy led by double digit growth of daily disposables in the oasys family for the year contact lens grew almost 5 which we expect to be in line with the overall market representing the fourth consecutive year the contact lens has grown at or above the market in surgical vision we saw continued strong ous growth in the cataract business due to above market performance in iols primarily in asia pacific this was offset by weak u s performance due to competitive pressures and lower market growth in refractive surgery we continue to see positive momentum in orthopaedics delivering growth for the quarter of 1 2 on an annual basis each major platform accelerated versus the prior year and adjusted growth for this franchise improved by 180 basis points this progress reflects the continued execution of our innovation and commercial strategies aimed to improve performance hips grew 4 2 driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach continued strong demand of our primary stem actis and enabling technologies such as the kincise surgical automated system and jointpoint navigation system knees growth was 1 4 in the quarter driven by strong performance of new innovation such as attune revision attune s plus i mean the attune cementless rotating platform which launched at the end of q3 ous growth of 3 2 was led by asia pacific additionally the united states returned to growth this quarter trauma growth of 2 5 globally was driven by market growth supported by strong adoption of newer innovation such as our femoral neck system spine declined 5 8 with the u s being the primary driver partially due to not repeating a time q4 2018 favorable pricing related true up which negatively impacted global growth by 250 basis points excluding this impact performance for the quarter was in line with the full year while we lost share in the quarter we continue to see positive uptake of newer products and are pleased with the strong start of our newly launched symphony surgical system for use in posterior cervical spine procedures pricing pressure continue to impact all categories in orthopedics u s pure price in spine declined about 3 after adjusting for last year s pricing related true up trauma price was consistent with the q3 decline of 2 price in hips and knees both improved compared to q3 at negative 1 and flat respectively moving to the results for the surgery business advanced surgery delivered global growth of over 3 led by bio surgery growth of about 4 with growth in all regions led by asia pacific share gains and market growth however growth in the quarter was tempered as surgiflo continued to ramp back up in the united states energy and endocutters grew approximately 3 and 2 respectively with ous growth driven by share gains and new products in the asia pacific region partially offset by competitive pressure in the united states wound closure grew over 2 driven by continued strong market growth in china as well as share gains in conventional and barbed sutures as expected selling days had an immaterial impact on our global growth rates in the fourth quarter in 2020 selling days will negatively impact q1 medical devices growth by over 50 basis points with the majority being offset in q2 i will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the year please direct your attention to the box section at the bottom of the schedule you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items as reported this morning our adjusted eps of 8 68 reflects reported growth of 6 1 and operational growth of 8 8 exceeding the high end of both our reported an operational adjusted eps guidance range from october driven by our strong performance consistent with our guidance we did see a slight decline in adjusted pre tax operating margins of 30 basis points driven by investment in digital surgery and medical devices moving to the next slide our full year 2019 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 170 basis points versus 2018 looking at the adjusted pre tax income by segment medical devices at 35 4 is higher than the previous year primarily due to increased divestiture gains in 2019 partially offset by an increase in investments in digital surgery pharmaceutical margins declined by 200 basis points to 40 driven by reduced divestiture gains and higher cost of products sold due to the negative impact of currency consumer margins improved by 90 basis points to 21 4 driven by planned prioritization and spending reductions partially offset by reduced divestiture gains in 2018 now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule as referenced in the table of non gaap measures the 2019 fourth quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of 1 billion on an after tax basis primarily driven by intangible amortization of 1 billion excluding the impact of those items our adjusted earnings per share is 1 88 a decrease of 4 6 versus the fourth quarter 2018 adjusted eps on a constant currency basis was 1 91 down 3 versus fourth quarter 2018 i like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year cost of products sold delevered slightly primarily driven by an increase in amortization expense partially offset by favorable segment mix selling marketing and administrative margins for the quarter improved as a result of planned prioritization in the consumer business and favorable segment mix partially offset by increased investment in the medical devices business r d investment was consistent year over year with slightly lower milestone payments in the pharmaceutical business offset by increased investment in digital solutions in the medical device business net interest expense was lower by 50 million primarily driven by the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements partially offset by reduced interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on cash balances the change in the other income and expense line was primarily driven by lower litigation expense higher unrealized gains on securities partially offset by lower gains from divestitures regarding taxes in the quarter our effective tax rate was 4 9 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 tax rate of 2 6 the current quarter includes an estimated tax expense for the transition provisions of swiss tax reform partially offset by reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries and additional impacts of recently issued regulations associated with u s tax reform we encourage you to reference our 10 k for further details on this and other specific tax matters excluding special items the effective tax rate was 10 7 relatively consistent with the same period last year which was 11 1 now looking at adjusted income before tax in the fourth quarter of 2019 our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 29 6 to 27 1 in the fourth quarter of 2019 primarily driven by the impact of divestiture gains in q4 of last year the following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment medical devices declined by 830 basis points driven by the lifescan divestiture gain reported in q4 2018 as well as an increased investment in robotics and digital solutions in 2019 consumer margins declined by 280 basis points primarily driven by the divestiture of roc in q4 2018 the slight increase in pharmaceutical margins of 30 basis points was primarily driven by reduced milestone payments that concludes the sales and p l highlights for johnson johnson s fourth quarter 2019 for your reference here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter some of which were mentioned in my comments i m now pleased to turn the call over to alex gorsky alex gorsky chairman board of directors and chief executive officer thank you chris and thanks to all of you for joining us today we re very pleased to be highlighting our fourth quarter and full year performance we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth in 2019 exceeding the financial performance metrics that we set at the beginning of the year

challenges from debates about the healthcare system in our country to uncertainty with global trade to today s litigious environment to name a few now i m very proud that despite the challenges we still remain focused and delivered on our credo commitments and responsibilities to our patients employees communities and shareholders ultimately driving our purpose to advance health for humanity

opportunity to compete and in the markets where we lead which include our 26 platforms that each deliver 1 billion or more in sales annually in pharmaceuticals our strong track record of success continued again in 2019 as our pharma segment outpaced the market growing operationally 5 8 which more than offset the loss of exclusivity due to biosimilar competition and generic erosion as well as new competitive entrants and other market pressures now it s important to note that our robust growth can be attributed to volume not price and our sales growth is a reflection of the increased number of patients we re reaching with our transformational medicines for unmet needs this strong growth not only enabled us to deliver life saving and life changing medicines to people around the globe but it also enabled us to become the third largest pharmaceutical company in the world retain our number 1 leadership position in the u s and be recognized as the number 1 pharmaceutical company on fortune magazine s annual most admired companies list our pharma investments in r d continue to fuel exceptional growth as well we achieved double digit growth for 10 key products and delivered strong performance across all regions including in both developed and emerging markets we re very proud and excited that we gained approval and launched two new transformational medicines spravato for treatment resistant depression and balversa for metastatic urothelial cancer we also continue to maximize the value in our market brands submitting numerous filings and receiving approvals for line extensions for key brands including stelara darzalex and erleada many with peak sales potential that is greater than 500 million and we continue to expand our portfolio of strategic licensing and acquisition of new assets and platforms including cusatuzumab from argenx an investigational antibody for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and high risk myelodysplastic syndromes a gene regulation platform from meiragtx and bermekimab from xbiotech inc an anti il 1 alpha in phase ii development to treat atopic dermatitis and hidradenitis suppurativa with this industry leading pipeline our commercial capabilities and robust r d productivity i m confident that we are well positioned to continue delivering sustained long term above market growth in 2020 and beyond now 2019 marked a year of significant transformation for the consumer health business we reestablished our brand and purpose and made strategic decisions that over time will accelerate growth reduce complexity and improve operating margins fueled by science based professionally endorsed brands and strong consumer insights we placed a concerted focus throughout 2019 on establishing a clear plan and path to achieve benchmark profitability in 2020 and this segment is already well on its way delivering 90 basis points of adjusted pre tax margin improvement for the year additionally we successfully integrated the acquisitions of zarbee s inc a leader in naturally based over the counter remedies and the dr ci labo line of dermocosmetic skin care products strengthening our position in these higher growth categories our u s consumer business continues to grow above the market and our priority areas of beauty and otc delivered solid operational growth for the year i m also pleased to share that medical devices accelerated growth again in 2019 as a result of our relentless focus on execution innovation and portfolio management our underlying growth was just under 4 now improved performance was driven by electrophysiology achieving its 11th consecutive year of double digit growth contact lens which delivered growth at or above the market for the fourth straight year energy and endocutters businesses growing mid single digits and improved performance in orthopedics with each major platform accelerating compared to 2018 during the year we also fortified our commitment and accelerated our entry into one of the fastest growing healthcare categories and exciting transformative fields of medicine digital surgery consistent with our historical pioneering spirit in medical devices we are focused on the next frontier of surgery the acquisition of auris health inc a developer of robotic technologies currently in lung cancer accelerated our entry into robotics as part of a digital surgery ecosystem designed to make medical intervention smarter less invasive and more personalized to elevate the standard of care additionally just last month we announced an agreement to acquire the remaining stake in verb surgical to further strengthen our ecosystem and we also successfully launched critical products across each franchise throughout 2019 including the attune cementless knee system our first of its kind acuvue oasys contact lens with transitions light intelligent technology the industry s first powered circular stapler echelon and the vizigo steerable sheath in our market leading electrophysiology business our team continues to focus on improving our cadence of innovation as well as our portfolio optimization which included the completion of the advanced sterilization products divestiture and the execution of more than 50 acquisitions or strategic partnerships that we expect will further augment our future growth we are committed to building upon this momentum in 2020 and i m pleased to share that we will be hosting our medical device business review day on may 13th to highlight the strategies that we believe will drive further growth and provide additional insights into the team s plans in digital surgery looking ahead across all three business segments we know we ve got more work to do but we are committed to continuing to deliver above market growth in our pharmaceutical business broadening the reach of our consumer business and meeting the full potential of our medical devices business and one of the most critical factors in achieving the goals of all of our business strategies is sustaining our investment in innovation once again in 2019 we achieved record levels of investment investing more than 11 billion in research and development and across all industries we remain one of the top 10 global companies that invest at the highest levels in r d and innovation across johnson johnson we recognize the powerful impact that technology innovation and health breakthroughs have in creating meaningful change in people s lives and establishing a competitive differentiation within the industry now i would be remiss if i did not acknowledge that all of these many accomplishments would not have been possible without the efforts passion and engagement of our approximately 132 000 global johnson johnson colleagues who continue to demonstrate a commitment to delivering healthcare solutions that benefit patients consumers and communities around the world our purpose driven credo based culture puts patients and people first and this is certainly true in the way we think about our employees and work to consistently cultivate the world s best healthiest and most engaged workforce the fact that our johnson johnson colleagues are truly the driving force behind our successful performance and in fulfilling our purpose is something that we never never take for granted and always celebrate we share the common objective of always making the health and well being of the patients and consumers who use our products every day our number one priority and it has been this way for the last 134 years we are on the front lines of developing medicines and revolutionary products that are literally saving people s lives and we re working to prevent cancer offer less invasive surgeries and to end ebola and hiv this is what the world expects of us and this is what our global workforce is united around committed to and prepared to do now putting the needs of those we serve first also means protecting our shared environment in natural resources we know that human health is directly linked to the health of the planet healthy people and communities go hand in hand with a healthy environment this is why we are committed to reducing the environmental footprint of our operations products and supply chain with 2020 targets to reduce carbon emissions by 20 and procure 35 of electricity from renewable resources looking over the long term we are optimizing our operations to improve water and energy efficiency while focusing on sustainable design and reduction in product packaging as well all with the goal of delivering better health for people everywhere so now i d like to close where i began in spite of the numerous industry challenges we faced throughout 2019 i m very pleased that we remain focused on

why we are so very excited and confident about 2020 and beyond i look forward to addressing your questions during the upcoming q a but i ll now turn it over to joe who will provide additional details about our results and guidance for 2020 thank you joe joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer thank you alex hello everyone we appreciate you joining today s call i will be providing additional context around our 2019 performance including our year end cash position and the capital allocation actions that we executed throughout the year and then conclude with our guidance for 2020 as alex and chris mentioned we delivered solid fourth quarter results which capped a strong year of performance for johnson johnson our full year results reflect a continued commitment to our long term strategic objectives throughout the quarter and the year we maintained our focus on delivering life saving and life changing products to patients and consumers across the globe heading into 2020 we are confident in our overall strategy and ability to drive results across the enterprise that will yield strong shareholder returns our solid results during the year generated strong cash flow our highest level ever of free cash flow of nearly 20 billion with respect to our cash position at the end of 2019 we had approximately 8 4 billion of net debt consisting of approximately 19 3 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately 27 7 billion of debt although we don t provide cash flow guidance for transparency as we come off a record year of free cash flow generation we do expect a decline in 2020 of approximately 10 as we are planning for a payment related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation as previously disclosed in 2019 we executed on all four elements of our capital allocation strategy our first objective within that framework is to invest in growth opportunities to solidify and advance our current business delivering transformative healthcare solutions and creating access is the top priority for johnson johnson and as alex mentioned we invested more than 11 billion in r d during 2019 as investors in johnson johnson know delivering a competitive and increasing dividend is a capital allocation priority for us in 2019 we returned almost 10 billion to investors which is approximately 50 of our free cash flow increasing the quarterly dividend by 5 6 once we ve satisfied our dividend objectives we seek m a opportunities where our capabilities can create compelling value during the year we completed a number of strategic acquisitions totaling almost 6 billion to further strengthen our portfolio which alex outlined earlier in the call finally after executing on these three important capital allocation priorities we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as the 5 billion share repurchase program we began in december of 2018 and concluded in the third quarter of 2019 let s move the discussion to guidance and information to assist your financial modeling for the year ahead i ll begin with some qualitative comments that we considered in our outlook first our projected sales growth includes the benefit of an additional two to three shipping days associated with a 53rd week in our 2020 fiscal calendar this will be partially offset by a sku rationalization program in our consumer segment as part of our efforts to further improve profitability in 2020 the consumer segment will continue to invest in platforms where we have differentiated brands with the greatest potential therefore we plan to rationalize approximately 10 of the skus across the global portfolio translating to a negative impact on 2020 topline growth of slightly over 100 basis points for the segment this program will be primarily focused outside the u s with a larger impact coming in the second half of the year in the baby and beauty franchises considering both the additional shipping days associated with a 53rd fiscal week and the consumer sku rationalization program the net impact is approximately 50 basis points to 100 basis points of benefit to the company s sales growth outlook specific to each segment our adjusted sales guidance also assumes continued above market performance in our pharmaceutical segment driven by continued strong growth from key products such as darzalex imbruvica tremfya stelara and erleada due to increased penetration and new indications continued acceleration of sales growth in medical devices generated by recent launches and improved execution and in the consumer health business we will continue to grow above the market in the u s while executing the sku rationalization program to position the segment for benchmark profitability given these factors we expect adjusted operational sales growth for the full year of between 5 and 6 or 5 5 at the midpoint the adjusted operational sales growth of 5 to 6 is on a constant currency basis reflecting how we manage our business performance considering a negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures which we estimate at 50 basis points we are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth in the range of 4 5 to 5 5 or 85 8 billion to 86 6 billion as you know we do not predict the impact of currency movements but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the u s dollar as of last week at 1 11 there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 50 basis points resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 4 and 5 compared to 2019 or 85 4 billion to 86 2 billion let s now discuss earnings per share as you can see on your screen here s a slide depicting the components and assumptions included in our 2020 eps guidance using the sales growth guidance i just referenced provides approximately 0 40 growth to eps the next column is based on expected operating margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points which translates to an incremental 0 25 of contribution net of continued investments across our segments operating margin improvement will be primarily driven by continued efforts to improve manufacturing capabilities optimize sales marketing and administrative expenses and the consumer sku rationalization just discussed this results in strong adjusted operational eps growth for the core business of 0 65 or 7 5 versus the prior year offsetting those two operating components is the anticipated reduced level of other income of approximately 0 30 compared to 2019 you may recall that we benefited from a large divestiture gain from the sale of our advanced sterilization products business in the second quarter of 2019 the final element to this eps waterfall chart is the 2020 benefit we will have from the share repurchase program completed in 2019 which adds 0 05 to eps compared to 2019 resulting in an adjusted operational eps of 9 08 at the midpoint or a growth rate of 4 6 while not predicting the impact of currency movements using recent exchange rates our reported adjusted eps would be negatively impacted by approximately 0 05 per share resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share of 9 03 at the midpoint reflecting growth of approximately 4 continuing with eps guidance this slide provides a summary of additional p l items to better provide insight into our full year 2020 guidance as referenced earlier for 2020 we are expecting our adjusted pre tax operating margin to improve by approximately 100 basis points while still prioritizing investment in our business that accelerates and further strengthens our pipeline of new products for the long term although we are continuously evaluating external value creating opportunities for purposes of your models we currently assume no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash and are therefore comfortable with your modeling net interest expense between zero and 100 million as a reminder other income and expense is the line on the p l where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses related to the items such as litigation investments by our johnson johnson development corporation divestitures asset sales and write offs we would be comfortable with your models for 2020 reflecting net other income and expense excluding special items as net income ranging from 1 5 billion to 1 7 billion this is lower than 2019 as we had elevated levels of divestiture gains and we do not expect an event of that magnitude in 2020 moving on to taxes our effective tax rate guidance for 2020 excluding special items is approximately 17 5 to 18 5 were higher than where we ended 2019 driven by expected changes in the mix of global earnings and miscellaneous one time benefits not expected to reoccur in 2020 considering all these factors we are comfortable with adjusted eps guidance in a range of 9 00 to 9 15 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 3 7 to 5 4 again while not predicting the impact of currency movements but to provide some insight on the potential impact on eps using exchange rates from last week our reported adjusted eps would be negatively impacted by approximately 0 05 per share therefore our estimate for 2020 reported adjusted eps is between a range of 8 95 to 9 10 per share or 9 03 per share at the midpoint as a final comment our guidance assumes no formal share repurchase program at this time i wanted to provide this reminder since the last time i looked street estimates utilized an average share count which is significantly lower than what we are assuming for our 2020 guidance we estimate the average diluted shares outstanding to be largely in line with the fourth quarter 2019 share count or 2 67 billion shares although we do not provide quarterly guidance there are a few factors for you to consider in your models beyond the selling day fluctuations chris mentioned in his remarks for medical device for sales you can expect the fourth quarter of 2020 to have the benefit of the additional shipping days partially offset by the consumer sku rationalization program that we are projecting throughout the year but more pronounced in the back half with respect to earnings the first quarter of 2019 included an equity gain related to the consumer acquisition of dr ci labo and the second quarter of 2019 included the gain associated with the asp divestiture in medical devices we don t anticipate similar events for other income and expense in the first half of 2020 but would expect elevated levels of other income aligned to today s guidance in the second half of 2020 lastly based on today s spot rates currency will have a more negative impact in the first half of 2020 that concludes prepared remarks of our financial summary of 2019 results and 2020 guidance our 2019 results reinforce our confidence in our broad based business as we head into 2020 and we look forward to delivering continued value on behalf of all stakeholders as alex mentioned we will be hosting our medical device business review day on may 13th and i look forward to seeing all of you in person at this exciting event which will be held in new york city this year for your planning purposes and based on investment community feedback please note that we will be highlighting our consumer segment at consumer focused events such as notable cpg conferences this year a special thank you to our johnson johnson associates around the world for their tireless efforts and commitment who make the results we have attained possible and the outlook so bright i will now turn the call back to chris to begin the q a christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations thank you joe we will now move to the q a portion of the webcast operator can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question questions and answers operator yes thank you your first question comes from chris schott with jpmorgan chris schott jpmorgan analyst great thanks very much for the questions the first was just on pharma can you just elaborate a little bit more on your expectations for growth in 2020 i guess specifically what are you expecting in terms of patent expirations headwinds for this year and can you also elaborate on the competitive dynamics you re expecting for both tremfya and stelara in psoriasis with the launch of skyrizi thanks so much christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations hey good morning chris and thanks for the question thanks for joining us today so with pharmaceuticals as i mentioned in some of my prepared remarks we do expect continued growth above the market i think as we would have sat here last year we expected a bigger impact in 2019 from the loss of exclusivity and generic and biosimilar competition to our products and to our teams credit based on the data the safety the efficacy the familiarity of the products and comfortability for physicians and patients those products were able to retain that business a little bit longer we would expect that to bleed into 2020 and but we still do even with that i ll call a neutralized headwinds it s not a tailwind per se but i ll call it a neutralized headwind compared to 2019 i think we do certainly expect that the portfolio of products will continue to outperform the general market of pharmaceuticals in general alex gorsky chairman board of directors and chief executive officer hey chris this is alex just to add one comment on to that look we re extremely proud overall of the performance of our pharmaceutical group but particularly our immunology group within pharma if you if you just step back a moment and look over the past several years at first of all the way that they were able to manage the biosimilar impact with remicade while simultaneously launching multiple new indications for compounds like stelara launching tremfya to note that tremfya 55 growth in the quarter stelara had 19 growth and frankly also it s the clinical development and the competitive differentiation with tremfya for example having comparative trials not only versus our own compounds but also against humira and cosentyx and i think what s really important is that in areas that these products are used it s not only the short term results but it s particularly important for the long term results so many patients on psoriasis will shift from product to product and are suffering from this condition for a long time and having in excess of 48 months worth of duration and treatment effect by a compound like tremfya i think really helps explain its uptake and continued confidence and use by physicians and patients in the marketplace so and we combine that with the penetration rate of probably somewhere in the 30 to 40 rate in this overall category we think that there is still a lot of unmet need we think that there is still a lot of opportunity with these compounds and that doesn t even include some of the additional clinical development programs that we re having in areas such as gi as well for these where particularly for a compound like stelara we re seeing great impact we think that there is a lot of opportunity ahead chris schott jpmorgan analyst great thanks for that maybe one other really quick one here other income 1 5 billion to 1 7 billion i think that s still a bit above your historic levels of other income i know this number can be a bit lumpy but should we think about this type of level as a new norm or can we think about that number of declining further as we look beyond 2020 thanks joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer yeah chris thanks for the question i would say it s certainly down from what we experienced in 2019 and i would expect not to provide any insight into 2021 just yet but i would expect that number to come further down as we look out so as you see this year we re improving our operating margins by nearly a 100 basis points to offset some of the effect that we had the benefit of in 2019 and i think we ll continue to do that but to be truthful we continually look and manage our portfolio in a very rigorous fashion making sure that we re the best owners of the assets that we have and that works both ways so we look to complement our portfolio but we ll also look to take underperforming businesses and create value for shareholders in other ways chris schott jpmorgan analyst thank you christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations chris thanks for your questions next question please operator your next question comes from larry biegelsen with wells fargo larry biegelsen wells fargo analyst good morning thanks for taking the question just one on the extra week and one of the litigation joe can you talk about the impact of the extra week in 2020 in 2015 it was about 4 in q4 1 for the full year and neutral to eps does it impact u s more than international does it impact some businesses more than other i heard your comments on consumer but i m thinking more about pharma and med tech and i had one follow up joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer yes so larry with respect to the fiscal 53rd week that translates to about two to three shipping days i would say that s pretty much the norm for the medical device and pharmaceutical units that you ve asked about it s a little bit less in consumer in terms of impact because it doesn t impact stocking during the holiday season so and you re absolutely correct we had the same assumptions around eps it s pretty much neutral because you still have a full week of expenses without really the benefit of a full week of sales larry biegelsen wells fargo analyst thanks for that and alex just one on litigation just what s the latest on the opioid litigation the latest on the 4 billion settlement you had previously announced any important dates and milestones we should think about and just lastly on talc when do you expect the decision from the daubert hearing thanks for taking the questions joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer hey larry this is joe i ll take that thanks for the questions with respect to the opioid settlement an agreement in principle that was announced shortly after our q3 earnings where we set aside 4 billion we continue to work with the negotiating committee of the state attorney generals to finalize the agreement in principle we remain i would say cautiously optimistic that that s progressing very well we re highly engaged to the extent we can be to finalize that agreement in principle and we hope to hear more over the coming months from the lead negotiators representing not just the states but as you know the counties and municipalities with respect to talc and the daubert litigation we are awaiting judge wolfson s verdict in that again as you know that s an evidentiary standards hearing so we ll be able to make sure that there is great clarity and certainty as to the type of scientific evidence that needs to be presented as you know and you probably saw in the journal of american medical association article published just a few weeks ago probably one of the most comprehensive reports evaluating all studies from independent sources found no link between talc and cancer so we think that s again another independent source and we think those facts those that data that scientific research will bear out in the end thank you larry biegelsen wells fargo analyst great thanks christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations thanks larry rob next question please operator your next question is from david lewis with morgan stanley david lewis morgan stanley analyst great just a couple of questions this morning joe just one clarification and one qualitative on revenue so the 5 to 6 operational guidance for 2020 the way to think about that is that includes about 50 basis points to 100 basis points of the net effect of selling days adjusted for the consumers skus joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer that s exactly right david david lewis morgan stanley analyst okay and just a follow up on revenue and one more quick one after that just qualitatively joe can you sort of help us understand 2020 how you see it framing up from a pharmaceutical consumer and medical device business and historically you ve given us a sense of sort of which businesses are likely to accelerate and which businesses are sort of more stable so across pharma md and consumer how do you see sort of the qualitative parameters driving the 2020 guide joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer yeah thanks for the question david so we have i think right now it is across all three of our businesses if you look at pharmaceuticals we will continue to accelerate growth i would say we ll be above market it s probably not as robust as we would have thought this time last year again because we were able to retain some of the business that was subject to generic and biosimilar competition but again very healthy growth above market and we ll be looking to complement the portfolio certainly with advancing our pipeline we ve got a couple of things that are hopefully will be filed this year around ponesimod for multiple sclerosis we hope to gain approval on the darzalex subcutaneous formulation which is a tremendous benefit for patients and we ll see the continued uptake of balversa and spravato in medical devices we re very pleased and just to put it into some context for the analyst community here in 2017 we grew 1 6 in 2017 2018 i m sorry we grew 2 7 and now we re up to 3 9 and we re not done so we re going to continue to accelerate growth be toward that in the middle of the market range that we believe is on the horizon for 2020 and that s before we have the opportunity to launch what we think will be a very differentiated offering around digital robotic surgery in consumer again as alex mentioned in some of his remarks we have focused on profitability there we focused putting investment behind our stronghold categories of skin health and self care so that would be tylenol and motrin for self care aveeno and neutrogena for skin health those brands continue to do extremely well i would suspect we grow more in line with the market for that category except for the sku rationalization where we ll be looking to de prioritize some less productive brands okay david lewis morgan stanley analyst and joe and then just joe just one quick question follow up on margins in some of the years you ve had sort of other income headwinds you ve been able to offset it with more significant sg a gains driving margins you re talking about a 100 basis points of margin expansion into 2020 medical devices with the jv agreement continues to track well are there just spending dynamics or more visibility on sort of 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion in 2020 headwinds and tailwinds we should be thinking about thanks so much joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i don t know chris if you want to add something christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations i just wanted to amplify in consumer just examples of that tylenol and neutrogena for the full year this past year neutrogena at 6 growth tylenol 9 growth just to build on what you were sharing on consumer joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer right ok thanks chris with respect to margin expansion david i think we would look to certainly manufacturing capabilities and improving our productivity there i would point to the consumer sku rationalization the design behind that is specifically to improve profitability and then we ll continue to look at other opportunities for enabling functions across finance hr information technology and procurement to get savings so we think we re in pretty good shape to deliver that for 2020 christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations great thanks david appreciate the questions rob next question please operator your next question comes from kristen stewart with barclays kristen stewart barclays analyst hi thanks for taking my question just one clarification the extra week with the sku rationalization it s a net impact overall it s 50 to a 100 to the top line is that correct joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer that s correct kristen kristen stewart barclays analyst okay perfect just want to clarify that and then just a big picture i guess question just on portfolio and capital allocation i know you had mentioned just in terms of models need to take into consideration with the share count no further share repurchase activity you guys are in a pretty good position obviously from a share i m sorry cash flow perspective generating 20 billion this year it sounds like your expectation is to pay out the opioid settlement but i guess why not get more aggressive from a share repurchase perspective just how should we think about capital allocation going forward alex gorsky chairman board of directors and chief executive officer hey kristen this is alex thank you very much for the question and look we re really proud of our strong performance across our businesses and frankly as it relates to our capital allocation model this year and we re very confident in it going forward as we mentioned in the results earlier if you think about the free cash flow spin off that we had in 2019 i think it s indicative of not only great discipline across our various lines and you see the p l in front of you so overall it was quite healthy but it s also important to note that we did that in the context of also continuing to invest in more than 11 acquisitions about six licensing agreements where we invested almost 7 5 billion just in the course of the year so as we talked about in the past we ll continue to invest in our brands and in research and development at an appropriate rate if you go back over the last four years i think if you add the numbers up in r d we ve invested more than 45 billion during that timeframe and we think that based upon the number of new product launches in our pharma medical device business and our consumer business that we ve gotten a good return on that we ve continued to keep a healthy dividend at the same time we realize how important that is during that same timeframe four years it s a pretty similar number to our r d it s about 40 billion to 45 billion and of course after that we always take a look at value creating acquisitions and again during that same timeframe i think the number comes to about 50 billion that we ve invested over the past year of note was you might say the additional investment that we made in auris and we think combining that with the later buyout that we did with the verb with verb and verily is the right thing if you think ahead in medical devices there are probably few things that are going to represent a more secular shift in that domain than the shift into digital and robotic surgery and bringing those together we think creates a very exciting opportunity for us but we also continue to do value creating tuck in opportunities as well in our pharmaceutical businesses we just talked about the end of the year we brought in two really exciting compounds bermekimab in particular in both as as well as other conditions we think it represents a great opportunity and it s certainly in an area where we ve got a lot of capability and a lot of expertise and finally we talk about share repurchases and i think we ve demonstrated over the last four or five years that we ll certainly employee share repurchases when we think that we re undervalued particularly in a significant way and again i think an outcome of the way that we manage our overall p l it means that we can do these things simultaneously it s not necessarily in order and we continue to we expect to continue that strategy going forward kristen stewart barclays analyst okay great joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer yeah kristen just a quick comment and thanks for noticing the comments around share count i have to tip my hat and complement the investment community because when we go through the consensus p l the income in terms of absolute dollars was almost spot on it was the yearly close in fact and then really the disconnect came in the form of share count where the average share count used in consensus was about 14 million shares less which translates to about 0 05 or 0 06 so we thought we were very much in line with what consensus expectations were and while we don t provide guidance assuming any share repurchase that s not currently authorized it seems that a few analysts may have made that assumption kristen stewart barclays analyst okay perfect thank so much christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations great thank you kristen rob next question please operator next question is from the line of josh jennings with cowen josh jennings cowen company analyst hi good morning thanks for taking the questions first is on robotics and you clearly have put a stake in the ground and with investments pursuing leadership in digital surgery ecosystem i just wanted to see if and i understand we re going to get a big update at the med device day in may but if you could whet our appetite at all today just give any updates on progress in the auris launch the timelines for orthotaxy and then any indications that you see where robotics is not in play today that could come into play over the next three to five years within your portfolio and then second question is just for joe and alex i guess it s just on you know the other income line has been a focus i think the concerns are where that could fall off next year or in the out years and you talk about your process for portfolio review and then pruning i mean the underperforming assets or assets don t fit under your roof if you could just talk about that process and how regiment it is is there a formula is there 1 of the portfolio that gets pruned every year or is it just strategic and opportunistic annually thanks for taking the questions and i apologize for the background noise alex gorsky chairman board of directors and chief executive officer hey josh thank you very much for the question and look i am really glad that you mentioned robotics and digital in terms of an entire platform for us because of course that s exactly what it is and let s start first with our acquisition of auris health and overall what we would say it s off to a great start where we couldn t be more thrilled to have the robotics pioneer and former ceo fred moll and his team at j j the monarch platform is off to a very good start it s going to play a critical role in our lung cancer initiative and when you just look at the science and the technology and what it can do with the distal parts of the lung and what it brings in terms of potentially ablation leveraging it with our neuwave technology and even longer term having the potential to dispense oncolytic viruses in treating cancer in very new and unique ways is exciting physicians can perform more than 2000 bronchoscopy procedures with the monarch platform and we re really pleased with what we re seeing with it second you saw our announcement on verb and we think combining auris and verb really helps ensure that we have a very strong role in the next generation of the digital surgery platform and ongoing development our teams are working now together in a really comprehensive way we do look sorry for that feedback but we do look at this as a platform that is something that will be in place for the next several decades therefore it s really important that we step through this in the right way and what i would say is the early results from the collaboration and the partnership that we re seeing between these teams is very encouraging and that s why we re excited to give you this preview that joe mentioned on may 13th in new york because we think it will provide very clear transparent kind of tangible evidence of not only the machines but also the digital platform component of this as well next we re really excited about the progress that s being made with velys in our orthopedics robotics platform as well it s an exciting technology we think that it s going to offer a portable low cost system that s easy to use will improve accuracy it also is a nice combination to ensure if the surgeon remains intimately involved and if we look at the training and technical support it s something that will be easily coordinated between ors and surgeon so we re progressing toward a mid year 2020 regulatory submission for this so really if you just step back and you think about what we have going with auris and monarch if you think about the plans now that we have in place with velys in orthopaedics and then longer term as we bring out that next generation of digital and robotics platform more broadly across surgery we re very excited about it joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer and josh to address your question regarding the management of our portfolio so i would say it s rigorous it s not formulaic though so we meet as a management team and executive committee monthly on what additions or deletions from our portfolio makes sense and that and makes sense probably should be defined in terms of we have aspirations in all the markets we play in to be either number one or number two in that space with the promise of bringing better solutions in that space to patients and consumers across the globe we have plans in place for all of our businesses to do that but after a period of time when those plans don t come to fruition we ll assess other alternatives i would say under alex s leadership we ve gotten very disciplined in this this rigor and that s proved to be pretty productive i think in terms of how we ve been able to take underperforming businesses turn that into gains and reinvest back in businesses in areas that we think we ve got a differentiated right to win christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations thanks josh appreciate the questions rob next question please operator your next question is from matt miksic with credit suisse matt miksic credit suisse analyst hi thanks for taking the question so i just had one follow up on one of your business lines in med devices in orthopedics clearly it looks like you were able to deliver a pretty solid improvement in knees in the u s and just was wondering if you d be willing to offer any color on the spine growth within the sort spine and other category i think which parts of that were what are the drivers of the decline and then i had one follow up if i could for alex on digital health alex gorsky chairman board of directors and chief executive officer so thanks for the question matt good to speak with you so we are very proud of the knees performance if you look that was declining business in 2018 we ve had almost a two point improvement there so the team has done a very nice job we have attune both the primary as well as the revision platform available for patients we ve also made an entry into the cementless side of the business which as you know is the fastest growing piece of that business and as alex mentioned we look forward to what velys could do on the horizon with respect to spine i think you have to take into account the impact of 2018 u s rebate adjustment which impacted comparative growth about 250 basis points if you look at the growth in the u s it was probably about half of the decline of what you saw based on that comparison we continue to see pretty good growth outside the u s specifically in asia pacific i don t know chris if there is any other commentary in spine other christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations yeah matt i would just say if you adjust for that i would say the business has stabilized at low single digit declines where we re seeing success is where we have new innovation in particular in degenerative spine with our 3d cage and our viper prime systems i think the next level of improvements will come from symphony system in posterior cervical which was launched later this year so we really didn t get that benefit in this year at all and we ll expect to see that continued improvement through next year and beyond matt miksic credit suisse analyst that s great and then just a follow up appreciate the update and overview on the robotic surgery strategy alex but i guess one of the things that we ve noticed is just how quickly and i realize it s sort of a buzzwordy term and we see it in a lot of magazines but artificial intelligence in digital health for whatever reason implementation and you know innovation but it seems to be moving perhaps the fastest of the categories of digital surgery and digital health just wondering one of your competitors has partnered with a smaller innovator in that space around stroke i m sure you re watching it i m sure you re making investments and looking at it just curious if you could give us an update or a preview perhaps of which you ll talk about in the spring alex gorsky chairman board of directors and chief executive officer sure thanks again for the question matt look i there are a few areas across our different innovation or technology platforms that are not being touched by some of this new technology whether it s ai whether it s ml whether it s digital whether it s the cloud i mean if you think about just our pharmaceutical portfolio for example and you talk to paul stoffels or mathai mammen or bill hait i think what they would tell you is one of the most important areas supporting that is our data sciences capabilities and the insights that we can gain from reviewing these large datasets and coming and developing much better insights frankly is helping lead us to a much faster and more productive identification of new targets and it certainly is helping us when we apply those same skills and capabilities of the clinical development programs as you work with hospitals and large medical systems and you can review medical health records for example in a much more detailed way in terms of patient selection and tracking through development so we re certainly excited about there as it relates to medical devices we ve been i think very consistent in sharing our thinking that again this next generation is certainly about the robotics component that helps facilitate perhaps having more consistency in an exact procedure perhaps getting into a tighter space having better access but we think longer term the digital ai component of that in terms of helping preoperatively in developing a very detailed plan even being applied intraoperatively in terms of additional guidance systems and by the way then that can be not only to help a surgeon get to a particular area but it could also be to help him or her stay away from areas that may and could cause a problem and so and then of course how that information can be utilized by large healthcare systems to really ensure that they ve got the most effective and efficient and value added healthcare delivery program is in place we think will be more important than ever so hence our reason for partnering with verb and verily and alphabet in building those capabilities and again it s something that more broadly across johnson johnson we re spending a lot of time thinking about how all those capabilities are going to become more and more a part of our of our doing business of our doing research and development across each one of our sectors christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations thanks matt appreciate the questions matt miksic credit suisse analyst thank you christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations rob next question please operator your next question is from danielle antalffy with svb leerink danielle antalffy svb leerink analyst hey good morning guys thanks so much for taking the question just wanted to talk a little bit more about medical devices specifically you guys saw a pretty strong sales growth acceleration on an operational adjusted basis this year how do we think about the next year i know ashley has said in the past it s not linear quarterly but i suspect we should be looking for another uptick can you help talk about that and what specifically will be the drivers in 2020 of that alex gorsky chairman board of directors and chief executive officer sure danielle thank you very much for the question look we re again we re really proud of the progress that ashley and her team has made over the last several years joe took you through the improvement from 2017 to 18 to 2019 and we certainly expect that trajectory to continue in the coming years if i just kind of zero down for a moment though on 2019 we saw first half growth of about 3 8 and we saw growth in the second half at 4 and while there is a bit of lumpiness in the quarters consistent with ashley s comments and look we re still taking a look at q4 we think that the timing of the holidays and a few other things i think you always have to be careful what you attribute but if you just look at the number of days between some of those we think that that could potentially have had an impact but it really doesn t change the overall trend of accelerated growth in second half versus first half now if we look at our business it s really being driven by a number of factors in our surgery business what you re seeing is strong performance in areas like electrophysiology another 14 growth in this quarter with great new technology we expect a continuous launch in the coming year as well with new products you also saw good performance in our energy business so just about 3 growth and biosurgery coming in at about 4 growth we think one of the growth drivers frankly is just overcoming our supply issue in 2020 that probably cut our biosurgery growth rate and half especially in the latter part of the year so we think once we work our way through that that s going to be a growth driver for us our circular stapler launch is also going well we re going to lap the recall as well that we had in the past year so we think those are definitely drivers in our core surgery business if we look at orthopaedics here too we ve seen the steady cadence of improvement our knee business attune the launch of the cementless the revision is going very well and you think about it we ve turn that from being down almost 0 5 to 1 to growing at 1 4 in this quarter which again shows physicians increasing confidence in that platform and we re starting to see an uptick again in attune primaries and so we re really pleased to see that and then of course our hip performance coming in at over 4 strong trauma at about 2 5 we think is pretty consistent with the market chris addressed some of the issues in spine and how we see that moving forward and then of course there s vision care and i think what we see in vision care is fundamentally strong performance in contact lens you saw about 3 growth overall in our contact lens business but what s important to note there is we had 9 growth in the united states so the transition lens the astig lens daily disposables continue to go well frankly we ve been disappointed in some of our surgical performance particularly in the u s we ve got plans in place to address that if you look at the ongoing rollout that we re going to have with the tecnis and the symphony and the synergy we re very optimistic that it s going to make us more competitive not only in the astig area but really across that entire platform so we re confident that that s going to lead to continued growth trends as we go through 2020 and certainly setting ourselves up for even continued growth beyond that as well danielle antalffy svb leerink analyst thank you so much christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations thanks danielle appreciate it rob next question please operator the next question is from terence flynn with goldman sachs terence flynn goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks for taking the questions maybe just two from me you guys presented additional data at ash from your bcma car t program in myeloma and recently got breakthrough designation are planning to file for approval later this year i would love your initial thoughts on overcoming some of the hurdles faced by other car t drugs and longer term where you see this drug playing a role in the treatment paradigm the second question relates to the fda announcement of a meeting next month on testing methods for asbestos and talc i was just wondering if the company is participating and then what you think the key issues are that are going to be discussed there thank you alex gorsky chairman board of directors and chief executive officer sure terence thank you very much let me take the first one regarding the car t data at ash as i m sure you saw when we released the data we were very excited when we saw those results and again here too i think it s maybe important to just step back and think about the steps that our team has taken over the last several years regarding car t therapy and when you look at the different development programs that are out there how we were able to support or source this from legend the way that we were able to accelerate the development timelines the ongoing great work that our supply chain is doing as well to ensure that we ve got the strong integrity of that supply chain the dependability that s put in place we re really proud of the progress they made i think the results that we shared at ash demonstrate our increasing confidence and by the way we think this is great news for patients particularly those who have failed multiple other treatment lines in a very difficult to treat condition like multiple myeloma and as we think about it going forward look we think that this is truly an opportunity to transform the way patients are treated in this space we ve got a lot of confidence in our reimbursement teams i think we demonstrated in other areas that we can work with payers in a very collaborative way we re also innovative not only in the products that we re bringing but frankly in the reimbursement programs that we introduced as well and we intend to work just that way with payers and providers both in the united states but also abroad ultimately to make sure that this therapy is available for patients they can get access to it and that it s not only as effective as the data that you that we saw at ash but it s also cost effective to the overall healthcare system joe did you want to joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer sure and terence with respect to the meeting i believe it s next month february 4th regarding testing methods around talc we certainly welcome any discussion around the safety and efficacy of the product specifically we will not be active participants at that meeting however i can say that our current internal testing methods exceed that of current fda standards for cosmetic talc terence flynn goldman sachs analyst great christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations thank you terence appreciate the questions rob we have time for one last question operator yes that last question will be coming from louise chen with cantor fitzgerald louise chen cantor fitzgerald analyst hi thanks for taking my questions here so my first question for you is what your view on m a is this year and what areas you re most interested in is it pharma consumer or devices or all the above and then my second question is how optimistic are you regarding a universal settlement for opioids thank you joseph j wolk executive vice president chief financial officer okay let me take the first part of that louise thank a lot for the question look i think we demonstrated in 2019 as i mentioned earlier that we remained active really across all three areas i think we did 11 acquisitions six licensing agreements and putting more than 7 billion worth of capital to work we have continued i think our pattern of tuck in acquisitions where we get new technologies as you saw that we did with both xbiotech and other opportunities in our pharmaceutical business we would expect to continue that we also did a had a fair amount of activity in our medical device group led by auris that we did earlier in the year and then in our consumer group of course that was led by dr ci labo which also gave us a great toehold you might say into the premium beauty segment particularly in asia but with plans to expand that into the united states so we ll be looking across all three of our segments but we would expect there to be an ongoing cadence of m a activity in those different areas alex gorsky chairman board of directors and chief executive officer and louise with respect to the opioid settlement so we continue to work with the negotiating committee of the state attorney general s to finalize the agreement in principle i would say we remain optimistic and confident that the agreement is moving forward but certainly can t predict when that agreement in principle will be finalized so we ll continue to monitor that engage as needed and hopefully come to a resolution christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations thanks louise appreciate it and thanks to everyone for your questions and continued interest in our company apologies to those we couldn t get to because of time but don t hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team as needed i ll now turn the call back to alex just for some closing comments alex gorsky chairman board of directors and chief executive officer well thank you everybody for your ongoing support across 2019 as we mentioned earlier we re very proud of our strong performance but we re even more excited and more confident about what the prospects hold for 2020 and beyond i think we had a chance to review a lot of the opportunities that lie in front of us and we look forward to continuing to keep you updated throughout the year as we progress through our plan so thank you very much everybody and have a great day operator duration 89 minutes call participants christopher delorefice vice president of investor relations alex gorsky chairman

trump is leaning on the strong u s economy to project strength among the global elite as he gears up for a bruising reelection battle and a new round of tense trade negotiations with the european union trump delivered a stark warning to the world economic forum in davos switzerland that he will remain undeterred behind his america first agenda as the u s seeks more favorable trading terms with europe the president stressed in his speech that the new year was a time for optimism and urged attendees to reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse trump began the day taking a victory lap touting recent trade victories a strong stock market and a growing economy but shortly after he also floated grave economic consequences for europe if trade talks between the u s and european union collapse i explain here why trump is barreling a conflict with the eu what it could to the european economy and why his past trade successes may not translate in europe what trump wants after signing a preliminary trade deal with china and securing the u s mexico canada agreement usmca the president is eager to claim another trade victory to tout on the campaign trail trump is seeking a commitment from europe to purchase vastly greater quantities of u s crops to boost the ailing american agriculture sector by lowering eu tariffs on foreign ag products trump is also seeking to bolster his image as the senate began his impeachment trial earlier tuesday which could be politically damaging even if as is expected he is acquitted what trump will do trump renewed his threat to impose tariffs on european automobiles if the u s and eu were unable to strike a trade deal doing so could devastate the continent s economy according to experts with europe already teetering on the edge of recession the remarks were seen as a sign trump will not relent in his battle with the eu with a strong economy at his back and with a gauntlet of challenges between him and the 2020 election in a nutshell thinks he is an absolute position of strength so why would he treat the eu as an equal challenger or partner if he thinks that ultimately the u s is in the strongest position said marie kasperek senior fellow at the atlantic council a washington d c think tank more from trump s first day in davos president trump and french president emmanuel macron spoke about france s digital tax on monday reaching a truce under which france has agreed to postpone its tax until the end of the year while the u s will postpone tariffs on that note treasury secretary steven mnuchin warned the united kingdom and italy that they will face tariffs if they move forward with digital taxes the wall street journal reported tuesday president trump also told the journal that he will release a new tax cut plan within 90 days though it would need to pass the democratic controlled house to become law leading the day breaking down trump s trade deals trump claims trade victories with revised nafta china deal president trump claimed victory on two fronts of his global trade war last week after securing a preliminary deal with china and a replacement for the north american free trade agreement nafta the senate approved trump s nafta rewrite dubbed the united states mexico canada agreement usmca by a resounding margin thursday one day after the president signed a phase one trade deal with china s vice premier liu he trump celebrated the two deals as promises kept to his supporters less than a year before election day each deal gives trump an arsenal of big numbers to tout on the campaign trail and even some of trump s fiercest critics backed his nafta reboot but trade experts say the deals may do more to boost the president s reelection campaign than the u s s trade relationships particularly with china i explain why here read more four key parts of trump s china trade deal experts say trump s china deal touches all but the biggest issues trump has touted his new deals as a crucial step toward stopping the bleeding of u s jobs but the agreement with china does not address the forces driving the decline in u s manufacturing employment and beijing s open ambition to dominate the production of essential technology by 2025 the deal also doesn t address china s long running practice of pouring subsidies into domestic companies to produce an oversupply of industrial materials such as steel to price out american competitors there are a long running series of challenges for the u s and china this deal doesn t even scratch said edward alden a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations there s a whole technology war going on alongside this trade war and that is going to continue in force this next year and beyond even as we have this trade truce economic impact of trade deals could be slight economists expect economic growth to slow in 2020 for the third year in a row and see only a minor bump if any from the trade deals no one s forecast has changed as a result of these arrangements said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics who has advised several democratic campaigns they re on the margins in terms of their macroeconomic impact he added referring to the two trade deals the hill s niv elis tells us why here sponsored content presented by wells fargo rising housing costs are forcing families to sacrifice basic needs like food health care and education wells fargo is committing 1 billion in philanthropic giving over the next six years to reduce the cost burden of housing and help american families move into safe stable and affordable homes conservatives hit back on 2020 wealth tax proposals conservative groups are hitting back on wealth tax proposals from progressive 2020 candidates like sens bernie sanders i vt and elizabeth warren d mass as polls show broad support for the taxes sanders and warren have made higher taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires a key part of their respective plans to tackle inequality but right leaning groups argue that a wealth tax would be harmful for the overall economy and hurt more people than just the ultra rich those groups are now making the case that once voters learn more about the potential consequences of wealth taxes public support will erode the hill s naomi jagoda tells us more about their campaign here good to know

interest margin decreased 13 basis points compared to the net interest margin of 3 95 in the three months ended september 30 2019 the decrease in the margin from the prior year fourth quarter was primarily the result of an increase in the average interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings as well as decreases in the average yield on loans and other interest earning assets the

strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans the notional amount of the swap is 400 million with a termination date in october 2025 under the terms of the swap the company receives a fixed rate of interest of 3 018 and pays a floating rate of interest equal to one month usd libor the floating rate resets monthly and net settlements of interest due to from the counterparty also occur

usd libor the company will receive net interest settlements which will be recorded as loan interest income if one month usd libor exceeds the fixed rate of interest in future periods the company will be required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and will record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans the company recorded loan interest income related to this swap transaction of 1 2 million and 3 1 million respectively in the three months and year ended december 31 2019 the company s net interest margin has been positively impacted by significant additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the fdic assisted transactions on an ongoing basis the company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools for each of the loan portfolios acquired the cash flow estimates increased during the current and prior periods presented below based on payment histories and reduced credit loss expectations this resulted in increased income that has been spread on a level yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools and therefore has decreased over time additional estimated cash flows reclassification of discounts from non accretable to accretable totaling approximately 1 9 million and 12 3 million were recorded in the three months and year ended december 31 2019 respectively related to these loan pools the impact to income of adjustments on all portfolios acquired in fdic assisted transactions for the reporting periods

million of interest income during 2020 in the first quarter of 2020 we will adopt the new accounting standard related to accounting for credit losses with the adoption of this standard there will be no more reclassification of discounts from non accretable to accretable subsequent to december 31 2019 all adjustments made prior to december 31 2019 will continue to be accreted to interest income excluding the impact of the additional yield accretion net interest margin for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 decreased 30 basis points when compared to the three months ended december 31 2018 and decreased eight basis points when compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the compression in our margin during the three months ended december 31 2019 was caused primarily by

for 2018 the higher efficiency ratio in the 2019 three month period was primarily due to an increase in non interest expense the decrease in the ratio for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income partially offset by a decrease in non interest income due to the gain on sale of certain branches and deposits in 2018 the company s ratio of non interest

2017 h r 1 originally known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tcj act was signed into law among other things the tcj act permanently lowered the corporate federal income tax rate to 21 from the prior maximum rate of 35 effective for tax years including or commencing january 1 2018 the company currently expects its effective tax rate combined federal and state to be approximately 17 0 to 18 5 in 2019 and future years mainly as a result of the tcj act for the three months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 the company s effective tax rate was 20 3 and 17 9 respectively for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 the company s effective tax rate was 18 3 and 18 1 respectively these effective rates were lower than the statutory federal tax rate of 21 due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and to tax exempt investments and tax exempt loans which reduced the company s effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the company s utilization of tax credits and the level of tax exempt investments and loans and the overall level of pre tax income the company s effective income tax rate is currently expected to continue to be less than the statutory rate due primarily to the factors noted above capital as of december 31 2019 total stockholders equity and common stockholders

loan portfolio presentation available on the company s investor relations website under presentations provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes is sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors including but not limited to past loss experience current portfolio mix actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio economic conditions and internal as well as external reviews the levels of non performing assets potential problem loans loan loss provisions and net charge offs fluctuate from period to period and are difficult to predict weak economic conditions higher inflation or interest rates or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense management maintains various controls in an attempt to limit future losses such as a watch list of possible problem loans documented loan administration policies and loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size loan type delinquencies financial analysis on going correspondence with borrowers and problem loan work outs management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense if necessary to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level the provision for loan losses for the quarter ended december 31 2019 was 650 000 compared with 2 0 million for the quarter ended december 31 2018 the provision for loan losses for the year ended december 31 2019 was 6 2 million compared with 7 2 million for the year ended december 31 2018 at december 31 2019 and 2018 the allowance for loan losses was 40 3 million and 38 4 million respectively total net charge offs were 762 000 and 1 0 million for the three months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively during the quarter ended december 31 2019 428 000 of the 762 000 of net charge offs were in the consumer auto category total net charge offs were 4 3 million and 5 2 million for the year ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively during the year ended december 31 2019 2 9 million of the 4 3 million of net charge offs were in the consumer auto category in addition two unrelated commercial loan relationships were responsible for 560 000 of the total net charge offs during the year ended december 31 2019 in response to a more challenging consumer credit environment the company tightened its underwriting guidelines on automobile lending in the latter part of 2016 management took this step in an effort to improve credit quality in the portfolio and reduce delinquencies and charge offs this action also resulted in a lower level of origination volume and as such the outstanding balance of the company s automobile loans continued to decline in the year ended december 31 2019 we have seen and expect to continue to see more rapid reductions in the automobile loan outstanding balance as we determined in february 2019 to cease providing indirect lending services to automobile dealerships at december 31 2019 indirect automobile loans totaled approximately 110 million we expect this total balance will be largely paid off in the next two years general market conditions and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects contributed to the level of provisions and charge offs collateral and repayment evaluations of all assets categorized as potential problem loans non performing loans or foreclosed assets were completed with corresponding charge offs or reserve allocations made as appropriate in june 2017 the loss sharing agreements with the fdic for inter savings bank were terminated in april 2016 the loss sharing agreements with the fdic for team bank vantus bank and sun security bank were terminated loans acquired from the fdic related to valley bank did not have a loss sharing agreement all acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition date these loan pools are systematically reviewed by the company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy great southern bank portfolio with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes review of financial information collateral valuations and customer interaction to determine if additional reserves are warranted the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans excluding fdic acquired loans was 1 00 0 98 and 0 99 at december 31 2019 december 31 2018 and september 30 2019 respectively management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio at december 31 2019 based on recent reviews of the bank s loan portfolio and current economic conditions if economic conditions were to deteriorate or management s assessment of the loan portfolio were to change it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required thereby adversely affecting the company s future results of operations and financial condition asset quality former teambank vantus bank sun security bank interbank and valley bank non performing assets including foreclosed assets and potential problem loans are not included in the totals or in the discussion of non performing loans potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below these assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates and are accounted for in pools therefore these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans the performance of the loan pools acquired in each of the five transactions has been better than expectations as of the acquisition dates as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio changes in economic and market conditions and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances the level of non performing assets will fluctuate non performing assets excluding all fdic assisted acquired assets at december 31 2019 were 8 2 million a decrease of 3 6 million from 11 8 million at december 31 2018 and a decrease of 820 000 from 9 0 million at september 30 2019 non performing assets excluding all fdic assisted acquired assets as a

document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap these non gaap financial measures include core net interest income core net interest margin and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio we calculate core net interest income and core net interest margin by subtracting the impact of adjustments regarding changes in expected cash flows related to pools of loans we acquired through fdic assisted transactions from reported net interest income and net interest margin management believes that core net interest income and core net interest margin are useful in assessing the company s core performance and trends in light of the fluctuations that can occur related to updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the 2009 2011 2012 and 2014 fdic assisted transactions in calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets we subtract period end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations as it provides a method to assess management s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets which are subjective components of valuation facilitates the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers in addition management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance these non gaap financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on gaap financial measures because not all companies use the same calculation of non gaap measures this presentation

when today wednesday january 22 2020 where cnbc s squawk box live from the world economic forum in davos switzerland the following is the unofficial transcript of a cnbc interview with jpmorgan chase chairman ceo jamie dimon on cnbc s squawk box live from the world economic forum in davos switzerland today wednesday january 22nd the following is a link to video from the interview on cnbc com all references must be sourced to cnbc becky quick more reaction to the president s comments the state of the economy and the markets and much more we re joined by jamie dimon he is jpmorgan chase chairman ceo it s great to see you today jamie dimon happy to be here quick one of the stocks that helped fuel that rally has been jpmorgan you re just coming off your most profitable year ever you talked an awful lot about the strength of consumer what you re seeing in the united states what s happening in the beginning part of 2020 after such a successful 2019 welcome everybody welcome viewers so the economy is doing fine 2020 just began but the consumer is strong 70 of the gdp is the consumer and the balance sheet is in great shape housing is in short supply confidence is way up and wages are up jobs are up millions come back to work there are probably millions more that are going to come back to work things are working on the corporate side and did have a reduction in confidence and capex mostly in my view related to trade that may have leveled off this point because now you have some positive trade news about the usmca and the china trade deal quick joe actually asked the president about that this morning when he sat down with him do you expect to see the return of capex it sounds like you do expect to see a rise in capital expenditures this year dimon i think its very possible and remember a lot of companies do capex when they need to receivables go up inventory goes up they build that plan when there s demand for the product you have already seen more capex on the consumer side and you may see it more on the manufacturing side global growth is 3 3 not terrible so you can see continued growth quick part of the reason that you had such strong revenue last year in part was because of what happened with trading revenue it rebounded pretty sharply in 2019 how are markets feeling to you right now how do things look dimon they re fine the trading actually is not that big of a part of it we re up across the board we look at more things like number of customer satisfaction number of accounts market shares which we try to drive all the time but the markets right now are fine they are in a goldilocks place quick i was going to say fine sounds like it s almost underselling when you look at new records being set every day do you have any trepidation about anything that you see here dimon the only thing i have trepidayion about is negative interest rates qe and then diversion between stock prices and bond prices and yield and stuff like that it s one of the great experiments of all time and we don t know what the ultimate outcome is andrew ross sorkin are you in favor of the way powell has approached this dimon yeah sorkin do you think he s in responsible in large part for this do you think it s fiscal policy or monetary policy that created this goldilocks period dimon i think it s a little bit of both but goldilocks has two sides to it but i also think we have to have coordinated fiscal monetary policy and regulatory policy you see china do that in the united states you don t see it so much industrial regulatory fiscal if you want to grow faster and not cause some of the problems that could be caused by rapidly rising rates or something like that yo uare going to need both and you are going to need it globally quick that sounds like you don t think that the federal reserve should operate independently from the white house and the president dimon no they can be completely independent that doesn t mean they can t be coordinated if they feel if governments do x they will be very comfortable doing y that s not lack of independence you both independently said that s a good course for the country let s go do it but you go to china they do it all the time quick obviously but china also tells its companies what to do dimon yeh they can manage their economy much better and we failed to do that we need to have more coordinated policy quick who runs the ship in that situation is congress supposed to listen to the fed in terms of what to do is the fed supposed to listen to congress how does the white house play into that because it sounds like you re right i could absolutely see how we could better manage our economy doing that but it does sound counter to how we have operated to this point dimon i m not sure that it s true if you read history books about the fed and the government usually through the administration they have sat down and had coordinated policies to accomplish the goals of the country they did it together in the great depression and they did it to get out of world war ii multiple times quick those were in times of crisis sorkin but even arguably after the crisis even in 2008 they didn t do it yes they had a stimulus plan but clearly the retrospective was big enough there were lots of things that ben bernanke was screaming and hollering and saying please you were screaming everyone is saying and bernanke has said he lowered interest rates in large part because he couldn t get congress to move dimon i think it s very hard for central banks to forever make up for bad policy elsewhere and that puts them in a trap and we are a little bit in that trap today rates are so low around the world quick do you think that s a bigger problem in the us or because of europe dimon much bigger problem in europe quick where it is negative interest rates that s kind of gotten them into that rut dimon yes do you know of anyone who has actually bought a negative interest rate bond quick no that s what president trump said this morning dimon because the buyers of central banks and certain banks insurance companies didn t have to or index mutual funds or passive funds i would never buy a negative rate bond quick why would you dimon not unless i was forced quick hold my money dimon in history whenever you have seen something like that in history it doesn t necessarily end well quick i know that we have been talking about this for a long time what do you think the potential end looks like when do you think it comes are there any signs to say we re getting closer to a point where this actually does play out dimon i don t know quick what would you watch for dimon the biggest surprise would be inflation any kind of inflation in the united states and right now people think central banks around the world can do whatever they want they can t they have to be reactors as opposed to just actors if you see adverse consequences going a certain way they re intelligent looking at all the facts and figuring out what to do but that would be the big negative sorkin do you see bubbles dimon only in sovereign debt sorkin sovereign debt is where you see the bubble dimon yeah sorkin you don t see the bubble even we had uber on a lot of these privacy companies is that a bubble dimon it s not a bubble because those are in total not that big and yeh some are overpriced we always had overpriced companies in life and stock prices are at a high those prices can be justified if you have a growing economy we have had 11 years of growth australia has had 28 joe kernen if i try to really be half full and optimistic it s true here we are at these rates that seem like they re not normalized and they don t seem appropriate they don t seem appropriate for where unemployment is right now the rates where we are but if inflation is really because of technology and innovation why not in an expansion leave rates low let corporate earnings catch up with where stock prices are maybe this isn t maybe the stock prices aren t just following the fed and central banks up maybe it s more than that maybe it s justified maybe it s not just cheap money dimon the other reason i think it s been so slow is my point to you all before is over the last 11 years we have had 23 growth it should have been 40 plus it would have been normal people act like it was just slow not it wasn t it was our own bad infrastructure policy work skills policy litigation regulation taxations i can go on and on and what we did to ourselves to slow down growth slow growth means less need for capital lower rates lower growth lower wages we need a growth strategy which is why you say fiscals it s not just spending more money do the things that create more growth and then acknowledge that you can help people left behind sorkin what do you do in a country that s clearly politically so polarized that virtually nothing gets done that s the fundamental question dimon they have gotten some things done recently they did do a budget deal usmca done they got the china trade deal done they got tax reform done regulatory reform done if it were up to me that i d make congress compromise i think it is absurd in a democracy that your starting point is you won t compromise that is what a democracy is we don t completely agree and then we find our way ok i will do this for you and you do this for me and now we agree sorkin you just listed a number of accomplishments by the administration one of the things we have been talking about for the last few days is how the davos community in large part has been a surprise two years later three years later now because when he first came into office there was such trepidation and anxiety and worry that the economy wasn t going to go up it was going to go down dimon right sorkin what do you think everyone got wrong kernen we all read your piece quick your piece in the time it says unless we change capitalism we might lose it forever that s the headline dimon no the headline is always not the accurate thing what did we get wrong sorkin yeah dimon that good policy matters good government matters we don t build infrastructure it takes us ten years to get the permit to build a bridge half the kids in inner city schools don t graduate litigation costs 1 more in our country health care is 19 of gdp our competitor comes at 9 immigration if we had an immigration bill would e 0 2 a year a year of more growth so we haven t done these things that s why i don t think it is china or trade or technology i think it is the bad policy in the united states and you ve seen similar things in europe by the way fortunately you have macron in europe trying to change it you need labor flexibility innovation positive capital and you need all of these things to have a vibrant economy which is good for everybody the politicians should focus on that in addition to focus on who is left behind you have more wealth to take care of everybody if you have a better growing economy sorkin you said you were barely a democrat i think you said that many many years ago you look at this election is there a democrat that you like people dimon yeah i like a lot of the moderates not a socialist i mean capitalism is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind i think that people who haven t read history books about socialism really should educating younger kids freedom and free enterprise are inextricably linked they re not different you can t tell people where you can work and how you are going to work free enterprise was the pursuit of happiness and once you have governments taking control of businesses it ends up in corruption in venezuela and it erodes over time because companies get used for political purposes not to give you great products and services does that mean they re perfect no sorkin if it is trump and bernie or elizabeth warren what do you do dimon that does not mean that we can t acknowledge that some people are left behind i have already mentioned inner city school kids i think wages need to go up on the lower end a lot of the business round table is in favor of increasing the tax credit get more money to people to give them more of a living wage i would be in favor of universal healthcare if it was properly done you could design these things badly or well and we have just gotten really bad at designing them well quick jamie you just listed a laundry list of things that you think government should be doing but waiting for them to fix it and do it better you have gotten impatient and as a ceo you have taken matters into your own hands i m thinking of haven the health care initiative that you at jpmorgan along with berkshire hathaway and amazon have been working on do you have any updates there anything you can tell us about what is happening dimon i really don t because its still nascent we are doing some test experiments and big data but i think the business roundtable which i am not the chairman anymore it s attacking the issues head on work skills like how you get into cities and get kids more trained for jobs either out of high school or community college certified training infrastructure they ve got programs for infrastructure and immigration if you go to the brt site these things need to get done and it will be much better for america the brt supporting raising the minimum wage and supports expanding the urban tax credit both which would get wages to the lower paid giving them opportunity like through schools education and those things work they are known to work in any country that has ever done them properly they work and you have a more equitable society you have to match skills and we have a lot whole more stuff coming out and things like that kernen 3 5 unemployment match the skills and then you get organic wage growth which we re already starting to see it is much higher than it was dimon i think the bottom quintile or bottom 10 is up 8 for two years in a row or something we would typically see in a recovery it just took a long time that s a very slow recovery kernen what you don t see with crappy policies that lock the fed in at zero it exacerbates wealth income inequality and that s what we saw prior to this sorkin there s lots of reasons for that becky mentioned this piece that you wrote in time magazine and we wanted to ask you about it it refers specifically to what seems like you polled young people about the word capitalism and they may be on the socialist side of things dimon honestly i don t think they understand what socialism is socialism is when the government controls companies there s no example of when the government controls companies they do well and they don t start to use it for votes satisfying people they don t even want competitiion why have competition they do it for jobs and votes they have bad allocation of capital most state run enterprises don t do a particularly good job if you take a look around the world and they become corrupt overtime that does not mean that capitalism is perfect does not mean that every public company is perfect no they re flaws sorkin do you think that bernie sanders or elizabeth warren are socialists in the construct that you talked about it or this construct of a democratic socialist it is something that may feel more european in some ways dimon i don t want to talk about any particular people but if you re talking about governments controlling corporations that s socialism you can do it in a small way or a big way the small way is to put a commissar on your board remember the old russian commissars could sit in the room or do it through regulatory or stuff like that the other way is that they actually own the company look at all the other countries and they start to take over the oil companies and the steel companies and utility companies and the banks the banks start making loans not to good company not because they are properly allocating capital to its highest and best use but to keep that factory open the bridge to nowhere to make sure the mayor doesn t lose jobs in his town and once you do that you will have an eroding society having said all that it doesn t mean that things don t need to be fixed they need to be fixed inner city schools infrastructure education healthcare we could fix all of those sorkin what did you make of larry fink s letter last week dimon i read it it s fine climate is a real issue i think most people want to be part of the solution we are going to be 100 green this year we are doing 200 billion in green financing probably going to be increased some time this year we only do responsible financing we don t do mountain top removal we don t do dirty coal mines and you need a transition at the end of the day what the public needs to know you can yell and scream all you want at private enterprise you need government policy government policy it s the only thing that will globally solve this problem and at the end of the day you need carbon tax and the great thing called the carbon dividend where it doesn t get sent back to washington it gets sent back to the people and you start buying things or doing things that make more sense get a small car sorkin does it make sense for companies like microsoft to announce their own plans and try to be carbon negative or try to run expensing around carbon dimon it makes sense to show their intent and to want to do a better job and say it s important sorkin is that real is it marketing dimon it s not going to solve the global problem okay you have two countries that are growing the pollution dramatically i m not against them but india and china america is already coming down 20 the last 15 years or something you will not solve the problem without real government policy so i appreciate all the people saying stop doing this stop doing that and all that happens someone else will make a lot more money than you because the world needs the energy you need policy what you need is government policy r d and carbon tax the citizens of the world have to take a vote at that level and understand it s going to have some sacrifice sorkin you would advocate for a carbon tax to be 100 clear dimon absolutely with a carbon dividend sorkin with the dividend dimon co2 this means based on some sorkin you mean the smoky stuff it s odorless colorless gas dimon yeah but it could be kernen what about clean water what about chemical waste what about what we have done with strip mining all of those things are okay too how about clean water dimon most of us need to be cleaned up kernen not really we re a little bit focused on all of this you were just telling me about i don t know dimon i look at carbon a different way there s a risk that something is going terribly wrong here we could handle that risk today and rather painlessly if you do it right kernen we need to decide what the problem is whether it s causing slight warming or whether it s causing every single adverse weather event that s been occurring on its own for 4 billion years more snow less snow more flooding less flooding dimon forget all of that kernen but that s what they equate it to now dimon that s so people can get noise about it but if we have a co2 problem in the air which is hurting the world and most of the scientists say that my view is if their is chance it is bad we should do something about it kernen not if it cost 30 trillion dimon you can do it cost free that s what i m trying to tell you about carbon tax it goes to a bank and you get it back kernen i understand but there is a certain amount of carbon carbon dioxide that s going to be released for years whether you balance it out and do your carbon offset and feel better about your whatever you came over and fine quick can i just tie it back to where we started this conversation you mention risk mitigation that s what you do very well when you look out there what are the big risk factors since we had a trade one phase deal signed with china and since we know where brexit is headed at this point what are the things that you re watching dimon cyber is a big one you look at our systems vulnerability to cyber and that can be banks water or grids i m not going to talk about geopolitics cause that is always noise that can always cause something that we don t fully understand today i would put the qe it is just in the back of my mind as an abnormal situation that s been going on for a long time and we don t completely understand why the cause and effects and we may not know for other ten years on this particular one and good policy i mean i get frustrated that we don t have better policy around the world and i applaud the politicians that are strong enough to get up and fight the good policy which doesn t always sound like it s good for the citizens but it is so i credit macron i think he s fighting the fight to get france growing better quick i want to thank you for your time it s always a pleasure seeing you we love this interview at davos for more information contact jennifer dauble cnbc t 201 735

completed transactions and growth strategies including possible future acquisitions these statements are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions including those discussed under the sections entitled risk factors and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in first midwest s annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2018 and in first midwest s subsequent filings made with the securities and exchange commission sec these risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive and other sections of these reports describe additional factors that could adversely impact first midwest s business and financial performance non gaap financial information the company s accounting and reporting policies conform to u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap and general practices within the banking industry as a supplement to gaap the company provides non gaap performance results which the company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the company s operating performance these non gaap financial measures include eps adjusted the efficiency ratio return on average assets adjusted tax equivalent net interest income including its individual components tax equivalent net interest margin tax equivalent net interest margin adjusted noninterest expense adjusted effective income tax rate adjusted tangible common equity to tangible assets tangible common equity excluding aoci to tangible assets tangible common equity to risk weighted assets return on average common equity adjusted return on average tangible common equity and return on average tangible common equity adjusted the company presents eps the efficiency ratio return on average assets return on average common equity and return on average tangible common equity all adjusted for certain significant transactions these transactions include acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions all periods delivering excellence implementation costs all periods and certain income tax benefits aligned with tax reform full year 2018 in addition the calculation of the efficiency ratio is adjusted for net oreo expense management believes excluding these transactions from eps the efficiency ratio return on average assets return on average common equity and return on average tangible common equity may be useful in assessing the company s underlying operational performance since these transactions do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods management believes that excluding acquisition and integration related expenses from these metrics may be useful to the company as well as analysts and investors since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size type and structure of each acquisition additionally management believes excluding these transactions from these metrics may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes the company presents noninterest expense adjusted which excludes acquisition and integration related expenses and delivering excellence implementation costs in addition the company presents the effective income tax rate adjusted which excludes certain income tax benefits aligned with tax reform management believes that excluding these items from noninterest expense and the effective income tax rate may be useful in assessing the company s underlying operational performance as these items either do not pertain to its core business operations or their exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods and for peer comparison purposes the tax equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax exempt assets interest income and yields on tax exempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21 management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes in addition management believes that presenting tax equivalent net interest margin adjusted may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes and is useful to the company as well as analysts and investors since acquired loan accretion income may fluctuate based on the size of each acquisition as well as from period to period in management s view tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the company as well as analysts and investors in assessing the company s use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers these non gaap measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution s capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity although intended to enhance investors understanding of the company s business and performance these non gaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap in addition these non gaap financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance see the previously provided tables

this article is more than 4 years old getty first a brief history of financial markets stocks beat bonds over a 25 to 50 year time span volatility of fixed income investments can equal that of equities in both directions the market s p 500 index can sell at book value now at two times book bond yields can range from 1 to even 15 when inflation rages thirty year treasuries currently yield 2 but in 1982 during frb tightening hit 15 five year paper a comparable trajectory inflation now at 2 rose to 8 early eighties it made our country uncompetitive as in general motors dollar depreciation or appreciation can range between minus 25 to plus 25 deep seated financial risk lurks in almost every type of asset banks capitalized at 200 billion can self destruct with hidden bad loans american

flows bedrock investment principles don t own muni paper rated below aa to mitigate interest rate risk keep bond duration averaging under 10 years preferably five years be prepared to hold fixed income investments to maturity don t put more than 25 of assets in below investment grade corporates or in preferred stocks almost all preferred stocks are issued by financial corporations like banks and insurance underwriters at the bottom of the financial meltdown in 2009 bank of america s preferred sold at 5 sinking from its 25 par value citigroup s common stock bottomed at one buck before its 1 for 10 reverse split citi may not see its 2007 high 560 adjusted for the next 50 years if then you need a specialist investment manager for high yield securities they d need to log a risk adjusted return way above investment grade bonds a high yield bond etf is suitable as a passive investment don t retain investment advisors for stock market participation buy index funds from a reputable house like fidelity investments or vanguard make sure their fees all in hold under 20 basis points per annum your mindset must be to hold index funds through a full cycle as long as five 10 even 20 years don t trade in or out the sure way to serfdom and self loathing a conservative mix is half equities half bonds in an historically low interest rate environment today hold bond maturities of no longer than five years if your tax rate is relatively high municipals afford a better after tax return than corporates and treasuries but bb rated bonds with a five year duration are competitive yearend 2019 the stock market yielded under 2 10 year treasury paper 1 8 during minimal inflation stock market valuation can hold at high historical norms in a low interest rate setting markets can levitate in tandem with earnings at approximately 5 to 7 annually but not a given and not forever fixed income investments currently aren t competitive with equity markets the s p 500 index is weighted primarily by large capitalization companies microsoft alphabet and apple at 1 trillion currently their valuation is appropriate for passive but serious investors taking a long term stance on their invested capital i d add facebook too they should remain in your portfolio for the intermediate term remember nasdaq 100 is volatile but 10 of assets here is ok this index appreciated 45 last year don t get involved in whether growth stocks or value paper is preferable in the long run both come out neck n neck avoid emerging market equities and small capitalization stocks which seem best left to intensive stock market operators investing offshore is laden with serious variables not just geopolitical risk but sizable currency exposure foreign accounting standards remain far less rigorous than ours stay away from managers who spread client capital over 20 or more investment categories a themeless pie chart construct that usually underperforms i won t invest in properties where i ve concluded management is not socially responsible or its headman s character is impeachable as warren buffett has written you didn t want to bet against america going back to george washington s presidency no short selling or naked options writing you ll screw up your head and at best break even never wax emotional about what you own nor live in the past consider icons like ibm general electric polaroid eastman kodak and xerox are either gone diminished or discredited remember you re just a number on a broker s ledger give them no discretion over your account and don t listen to his recommendations consider the average life of a growth stock hardly lasts over five years and only 5 hang in for a decade or more your image of a corporation s viability and competitive mettle is probably five to 10 years out of date they don t know you own their stock or love them passionately for their latest car model never forget the street s optimism repeatedly transfers itself into pessimism sometimes practically overnight the forces that created the bull market in bonds are unlikely to change much in coming years i m talking about low commodity prices moderate wage inflation and more punitive individual and corporate taxation that get legislated although the slowdown in economic growth may not be fully discounted it seems manageable in a low interest rate environment avoid mature companies in manufacturing or materials and mining starting with coal steel and aluminum no flow of dividends there can result in a good return to investors considering price earnings ratios here remain in teens we are in the midst of a major positive technological upswing nowhere near maturity re internet e commerce cloud computing and personal computer services the proposed investment construct depending on the need for annualized income maintain 50 or less of investment capital in an index fund such as vanguard or fidelity fees are minimal along with ease of entry and exit for income keep 50 or more of assets in a high yield bond fund where yield is now approximately 5 investment quality should be bb or minimal with duration of portfolio averaging out at five years invesco manages such a fund appropriately diversified with no more than 5 of capital in any one position for exposure to growth stocks at least 10 of your portfolio should be in an etf that captures the nasdaq 100 index this is a volatile construct but gives good exposure to microsoft apple facebook alphabet et al where yield and volatility are not of primary consideration exposure to nasdaq 100 can be increased to 25 while lowering the percentage invested in a standard poor s index fund avoid investment counselors at banks and brokerage houses hedge fund operators et al performance records do run below benchmark goals while fees are at least 1 plus profit participation avoid 2 portfolio fee constructs long term fees detract meaningfully from results particularly avoid wealth management houses that employ pie chart schemata that invest in everything gold oil futures offshore debt equity etc they are long term underperformers the reason for nasdaq 100 exposure is the country remains

former fed official says government can borrow a lot more narayana kocherlakota the former president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis wants you to know the federal government can never borrow too much money our government already borrowed 23 trillion and deficits are expected to exceed 1 trillion per year he knows many americans feel anxious about the federal government going bankrupt and he has a simple solution he just wrote the following in anpublished by bloomberg policy makers and voters often express concern about the level of the federal deficit which topped 1 trillion last year and the national debt now more than 23 trillion but unlike a household that owes money to a bank the u s government has the ability to tax its creditors this power means that the federal government can afford any level of debt that is owed to american taxpayers there you have it government can tax americans for whatever is needed the solution is so simple any dim wit could have come up with it as a matter of fact one did federal reserve bankers have always received unnatural reverence for their wisdom and piety it s refreshing when one of them puts their patently stupid indeed evil ideas on public display the people running our central bank come from the same stock as the liars schemers and sociopaths who run the federal government and wall street the sooner americans figure that out the better toward that end we have some follow up questions for kocherlakota have you considered the track record of nations that borrowed and spent without restraint we can find lots of examples of nations that collapsed when leaders like you arrogantly assumed they could get away with borrowing spending and taxing in confidence destroying amounts what do you expect will happen to the treasury market when your tax is imposed on creditors do you expect them to continue lining up after they discover they must both lend money and then bear the cost of its repayment too what if creditors the people who buy treasuries tend to be better politically connected than people who don t buy treasuries will politicians really impose a massive tax on these people or is it possible they will stick it to the poor and middle class instead when they get cornered and have to raise taxes of course kocherlakota is well aware his cabal of central bankers and politicians is already taxing americans heavily and lying about it the tax is called inflation and it is severely underreported the federal reserve is printing money to buy federal debt officials there pushed interest rates to epic lows and kept them near there for most of a decade as a consequence the federal reserve notes americans saved are worth a lot less the purchasing power was transferred to washington and wall street the recipients of all the monetary stimulus the effect is exactly like income tax and the myriad other federal taxes people pay all that borrowed currency is fueling the massive expansion in government financial services gobble up an ever larger chunk of the nation s gdp and wealth inequality just keeps getting bigger kocherlakota published his solution for unlimited government borrowing in a misguided attempt to put people at ease but have a look at the comment section below the editorial those who gave it a serious read were aghast thank goodness by clint siegner moneymetals com clint siegner is a director at money metals exchange perhaps the nation s fastest growing dealer of low premium precious metals coins rounds and bars siegner a graduate of linfield college in oregon puts his experience in business management along with his passion for personal liberty limited government and honest money into the development of money metals brand and reach this includes writing extensively on the bullion markets and their intersection with policy and world affairs 2020 clint siegner all rights reserved disclaimer the above is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice information and analysis above are derived from sources and utilising methods believed to be reliable but we cannot accept responsibility for any losses you may incur as a result of this analysis individuals should consult with their personal financial advisors 2005 2022 the market oracle is a free daily financial markets analysis forecasting online publication
summary since the 2010s a wide range of separatist movements have represented the main political demands in southern yemen these groups are motivated by their geographical and historical origins backed by various foreign powers and divided by their demands for independence or autonomy the southern transitional council the most prominent separatist group claims to represent the south as a whole but it has limited control over parts of western governorates the 2019 clash between the council and the internationally recognised government poses the most serious threat to the anti houthi coalition since the start of the yemen conflict the implementation of the riyadh agreement is far behind schedule and it is unclear whether saudi arabia will be able to enforce the deal given the uae s withdrawal from yemen the european union should continue to support development and state building in yemen increase its efforts to mediate between yemenis and develop institutional and democratic platforms on which southerners can achieve self determination introduction on 5 november 2019 the internationally recognised government of yemen irg signed the riyadh agreement with the southern transitional council stc separatist group aiming to settle an armed conflict between the sides that had reignited three months earlier when the stc expelled the irg from its temporary capital of aden this outbreak of violence forced the international community to focus on the southern question after it had side lined the issue to deal with the crisis resulting from the houthi takeover of sana a and most of the country s highlands in 2014 foreign powers involved in the broader war in yemen have paid limited attention to southern separatism partly because they all want the country to remain unified yet their approach is unsustainable the war puts the country at risk of disintegration only by addressing the diverse complex challenges that have arisen in southern yemen can the european union succeed in its efforts to create neutral constructive avenues for mediation and development across the country this paper focuses on the origins development and prospects of political challenges in southern yemen it begins with an analysis of historical divisions in the south outlining key issues within specific governorates including the political fragmentation that has occurred since 2015 when the war in yemen first gained an international dimension the paper concludes by examining the significance of the riyadh agreement as well as the implications for the south of current attempts to end the war it argues that eu policymakers need to address the diverse complex problems facing southern yemen if they are to create a sustainable solution to the conflict and makes several recommendations for how they could achieve this the eu should continue to support development and state building in yemen and should increase its efforts to mediate between southerners as well as between southerners and northerners this would promote cooperation and coexistence encouraging the development of institutional and democratic platforms upon which southerners can achieve self determination two decades of the republic of yemen the republic of yemen was formed in 1990 by the merger of the yemen arab republic yar centred on the capital of sana a and the people s democratic republic of yemen pdry which with its capital in aden was the successor to the british colony of aden and the protectorates president ali abdullah saleh rose to power in the yar in 1978 he became president of the republic of yemen at its establishment holding this position until the arab uprisings forced him to resign in 2012 he was replaced by his vice president abd rabbu mansour hadi in a single candidate election under the gulf cooperation council gcc agreement the process received support from not only gcc states but also other major world powers that have an interest in yemen southern separatist movements do not perceive hadi as an ally because he is a southerner who migrated to sana a following the defeat of his faction in an intra pdry struggle in 1986 the two year transition process under the gcc agreement also included a national dialogue conference designed to bring together all the country s political forces and create a consensus solution to the country s myriad political economic and social problems while a majority of its members were southerners the conference was unable to bring some separatist factions to the table as they refused to be part of any discussion that treated the south as part of yemen and demanded that it be recognised as an independent entity based on the pre 1990 border the southern question was one of the many issues that the transition and the national dialogue conference failed to resolve largely due to the obstinacy of and divisions within southern movements the international community including eu countries and the members of the gcc that form the saudi led military coalition intervening in yemen officially recognises the republic of yemen as representative of all yemen including the south it has supported the irg since 2015 when hadi relocated its capital to aden origins of southern movements before independence the territory of interest to southern separatist movements remained under effective british control until independence the area experienced active political opposition to britain s colonial project from the 1950s onwards it was home to a lively trade union movement with links to its uk counterparts and to a lesser extent the british labour party in the 1960s following the overthrow of the imamate in sana a and the establishment of the yar the anti colonial movement intensified in the south it was divided into two rival groups the first of which was the nasserite people s socialist party a group led by abdullah al asnag that gradually morphed into the egyptian backed front for the liberation of occupied south yemen flosy the second movement was the national liberation front which originated within the movement of arab nationalists an organisation that had a tense complex relationship with egyptian president gamal abdel nasser these two movements fought against britain while remaining rivals in 1967 the national liberation front emerged victorious from serious fighting with the flosy the national liberation front s takeover of most of the protectorates territory persuaded britain to negotiate independence with it in summer 1967 before handing control of the country to it the following november the pdry would go on to become the only arab state that openly aligned with the soviet bloc throughout the remaining two decades of the cold war the people s democratic republic of yemen the pdry regime which implemented welfare focused social policies and attempted to create a socialist orientated mixed economy with a strong role for the public and cooperative sectors was characterised by destructive factional infighting it is debatable to what extent these conflicts within the yemeni socialist party resulted from ideological differences or more traditional regional or tribal rivalries during the 23 years of the pdry s existence the regime implemented anti tribal policies and rejected regional allegiances by for example initially numbering rather than naming governorates when the leadership eventually chose names for the governorates it selected ones that referred to geographical or ancient historical entities rather than contemporary social or tribal allegiances the regime also encouraged yemenis to use their fathers and grandfathers first names rather than family or tribal names at the political level it also tried to ensure that people from all parts of the country as well as all social groups were represented in senior positions aiming to include the sada direct descendants of the prophet muhammad tribal groups and those of low status these initiatives however failed to prevent the emergence of bitter internal conflicts that led to the unconstitutional removal of top leaders in 1969 1978 and most prominently 1986 the 1986 conflict was the longest and bloodiest of the three initially a power struggle within the political bureau of the yemeni socialist party the fighting spilled into the streets and developed into a regional conflict individuals were detained or killed on the assumption that the location of their birth determined their allegiance to a particular side as such many observers have described the 1986 conflict as a return to tribalism there is little doubt that an official policy of promoting national rather than regional allegiances cannot change a centuries old culture in just two decades this is particularly true of regional divisions and rivalries as intense as those in the west of the pdry these developments are highly relevant to the situation in yemen in early 2020 as the signatories to the riyadh agreement are largely divided into the same two factions that fought each other in the 1986 conflict today the stc is the successor to the group that went on to rule the pdry for the remaining four years of its existence but whose main leaders were killed in the process mostly originating from the governorates of lahij and dhali on the other side hadi and many of his ministers have roots in the defeated faction whose members originated mainly from abyan and shabwa governorates and who took refuge in sana a after their defeat in 1986 unification and the rise of southern grievances of all the official political slogans in the pdry yemeni unity was the most popular the socialist regime did not attempt to create a southern yemeni national identity but supported the popular concept of the yemeni nation as did the leadership in the yar when unification came in 1990 it was welcomed throughout the country yemenis everywhere looked forward to free movement and a prosperous economy hoping that the positive elements of the political social and economic policies of the two previous regimes would prevail across the unified country southerners however were soon bitterly disappointed the official three year transition period was marked by a rapid decline in living standards in the south with subsidies on basic food commodities coming to an end and prices rising as in practice the riyal immediately replaced the dinar the city of aden was neglected by officials and others who moved to sana a to be closer to the centre of power poor remote rural areas suffered as the government reversed its agrarian reforms more than 20 000 smallholders lost their usufruct rights and were reduced to working as sharecroppers or casual labourers meanwhile the pre independence elite regained their privileges as did other close associates of the saleh regime among the beneficiaries of the new order were families who had become wealthy after migrating to saudi arabia and were willing to invest in the yemeni communities from which they originated the deterioration of relations between the saleh regime and the yemeni socialist party which shared power with him during the transition period was reflected in the assassination or attempted assassination of more than 150 of the party s leaders as well as the increasing recriminations between the two leaderships the 1993 parliamentary election marginalised the yemeni socialist party which was replaced in the new government by the islamist islah party relations between the southern and northern leaderships deteriorated further leading to the 1994 civil war between saleh supporters of unification and factions of the yemeni socialist party that called for the return of the pre 1990 border saleh won this war decisively thanks to the support of exiles from previous conflicts within the south including former members of the military such as hadi his victory led to the ransacking of aden and other towns by islamist fundamentalists including members of former southern regimes fighters who had returned from the jihad in afghanistan and northerners who regarded the south as a hotbed of atheism and communism in the years that followed southerners saw their economic situation deteriorate and their social lives increasingly fall under the influence of conservative religious norms which particularly affected women with political life in the south dominated by islah and saleh s party the general people s congress there was a growing gap between the poor majority and a small minority of wealthy individuals most of them saleh s associates from both the north and the south in this way many people become convinced that the regime was discriminating against the south the development of the southern separatist movement 2007 2017 in 2006 yemeni military and security personnel who had been forced into retirement after 1994 started a movement that initially demanded payment of their pensions seeking the means to achieve a reasonable living standard the saleh regime s brutal suppression of the movement caused it to expand beyond dhali and lahij taking hold in the city of aden and areas such as the eastern governorate of hadhramaut following the outbreak of the arab uprisings in 2011 thousands of yemeni supporters of the movements began calling for political social and economic reforms to improve people s living conditions and reduce inequality southerners joined forces with other yemenis for a short period but after the gcc agreement was signed the separatists grew stronger and other elements of the reform movement weakened with the collapse of the gcc agreement s transition in 2014 and the houthi takeover of sana a hadi s irg attempted to re establish itself in aden the separatists opposed the irg presence in the city partly because there were many northerners in his government this reflected an increasingly violent strain of anti northern prejudice in the south which resulted in the ill treatment of many people of northern origin and their expulsion from aden and neighbouring governorates since the 2010s the main political demands throughout the south have been expressed by a wide range of separatist movements whose only ideological difference concerns whether they demand complete independence or autonomy these movements have undergone significant fragmentation some are led by former rival leaders of the pdry or their sons as is the case of ali salem al beedh and hassan ba um both of whom are from hadhramaut and draw most of their support from that governorate but claim to represent the entire south the movements a mixture of allies and rivals are organised under the supreme council for the peaceful struggle to liberate and restore the south which has taken on slightly different names in the past decade some of the movements such as those led by the al jifri family originated in the colonial period while others have emerged in recent years contributing to the political fragmentation that has characterised yemen since 2015 ali nasser mohammed former president of the pdry and one of many southerners who fled to the north after 1986 has also been active throughout the period holding meetings in various locations although he has supported the establishment of a federal system rather than secession european countries and other foreign powers have unsuccessfully attempted to encourage various separatist movements to reorganise into a manageable number of organisations with clear aims this has involved a series of meetings in abu dhabi amman beirut cairo and various european capitals attended by varying combinations of separatist leaders and their followers the latest of these took place in brussels in december 2019 at best these leaders have committed to attend follow up meetings but they have been consistently unable to agree on even short term programmes or objectives while all of them call for either the autonomy of the south within a unified yemen or the outright return to an independent southern state along the pre 1990 border any high profile announcement of a formal grouping of separatist organisations has promptly led to denials by some of the signatories this disarray results from their lack of fundamental policies none of them has advanced any social economic or other programme beyond the call for separation it also results from their narrow minded self serving objectives which disregard the needs of the wider population including their supporters all of whom are suffering from instability and deep economic problems however since 2017 one faction has come to dominate the national and international discourse on southern separatism the stc an organisation established in april that year by former governor of aden aydaroos al zubaydi and his close allies hani bin breik a former minister without portfolio in hadi s government and shalal shaye hadi had been under pressure from the saudi led coalition particularly the united arab emirates which represented it in aden to give zubaydi and his allies government positions despite their support for separatism and their opposition to hadi s faction in the 1986 conflict hadi did so but rising tensions within the government eventually led him to fire zubaydi and bin breik prompting them to form the stc geopolitical alignments it is misleading to delineate rival southern groups strictly by governorate each of yemen s governorates which were defined by the pdry regime and only slightly modified after unification contains numerous political entities that formed prior to independence particularly in what are now abyan dhali lahij and shabwa political rivalries from the pre independence and pdry days will continue to be a source of instability for years to come and other rivalries have emerged in the three decades since unification moreover support for unification is common among many in the south including not only those from families with mixed backgrounds but also yemenis who work travel and maintain relationships across the country yet as far as much of the outside world is concerned southern separatist movements are now synonymous with the stc this oversimplification of the situation could lead to dangerous policy choices the stc has achieved its international prominence thanks to the uae s strategy in the yemeni crisis one of the two states most responsible for internationalising the civil war in yemen the uae has concentrated its interventions in the country s south after deploying troops to aden in july 2015 and playing a major role in expelling houthi saleh forces from the city the uae led coalition operations in southern governorates prior to the riyadh agreement saudi arabia only participated in these activities as a mediator between uae backed forces and the irg the uae established several organisations designed to provide security in southern governorates security belts in abyan aden dhali lahij and soqotra and elite forces in hadhramaut and shabwa these groups are led by salafists fundamentalist sunnis have been trained and deployed with emirati assistance and are paid directly by the uae although they formally work for the irg they do not answer to yemen s ministry of defence or ministry of the interior in addition to implementing the uae s strategy to undermine islah a party it perceives as linked to the muslim brotherhood in aden and beyond these forces are associated with the stc in western governorates thus the stc can enforce its will through the security belts the stc has established offices in some western capitals and gained access to the services of public relations companies while its commanders travel to meet world leaders and promote its cause this has enabled it to achieve international stature at the expense of the numerous other southern separatist organisations which it has marginalised in the past two years the rivalry between the stc and the irg has intensified culminating in the irg s expulsion from aden in august 2019 the event coincided with the uae s formal withdrawal from aden which left saudi arabia to reconcile the stc with the irg as discussed above due to their fragmentation southern separatist groups have so far been unable to develop common positions or create lasting alliances thus preventing the international community from finding interlocutors among them if international policymakers are to change this they need to understand the various strands of separatism that run through the south in relation to yemen s pre 1990 borders aden as the former capital of the pdry aden was officially named the economic capital of yemen when the country was unified although this was largely a formality as prior to 2015 the government only made brief visits to the city in winter when the weather there is agreeable and is cold in sana a in the fighting of 2015 local resistance forces comprised fighters with a wide range of ideologies and alliances some of whom received considerable support from the uae given aden s position as the interim capital all factions believe it is essential to maintain a public presence there this is particularly relevant for the irg without its aden base it is no more than a government in exile hence saudi arabia s efforts to forge what has become the riyadh agreement since 2015 aden has struggled to become the true capital of the irg this is because hadi and most of his ministers use riyadh as their main base and as such are rarely in aden where most remaining embassies to yemen are located international organisations have their main yemeni offices in sana a and sometimes operate from amman and djibouti maintaining only a minimal presence in aden moreover the relationship between hadi s government and various southern separatist groups in aden has been tense from the beginning few members of local resistance forces recognise hadi s legitimacy as president as most are aligned with the separatists the uneasy alliance between the sides lasted until 2017 when hadi dismissed zubaydi as governor of aden an indicator of the balance of power in the city is the position of shaye who retained his post after zubaydi s dismissal nominally answering to the irg until 12 august 2019 when his allies in the stc expelled the hadi government from aden he was eventually dismissed in mid august 2019 after the stc had taken over aden but in early 2020 appears to remain actively involved in addition to being the main site of conflict between the irg and the stc aden also suffers from considerable insecurity caused by struggles between various forces in particular the security belt and other stc linked salafist forces have in line with the wishes of their emirati sponsors frequently launched attacks on individuals associated with rival political groups mainly islah the uae and the stc publicly describe these attacks as anti jihadist thereby conflating islah followers with members of al qaeda or the islamic state group isis with the help of these local forces the uae has allegedly maintained secret prisons throughout the region in which it has tortured detainees and held them without trial for lengthy periods moreover the uae has allegedly hired foreign mercenary groups to assassinate islah members and other perceived enemies the confusing political situation in aden reflects the city s complex history particularly its role as a focal point for migration in the last century in addition to being a destination for rural yemenis seeking job opportunities aden has also been the main port from which yemenis migrated people came to aden from the protectorates the imamate and the yar creating the basis for a very mixed society one that it is far more liberal than other parts of yemen as well as an intellectual and political centre these factors make the xenophobic attacks against northerners in aden all the more jarring shabwa and abyan during the pdry s internal conflicts groupings in shabwa and abyan often fought alongside against those in lahij but also competed with one another for example the 1978 conflict pitted factions from lowland coastal abyan against those of the midland jol plateau shabwa s marib balhaf gas pipeline and small oil fields aside both governorates are economically dependent on agriculture and artisanal fisheries the governorates are mostly inhabited by tribal people and include significant numbers of farmers from low status groups after aden shabwa and abyan are the main focus of conflict between the stc and the government one of the many indicators that the stc is dominated by leaders and receives most of its support from lahij and dhali shabwa is strategically important because it is adjacent to al bayda and marib and is a key access point for eastern governorates such as hadhramaut and al mahrah the stc and the irg blame each other for attempting to take control of shabwa s hydrocarbons shabwa s elite force a group trained by the uae with the ostensible goal of protecting the governorate from jihadist groups remained active until september 2019 when the irg drove its 6 000 fighters out of most of the governorate by early 2020 the irg controlled most if not all of shabwa partly with the help of the most influential figures there including mohamed saleh bin adyu governor of shabwa and general ali bin rashid al harthi whom the us accuses of being a member of al qaeda in 2017 shabwa experienced more us raids against al qaeda than any other governorate abyan was home to one of the first strongholds al qaeda established in yemen as well as of some of the first jihadist organisations established in yemen such as the aden abyan islamic army in 2012 extremist militants took over two districts in abyan ja ar and zinjibar prompting the government to launch a military campaign to retake the areas in 2015 some of coastal abyan temporarily came under jihadist influence once again but most of the governorate is now under stc control abd al latif al sayed leader of the abyan security belt and allegedly a former member of al qaeda has survived four assassination attempts since he defected to the stc in 2017 his men control much of ja ar zinjibar and parts of ahwar the fact that sayed received medical treatment paid for by the uae after one assassination attempt indicates his value to the saudi led coalition although that value has fallen since then due to a conflict in abyan between his forces and those led by the uae minister of interior ahmed al maisari asked sayed to join the irg after the last round of fighting between the irg and the stc in august 2019 but so far he has remained loyal to his gulf patrons in contrast to shabwa abyan has only a small islah presence abu bakr hussein salem who was appointed governor of abyan in 2017 is one of the few islah backed irg figures who has retained a degree of influence there since the stc s partial takeover of the governorate lahij and dhali dhali governorate was established in 1998 when the government merged a small section of lahij with parts of ibb taiz and al bayda dhali and lahij formerly included numerous micro states they are economically dependent on small scale agriculture artisanal fisheries and emigration through remittances and investment their inhabitants who are mainly tribal formed the bulk of the military and security forces of the pdry the hirak the umbrella name for southern separatist groups was established in dhali in 2006 as the association of retired military security and civilian personnel the association was led by general nasser al nobah abdu al maatari and salah al shanfari until 2017 when nobah began to lead it from aden he maintained this role until the stc captured the city nobah sided with hadi during the stc takeover while maatari and shanfari both started their own separatist movements in dhali where they continue to compete with the group with little success the western part of lahij is home to sheikh hamdi shukry al subaihy leader of the subaiha resistance against the houthis and of his own separatist grouping which is made up of salafist fighters he is one of the commanders of the giants brigade a force the uae created and has extensively supported although a separatist he opposes the stc and is popular among salafists his influence extends across al subaiha lahij and dhali are now the heartlands of the stc despite the fact that on paper at least its leadership includes individuals from all governorates this is partly because most of the group s top commanders come from dhali yet even within the two governorates there are a significant number of fighters who are not part of the stc or its security belts the stc only has full control of the district of dhali central and southern parts of lahij and areas of western abyan near the coast in 2019 other areas of dhali which were formerly part of the yar became a front in the conflict between the irg and the houthis the stc has no interest in northern dhali but the houthis while fighting along the 1967 borders hope to control all of yemen hadhramaut until the establishment of the pdry hadhramaut was divided between the kathiri and qu ayti sultanates it is yemen s largest governorate and has a diverse population the sada have played a major economic and political role there in contrast to other governorates tribal groups in hadhramaut are based mainly on the jol and coastal plains although the sada and tribal groups own the governorate s agricultural land members of low status groups do most of the farming there people in the governorate have long standing ties to saudi arabia and south east asia thanks to migration in the last century and the nineteenth century respectively some members of the diaspora have become very wealthy and since unification invested in the governorate the governorate s oil income has in the past not directly benefited hadhramis causing some resentment hadhramaut effectively has three different sub areas the first of these is the coastal region centring on the capital of mukalla which al qaeda took over in 2015 and the government recaptured a year later while the uae claimed this as a major victory for its fighters and the hadhrami elite force the transfer of control was a negotiated event in which al qaeda fighters withdrew with the weapons and other loot they had acquired the second sub area is the remote sparsely populated and inaccessible jol across which jihadist groups are dispersed and from which they launch occasional attacks the third sub area is the agriculturally wealthy wadi dry water course whose capital is seiyun politically this area is currently aligned with the irg there are few separatist forces in the wadi where islah is powerful and controls a considerable number of seats in the yemeni parliament largely thanks to support among the low status agricultural community and the work of its charitable institutions some of its one time supporters have moved on to a more extreme form of islamism in recent years al qaeda and isis have carried out assassinations in qatn shibam and seiyun usually targeting yemen army and coalition figures most of these attacks occur in broad daylight thereby brazenly undermining the authority of the state in northern hadhramaut the irg s military forces including those in al abr military base al khasha and bin ayfan which is 40km west of al qatn are under the command of vice president ali mohsen al ahmar the presence of islah and jihadists in remote areas has generated some speculation among locals and some terrorism experts that they may cooperate with one another the most influential islahi figure in the wadi is salah batais who currently resides in turkey along with many islahi figures other powerful leaders there include sheikh abdullah saleh al kathiri a member of the former ruling family and currently an adviser to hadi and sheikh awadh bin salem bin munif al jabri a tribal leader widely respected in both the wadi and the jol all of them oppose the separatists although they are likely more committed to hadhramaut than to the yemeni state as a whole there is a real possibility of increased tension between supporters of sufi traditions and recently established salafist movements islah and jihadist groups sufis have a particularly important presence in tarim home to dar al mustafa a famous sufi establishment that attracts many foreign students this emergence of extremist salafist groups in the area poses an existential threat to tarim s diverse social fabric rich cultural identity and prominent families it has the potential to exacerbate sectarianism in hadhramaut and further erode religious tolerance throughout the country meanwhile supporters of former sultanates are one of several groups that have made attempts to restore their influence in the governorate reviving a range of old rivalries in coastal areas where the state had been largely absent since 2011 the hadhrami elite force was welcomed by locals and the governor as providers of security and stability there were obvious incentives for locals to join this force as it pays higher salaries than the yemen army comprising an estimated 11 000 fighters the force provides the stc with a presence in coastal hadhramaut the area is currently under the authority of governor faraj suleiman al bahsani who was appointed in 2017 although he was recommended by the saudis bahsani has a reputation that has encouraged locals to accept hadi s authority bahsani and his deputy are primarily loyal to hadhramaut rather than the irg or the uae backed stc but he has maintained good diplomatic ties with both abu dhabi and riyadh since 2017 hadhrami politicians in yemen and the diaspora have planned a hadhramaut inclusive conference on the future of their governorate a gesture of unity that has brought influential figures of various backgrounds together they held a series of preparatory meetings but the conference itself was prematurely abandoned shortly after the first day s meeting nonetheless the organisation has grown in strength actively promoting concerns specific to hadhramaut under the leadership of amr bin habrish chief sheikh of the militarily important hamum tribe and since 2019 deputy governor the conference s secretary general is tarek al akrabi who officially represents it in riyadh ahmed ba mu alim a representative of beedh s separatist faction and a close ally of the stc has joined the conference while maintaining good relationships with other hadhrami figures the positive nature of this relationship has generated speculation that the saudis and the emiratis may now support the conference s efforts to maintain peace in the governorate the organisation remains engaged with public life in hadhramaut funding economic and environmental projects such as initiatives for children it also has offices in both the wadi and on the coast the conference has gained popular support due to its ability to unite a diverse set of hadhrami figures within the governorate and beyond although there are differences between the hadhramaut inclusive conference and bahsani over the future of the governorate he has also strengthened his ties with hadhramis by advocating for popular initiatives for instance he has called for hadhramaut to retain 20 percent of its oil revenues threatening to halt oil production if the government rejects this demand in this way both the governor and the conference are attempting to protect hadhrami interests while maintaining good relations with the leaders of the saudi led coalition in mukalla the stc and bahsani endeavour to remain on good terms with each other as the city hosts the largest and most active stc presence in the governorate notable stc figures in hadhramaut include general ahmed bin breik a former governor of hadhramaut and a former member of the general people s congress but no relation to stc vice president hani bin breik and aqil al attas a member of the stc s presidential council and a former islah supporter many influential figures in hadhramaut seek to remain neutral in the current war as they advocate for local hadhrami concerns however for hadhramis neutrality can be dangerous hakam saleh bin ali thabet al nahdi a former supporter of the general people s congress may have suffered a personal cost for his neutrality in 2018 when his son was killed many hadhramis feel that the killing was meant to warn neutral leaders to pick a side al mahrah al mahrah is the second largest but least populated yemeni governorate with barely 120 000 inhabitants it is also the most remote one as a result of which its population has historically maintained stronger relationships with abu dhabi muscat and riyadh than with sana a its population is composed mainly of tribespeople and low status farming and fishing communities of various origins those living in the eastern part of the governorate have close ties to oman s dhofar governorate its culture including its himyari language was significantly different from that of the rest of the country but it has largely become yemenised in the past five decades the saudi led coalition has accused the houthis of smuggling weapons through al mahrah which has long served as a hub for trafficking more broadly the coalition claims that its intervention in yemen focuses on preventing iran from smuggling weapons to the houthis via oman despite the fact that most of this activity centres on direct sea routes to the eastern regions of yemen and lacks any connection to oman this justification for saudi and emirati intervention in al mahrah s affairs has drawn the relatively peaceful governorate into the international discourse on yemen s war the current situation in al mahrah is shaped by the same factors that prevail elsewhere in the south including political and tribal rivalries as well as foreign powers ambitions to capitalise on the fragmentation of the yemeni state since the beginning of the war riyadh and abu dhabi have vied for control of al mahrah in 2018 saudi arabia took the lead in the governorate where it is widely believed to be planning to build an oil pipeline that would free it from dependence on the strait of hormuz the saudi authorities have taken over the port of nishtun whose capacity they are increasing the war has also increased the importance of trade routes that cross yemen s land borders indeed shehen border post has developed into a flourishing town and an important link to the country customs and other duties collected there generate a significant income for the governorate however in august 2018 the saudi authorities compelled the mahri administration to raise customs duties by 70 percent and to reject customs documents issued in the oman free trade zone measures intended to undermine trade between oman and the governorate oman views these moves as having brought the war closer to its border the country wishes to maintain its strong ties to and its influence in al mahrah due to the close tribal relations between dhofaris and mahris muscat is also concerned that the saudi presence there may foment extremism on oman s border particularly after the recent opening of a salafist school in sayhut in the west of the governorate competition between states neighbouring yemen and the funding they provide to their respective supporters has created tension among mahris islah has a presence in al mahrah and as in other governorates this is strongest among low status social groups saudi arabia successfully pressured the yemeni authorities to appoint its ally strongman rajeh bakrit as governor of al mahrah in november 2017 so far he has tried to accommodate all powers within the governorate and the wider region he replaced mohammed bin kuddoh who was closer to both oman and the uae despite the rivalry between these two states the most popular political entity in the governorate is the general council of the sons of al mahrah and soqotra headed by sultan abdullah bin isa al afrar a member of the family that ruled the sultanate of mahrah and qishn until its abolition in 1967 since its inception in 2012 the council s main goal has been to create a federal region within the borders of the former sultanate the council seeks to restore the sultanate s linguistic cultural social geographical and historical independence and homogeneity as well as to increase its own role in political decision making in al mahrah after its historical exclusion and political marginalisation in october 2019 as tensions between the stc and the irg grew the southern salvation council formed by drawing together the anti coalition group the youth of al mahrah led by sheikh ali salem al hurayzi and elements of the southern hirak including ba um hurayzi has strong tribal connections in both the north and the south while ba um has been a leader of the separatist movement since it first emerged although ba um later withdrew from the southern salvation council the organisation remains popular as it opposes saudi arabia s policy of controlling the governorate indirectly through development and relief projects as well as its military presence the council also opposes emirati involvement in the governorate and unlike most southern movements supports yemeni unity while the southern salvation council and the general council fundamentally disagree about the future of al mahrah they are united in their opposition to foreign intervention like hadhramaut al mahrah has been relatively successful in avoiding violent conflict due to the formation of tribal and technocratic alliances based on notions of a shared apolitical identity soqotra soqotra is a world heritage site occupying a strategically important position between the gulf of aden and the arabian sea yet there are no naval bases in soqotra as the islands are essentially inaccessible for around four months a year during the monsoon season mainly thanks to international interest in its unique ecology as well as decades of migration to the uae the islands 60 000 inhabitants are increasingly connected to the outside world soqotri migration to the uae in the past century has been an important factor with most migrants going to ajman where they have become very wealthy relative to the situation at home these close connections have enhanced emirati influence on the islands the conflict in soqotra has become a microcosm of the broader war between the irg and the uae two administrations now compete for control of the islands as the uae has increased its military intervention and development projects there saudi arabia has attempted to mediate the confrontation between emirati and irg forces with some success for example in may 2018 when then yemeni prime minister ahmed bin dagher refused to leave soqotra unless emirati forces withdrew from the islands saudi mediation facilitated the departure of some uae troops abu dhabi later strengthened its presence there by sending in stc fighters in october 2019 saudi arabia began a new mediation effort after the stc refused to hand over the headquarters of the security department to the head of security in the governorate recently appointed by hadi earlier in the year the irg accused the emiratis of training scores of separatist fighters and sending them to soqotra the uae s control over the islands is reflected in the fact that it continues to issue tourist visas to those travelling on direct flights to soqotra an initiative that the soqotri and irg authorities oppose the stc s strongman in soqotra is yahya mubarak saeed who coordinated the emirati recruitment initiatives and attempted to establish a soqotri elite forces akin to those in hadhramaut and shabwa saeed with the help of emirati officer khalfan mubarak al mazrouei continues to call for protests against irg backed governor ramzy mahrous issa salem bin yaqut an oman based senior sheikh of soqotra continues to campaign ferociously against the uae s presence condemning it in testimony before the us congress in october 2019 in brief in early 2020 all yemeni political parties and tendencies now have supporters in soqotra and loyalties on the islands are therefore divided between yemeni factions the uae and soqotra itself the riyadh agreement on 5 november 2019 the stc and the irg signed the riyadh agreement in the presence of hadi saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman and emirati crown prince mohammed bin zayed the deal followed an outbreak of fighting in august 2019 when the security belts and other uae backed stc militias took control of aden there had also been several earlier clashes between stc forces and the saudi backed irg particularly in aden in january 2018 and in soqotra throughout 2018 and 2019 as in some of the cases discussed above saudi arabia led the mediation efforts that culminated in the agreement the deal formalises the transfer of the coalition s military presence in southern yemen from the uae to saudi arabia a process that in practice dates back to june 2019 when the uae announced its withdrawal from the yemen conflict leaving only a few of its military personnel behind in coastal hadhramaut shabwa and soqotra and in control of the bab al mandab in 2019 not only had houthi control of the northern part of yemen progressed and their incursions and missile launches against saudi arabia increased but the implementation of the un sponsored stockholm agreement signed in december 2018 stalled while tensions with iran also significantly worsened in this context the irg s loss of aden as its interim capital presented a serious threat to the legitimacy of the government and undermined the saudi led coalition it was therefore imperative for saudi arabia to re establish the irg in the city khaled bin salman recently appointed as saudi deputy minister of defence undertook major mediation efforts designed to impose an agreement on the stc and the irg this initiative to legitimise the hadi government required cooperation from saudi arabia s emirati allies which judging by events in the months that followed the signing of the agreement has been only partially forthcoming the agreement calls for the formation of a new aden based government made up of 12 southern and 12 northern ministers the previous administration included a higher proportion of southerners and a larger total number of ministers both sides military and security personnel are to be withdrawn from yemen s cities alongside their heavy military equipment emirati backed militias are to be integrated into the yemeni armed forces under the authority of the ministry of defence while other security services are to operate under the ministry of the interior the leadership of the two ministries is due to change meanwhile the new government will activate all state institutions in the various liberated provinces and work on the payment of salaries and financial benefits to employees of all military sectors under the agreement all state financial resources are to be managed through the aden based central bank of yemen and to be accountable to parliament this clause is likely to be unpopular for two reasons firstly some governorates marib hadhramaut and shabwa have taken control of part of their oil revenues and secondly separatists have prevented parliament from meeting in aden the implementation of the agreement will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and compromise between not only saudi arabia and the uae but also between yemeni factions as recent history suggests this may be beyond the capacity and will of the parties which have thus far demonstrated no commitment to peace or the welfare of yemeni civilians there have already been significant delays in the process and there are doubts that it will succeed in 2020 as southern governorates appear to be more firmly divided than ever between areas under the control of the irg and the stc respectively an indication of problems to come and a major threat to the riyadh agreement as a whole emerged on 18 january when a missile attack killed more than 100 members of the presidential guard unit who were stationed at a military camp in marib and due to be redeployed to aden while the irg blamed the houthis for the attack tensions between the irg and the stc may well be connected to the incident particularly given statements zubaydi made to agence france presse only a few days earlier the agreement is to be implemented under the supervision of a committee established by the coalition which given the uae withdrawal is dominated by the saudis this raises concerns about the sovereignty of the yemeni state and the irg the arrangement is reminiscent of the power given in 2011 to the gcc agreement which contributed to the disintegration of yemen the riyadh agreement also shares other characteristics with similar arrangements in yemen a combination of imprecise implementation mechanisms unrealistic deadlines and idealistic sequencing however should direct saudi houthi negotiations succeed the threat to yemeni sovereignty may recede as the houthis are highly unlikely to allow yemen to become a saudi protectorate moreover the riyadh agreement is a distraction from the coalition s long term goal of restoring the irg to power throughout yemen and driving the houthis out of their strongholds the lack of a meaningful us response to the september 2019 missile attack on saudi aramco s facilities persuaded riyadh that washington would not retaliate against tehran on its behalf this prompted saudi leaders to seek to negotiate a ceasefire and settlement with the houthis contributing to their efforts to push for the riyadh agreement on 20 november 2019 at the annual gcc summit king salman of saudi arabia publicly voiced his hope that the riyadh agreement would pave the way for a larger settlement between domestic yemeni actors indicating that the saudi government had shifted towards recognising that the houthis presence in yemeni politics would endure one obstacle to the implementation of the riyadh agreement is its inability to resolve the fundamental disagreement between the irg and the stc the former seeks to maintain yemen s unity while the latter s existence is predicated on calls for the secession of the south to be effective the agreement which is exclusively tailored to resolving the dispute between the irg and the stc must somehow elide the fact that it is based on recognition of a unified yemen another problem with the deal is that it ignores all other separatist groups given the complex political economic and historical factors discussed above the agreement does not provide a holistic long term solution to either the southern question or to the yemeni crisis as a whole the deal also depends on the uae s willingness to prioritise its relations with saudi arabia over its support for the stc in recent months there have been indications that the stc is weaker than it claims as it has lost military control of all areas aside from those that are home to its main leaders the organisation also refused to participate in the latest internationally sponsored meeting designed to help southerners reach a consensus held in brussels in december 2019 the stc even denounced sheikh saleh bin farid al awlaqi who was formerly their chief ally in shabwa governorate and who has shown considerable flexibility in his alignments in recent decades for taking part in the meeting thus deep hostility between the stc and the hadi government and the exclusion of other southern political groups from the riyadh agreement suggests that widespread praise for the deal may well be misplaced the parties should learn from the stockholm agreement which was signed more than a year ago to loud international praise but has been very partially implemented the only real achievement of that deal has been to establish a patchy military ceasefire in hudayda city one that has not extended to other parts of the governorate conclusion and recommendations within the south there are numerous groups separated both by perceived identities and by competition over the region s sparse natural resources these groups are not defined by residence in the current governorates but by different factors their allegiance is first to the memory of the national entities of aden and the protectorates and second to new political institutions and movements that emerged in the decades since unification for example in wadi hadhramaut there is now a political entity covering areas that were once part of both the kathiri and qu ayti states but are unified thanks to a broad allegiance of low status supporters of islah as a result they form a significant part of the irg s military forces under the leadership of vice president ali mohsen al ahmar further west the alignments of the 1986 conflict largely overlap with the current rivalry between the irg and the stc strategically important sparsely populated al mahrah is forced to deal with many external claims on its territory although shabwa has some hydrocarbon resources and the marib balhaf gas pipeline these assets do not provide significant employment for its population further west abyan lahij and dhali formerly part of the pdry have few natural resources and a largely poor population that has for centuries sustained itself through migration and raiding the conflicts between the historical micro states contained within these governorates are likely to re emerge in a new form indeed these governorates now provide most of the troops and leaders of salafist forces the uae has trained and deployed meanwhile the internationalisation of the yemen conflict and the interests of the two main leaders of the coalition add another dimension to these rivalries for instance the situation in al mahrah has been shaped by saudi arabia s determination to achieve one of its long term strategic objectives bypassing the constraints imposed by its reliance on the strait of hormuz which threaten its access to the high seas for energy trade similarly the uae s support for the stc in aden and other ports is designed to develop emirati maritime supremacy along the coasts of the arabian peninsula as well as to exert influence over a rival to the irg and thus to oppose islah foreign military interventions in the past decade have deepened yemen s devastating humanitarian crisis and accelerated the administrative failures of both de facto and internationally recognised local authorities these exogenous initiatives increase yemeni dependency on external agencies while undermining the capacity of local actors and institutions to develop their own mechanisms for dealing with the situation the war has exacerbated the political fragmentation of the south and southern separatists have proven unable to overcome their factional rivalries or develop strategies that address the population s social economic and political development problems they offer no programme that generates support outside the region they represent and therefore are susceptible to foreign influence while the south is torn between a multiplicity of diverging movements and separatist claims the houthis are running a tight ship in the areas they control hoping to extend their governance model across the whole country although their ideology is widely abhorred the houthis offer the kind of strong centralised control that some people long for just as many yemenis opposed the socialist regime but respected it for imposing law and order and for its broader organisational capabilities they may see the benefits of houthi rule particularly given the chaos within the irg fragmentation can be tempting as the tihami and other groups demonstrated in the national dialogue conference allowing one political entity to claim special rights to a specific region only encourages others to follow suit in this complex and risky environment european policymakers should be careful to avoid actions likely to further fragment yemen and its south in particular the country needs a strong but sensitive new government that the citizenry who have come to see the force of arms as the authorities main form of control view as just and legitimate in designing and implementing interventions foreign powers must take into consideration the historical geopolitical economic and social nuances of southern yemen in the search of a settlement to end the war the eu and other members of the international community should work to restore a sense of nationhood within yemen to this end they should launch projects and other activities designed to reduce social tension between southerners and northerners the eu should assist yemeni parties in engaging in internal discussions on the future of the south within a united yemen providing them with a stronger and more durable opportunity for autonomy through a democratic process the policy of supporting yemen as a unified state is important to prevent future strife as the alternative is to allow the country to disintegrate into a multitude of mutually antagonistic resource poor micro states a phenomenon that would be particularly apparent in the south there the only area that has enough economic resources and political stability to operate independently is hadhramaut and hadhramis have already made it abundantly clear that they would not accept being integrated into a southern state along the pre 1990 borders the ambition of the stc and other southern separatist groups to re establish a southern state is unrealistic for several reasons given the considerable growth in population in recent decades most of these entities would be economically unviable yemenis can only address their enormous problems including those created by climate change and water scarcity through cooperation within a national strategy moreover such an attempt would exacerbate resentments originating in the numerous armed conflicts between the rival political entities discussed above leading to further violence other tensions are also likely to emerge in hadhramaut the significant social tensions between tribes the sada and low status agricultural workers are likely to increase in the face of rising sectarianism in contrast a well designed and carefully managed federal state could help heal these wounds without generating new grievances regional divisions within such a state should be based on social cohesion and equity of natural resources and economic potential rather than bureaucratic convenience dialogue between southern political entities based on the social and economic situation of the areas they control must continue yet as demonstrated by the failures of the eu and others to promote this dialogue in the past decade a new approach is necessary rather than bringing together existing factions and political parties future dialogue should focus on social and economic development issues seeking to identify programmes to solve the daily problems faced by the population here the eu could sponsor a series of meetings and research initiatives covering various sectors efforts to restructure yemen administratively and politically should be based on a series of specific discussions of the country s basic developmental problems in areas such as water education natural resources agriculture and social cohesion detailed analysis of and proposals on these sectoral issues could form the basis of further dialogue and eventually a framework for a federal structure that redraws the boundaries of each region ideally this process should be led by technical experts rather than partisan actors with the aim of devising solutions based on development potential rather than individual concerns such an approach would redefine southern regions based on their economic and political viability rather than factional interests and could contribute to restoring a sense of common identity and solidarity rather than the mutual hostility that is the characteristic

with the phase one trade deal behind them the united states and china will now probably shift attention to sorting out their economic and trade relationships with europe caught in the middle of the us china trade war and geopolitical competition the european union eu has tried to steer an independent course balancing security and geopolitical concerns with economic and business needs doing so however has exposed many differences vis a vis the united states as well as china such as europe s criticism of the phase one deal as not going to be good for competitiveness and jobs the new geopolitical european commission as president ursula von der leyen has characterized her administration will have to navigate these vexing problems both externally in asserting its own identity and perhaps more importantly internally in forging a consensus among eu members allowing it to do so the eu and the united states the disagreements between brussels and washington seem to multiply all the time us president donald j trump s skeptical attitude toward the eu europe treats us worse than china as well his administration s willingness to use hardball tactics to put pressure on european allies threatening to impose 25 percent tariffs on european autos if the uk germany and france don t call out iran has made overcoming these differences even harder against these headwinds a recent visit to washington by the eu s new trade commissioner phil hogan may offer a glimmer of hope in the shape of a tripartite agreement with the united states and japan demanding serious world trade organization wto reform to deal with china s subsidy of its state owned enterprises soes however it should be noted that for the three ganging up on china is the lowest of the low hanging fruits nevertheless that breakthrough seems to have been boosted by a truce reached on january 19 by french president emmanuel macron and trump to avert a tariff war on digital taxation france has agreed to delay the collection of its digital services tax dst and washington agreed to not impose retaliatory tariffs of up to 100 percent on 2 4 billion of french goods until the end of 2020 to give time for the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd sponsored multilateral negotiations for an international agreement on digital taxation to bear fruit the unified approach proposal released by the oecd last october tries to combine the three main ideas currently under discussion and therefore can be expected to ease the deadlock which had frustrated many countries and led some such as france the uk italy and austria to adopt their own versions of dst the france us truce can serve as a template to deal with the remaining threats of us tariffs on other countries adopting dsts the situation is fluid and needs to be monitored meanwhile attention has also focused on other trade disputes washington has already imposed 10 percent tariffs on large european civil aircrafts and 25 percent tariffs on selected farm and other goods worth 7 5 billion consistent with the wto s authorization of measures in response to eu subsidies for airbus the trump administration has also planned to hike tariff rates to 100 percent following the wto s ruling on december 2 2019 against the eu claim of having stopped providing subsidies to airbus a decision on the tariff increase may come any time after the public comment period has ended on january 13 2020 such an increase could influence the way the eu determines its own tariffs on us goods after the wto assesses damages caused by the state tax breaks enjoyed by boeing the eu is unhappy with the us airbus tariffs but cannot appeal since the wto appellate body has been rendered inoperative another growing irritant is the eu plan to introduce a carbon border tax on imports from countries deemed not having sufficiently strong climate policies the aim is to maintain an even playing field for european producers having to buy carbon allowances such a tax will likely be contested as a violation of wto rules as well as provoke retaliation by affected countries such as the united states to further complicate matters macron has declared that france will not sign a trade agreement with any country not adhering to the paris climate agreement which the united states has formally withdrawn from also poisoning the atmosphere is a plethora of us sanctions many of which affect the eu most direct are us sanctions on companies working on the nord stream ii gas pipelines to prevent increasing european dependency on russian energy supplies this has caused allseas a swiss dutch company to suspend laying pipes in the remaining 100 miles of the project furthermore washington has recently expanded sanctions on iran to cover the construction mining manufacturing and textiles industries raising the risk of secondary sanctions on european companies doing any business with iran in particular if europe s instex an arrangement designed to offset eu companies export and import to iran bypassing payments through the banking system becomes operational it would further irritate the united states last but not least the us campaign to exclude chinese telecom giant huawei from participating in building out 5g infrastructures has put many eu countries in a difficult position to prevent a further deterioration of the situation it is crucial that the eu and united states agree on an agenda to start trade talks this has so far been elusive as washington insists on including agriculture while the european commission just wants to discuss industrial goods constrained by the mandate given to it by eu members unhappy with the large goods trade surplus the eu has with the united states 2019 will exceed the 169 billion posted in 2018 trump has threatened tariffs on eu cars and car parts on national security grounds to break the stalemate he repeated these threats at this year s world economic forum meeting at davos even though his authority to impose tariffs under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 lapsed after the november 14 2019 deadline he can initiate a section 301 trade act of 1974 investigation with broader scope into alleged unfair practices by the eu in the auto trade laying the basis for tariffs developments on this front will determine the fate of eu us trade tensions the eu and china an important goal this year for the eu and china is to complete the comprehensive agreement on investment in time for the summit of leaders from both sides scheduled for september in leipzig germany holding the presidency of the eu in the second half of 2020 hopes to present a unified 27 1 approach to china at the summit in an effort to counter china s divide and conquer tactics since 2012 china has developed a framework to cooperate with central and eastern european countries called 16 1 recently extended to 17 1 with the addition of greece complementing its dealings with the eu indeed to send a message of its preference prime minister li keqiang will host the eu china summit in beijing on march 30 31 but president xi jinping will host the 17 1 summit two weeks thereafter in addition despite opposition by the european commission twenty four european countries many of them eu members have signed memorandums of understanding mous with china s belt and road initiative bri despite the controversy associated with numerous bri projects elsewhere the success of greece s port of piraeus which since the sovereign debt crisis has increased its cargo volume more than five times under the management and ownership of cosco china ocean shipping corporation to become the 6th largest cargo port in europe serves as an advertisement to european countries hungry for infrastructure investment moreover the eu must expect that beijing will push back on the declaration of china as an economic competitor and systemic rival in the eu 2020 strategic agenda as well as the new eu policy on screening foreign investments aimed at china since then various senior chinese officials have warned of serious trade and other consequences of bad decisions especially in the possible exclusion of huawei in this context it is interesting to see how china reacts to the eu joining up with the united states and japan to demand wto reforms to deal with china s soe subsidies in short with the us china trade war held in a standstill for the moment the eu s pending economic and trade problems with both countries will command center stage this year hung tran is a nonresident

president donald trump s much discussed phase one trade deal with china sets aside some of the economic uncertainty that has generated market volatility and depressed business investment but trade experts say it falls far short of justifying a globally damaging trade war between the world s two largest economies what s more this resolution could mean higher costs for u s companies and consumers while threatened tariffs on finished consumer goods such as clothes and electronics were avoided the deal also reaffirmed the white house s commitment to tariffs as an enforcement mechanism leaving in place sanctions on 370 billion worth of chinese imports for the foreseeable future this gives american buyers of those goods primarily parts for items made in the u s a greater degree of certainty in their input costs albeit not in the direction they wanted trade analysts said this means companies facing higher input costs would probably begin passing those along to consumers in the form of higher prices if they had not done so already as tariffs become semi permanent chinese producers and u s retailers will have even more reason to pass on price increases said peter petri a professor of international finance at the brandeis international business school overall petri called the deal signed wednesday a valuable agreement saying this is a fragile truce but it s an opportunity for confidence building but he also added several caveats it stopped the downward spiral of retaliations but it is less than what its supporters claim he said some of its provisions are vague and some are unachievable other experts were less impressed i m just underwhelmed said michael o moore professor of economics and international affairs at george washington university i think most people will give a sigh of relief that it s not going to get worse but the real issues remain some said the white house gained nothing by blowing up a nearly completed agreement last spring compared to the may 2019 deal is much thinner and does not entail a long list requirements for china to change its domestic laws and regulations said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics the trump administration made much of the agricultural purchase concessions in the deal but while the consensus was that the u s agricultural sector will likely be a key beneficiary experts were skeptical that china could or would meet the target of importing an additional 200 billion worth of american goods and services including an additional 80 billion in agricultural purchases over two years above pre trade war levels this requires a 40 percent increase this year and another 40 percent increase in 2021 that seems like a stretch goal said david dollar a senior fellow at the brookings institution it s redistributing income from one group of firms to another one in a very complex way it s not obvious it s a benefit for the u s economy he said with no specific dollar targets per agricultural commodity farmers won t know how many soybeans to plant or pigs to raise making them potentially unable to fulfill much larger orders and petri pointed out that the deal s verbiage gives china wiggle room chinese officials say that they will buy u s goods based on market demand but demand won t grow that fast on its own he said to get such spectacular growth china would have to create massive subsidies for u s goods a huge government intervention that we should not be asking for petri said creating government sanctioned demand at that scale could raise the price of those goods and distort the market some said china also risked running afoul of world trade organization regulations against countries playing favorites with their trading partners in short what was a large and steadily growing market for u s commodity producers in china has now become and will remain highly politicized and hence risky for u s farmers kirkegaard said purchase guarantees weren t deemed the only questionable part of the deal provisions meant to hold china accountable for infractions such as forced technology transfers were anemic according to people who analyzed the text on trade secrets to be honest the language that s in the agreement is pretty loose and generic said harry g broadman managing director at berkeley research group who chairs the firm s emerging markets practice on the face of it i don t see at least on that portion of the agreement a lot that s significantly different from previous types of agreements some of the practices and changes agreed to by beijing were changes that were already in the works or had been previously agreed upon petri said some of these provisions will benefit both american and chinese interests and are in keeping with beijing s longer term economic goals china wants foreign investment and may well roll out new reforms in opening insurance and other financial sectors he said china is trying to create more of an environment in which investment innovation are self reinforcing processes said dean a pinkert senior counsel at the law firm of hughes hubbard reed and a former commissioner of the u s international trade commission pinkert suggested beijing s concessions in these areas were what chinese policymakers wanted anyway i think in the long run it s as much in china s interests to address those structural reform issues as much as it s in the u s s interests he said many criticized the dispute resolution provisions for not including a mechanism for third party arbitration and worried that enforcement ultimately would hinge on the threat to reinstate or ratchet up tariffs while china certainly seeks to mitigate the impact its own economy has sustained as a result of two years worth of trade sanctions the administration s choice to lean into tariffs risks inflicting more damage on the american economy as well the people who are paying the tariffs are u s firms and u s consumers broadman said it s not clear to me what the actual economic impact will be as a dispute resolution measure to threaten china with more tariffs

a recent nber working paper by a distinguished team of economists argues that a properly designed carbon tax can be a generational win win the team led by laurence kotlikoff of boston university also includes felix kubler of the university of zurich andrey polbin of the russian presidential academy of national economy and public administration jeffrey d sachs of columbia university and simon scheidegger of the university of lausanne by a generational win win kotlikoff et al mean a policy that would benefit not only future generations who would reap the benefits of reduced warming but also those of us who would begin paying the costs of mitigation now but would live to see only small initial climate improvements the perception of a long lag between investments in climate mitigation and their full benefits has been a serious impediment to effective climate action that is true both for democratic governments and for more authoritarian regimes to the extent they are sensitive to public opinion although the paper discusses only carbon taxes similar issues are raised by cap and trade public investment direct regulation and other mitigation strategies the first section of this commentary outlines the kotlikoff plan the second section compares it to alternative strategies for dealing with the objection that climate action would pay off only in the distant future the next section discusses whether the plan can properly be understood as an intergenerational redistribution in which the future subsidizes the present as the authors contend the concluding section examines the political realism of the plan the kotlikoff plan the difficulty of getting to an intergenerational win win on climate policy arises from the fact that both climate change itself and mitigation measures operate over a long time horizon to simplify only a little the adverse effects of global warming are an increasing function of the total amount of greenhouse gases ghgs emitted into the atmosphere see this piece from my colleague joseph majkut for a deeper explanation while carbon taxes affect only the rate of emissions since ghgs especially carbon dioxide persist for long periods even a big change in the rate of emissions affects climate damages only partially and over a long time period consequently the ratio of the benefits of a carbon tax to its costs is less obvious in the short run than the long that is especially true for the basic scenario examined by kotlikoff et al which is built on the work of nobel prize winner william nordhaus under that scenario if no carbon tax is imposed business as usual global temperatures would rise by about 4 c by the end of the century global gdp in 2100 would be about 4 7 times higher than it is now but that would make it about 6 percent smaller than it would be with no climate damages the acceptable degree of warming is higher and the resulting economic damages lower than those for the scenarios considered by other researchers a point we will return to shortly based on the assumptions of the baseline scenario kotlikoff et al recommend a carbon tax that begins at 30 per ton of co2 and increases at a rate of 1 5 percent per year according to their model if such a tax were imposed in 2020 only people born in 2057 or later would experience net benefits over their lifetimes as robert p murphy has pointed out the decision to impose the tax in 2020 would have to be made by voters and their representatives born in the 20th century but the benefits would accrue not to themselves or their children or even in most cases to their grandchildren but only to their great grandchildren and even later generations to make the carbon tax into a win win kotlikoff et al recommend rewarding early generations with a lump sum cut in net taxes that would allow them to increase their consumption during the years after the carbon tax is first imposed by a lump sum tax cut they mean one that is distributed equally to all citizens without regard to their level or source of income in that regard their tax cut would resemble the citizens dividends proposed for example by the citizens climate lobby and the climate leadership council however unlike those proposals which are tax neutral in the sense that total dividends equal total revenues from the carbon tax the net lump sum tax cut envisioned by the kotlikoff model would require a super dividend in the form of a distribution or tax cut that would give more back to households than the revenues of the carbon tax itself the super dividend would be financed by issuing debt that would be retired by a tax increase scheduled for later years after the reduction in climate damages was sufficient to produce net benefits for example kotlikoff et al calculate that in their baseline case the net tax cut would give people born in 2020 a boost of 1 17 percent in their lifetime consumption while those born in 2075 would be asked to pay extra taxes equal to 1 36 percent of their lifetime consumption even so the scheme would produce a generational win win since the burden of higher future taxes would be more than offset by the benefits of reduced climate damages importantly the model assumes that utility is a function only of lifetime consumption no allowance is made for utility received from direct enjoyment of environmental amenities in what follows i will refer to these three elements a carbon tax a debt financed net tax cut for early generations and corresponding tax increases for future generations as the kotlikoff plan a comparison with other ways of getting to a generational win win kotlikoff and his co authors are not the first to grapple with the problem of persuading the current generation to adopt climate policies that have benefits that spread far into the future this section compares the kotlikoff plan to several alternatives a focus on stewardship one approach is based on persuading people now living to focus on moral responsibilities toward future generations the christian climate stewardship movement is one example as a climate scientist and a christian katharine hayhoe puts it this way we humans have been given responsibility for every living thing on this planet which includes each other we are called to tend the garden and be good stewards of the gifts that god has given us those sentiments are shared no less strongly by secular climate activists like greta thunberg who in a speech to the united nations climate action summit warned that the eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us i say we will never forgive you economists on the other hand are not traditionally comfortable with the language of moral responsibility they are more inclined to search for ways in which self interest which they see as the most reliable predictor of human behavior can be harnessed for the greater good most economists today to be sure are willing to expand the concept of self interest beyond mere selfishness and to recognize that most people do care about the welfare of others around them still they are inclined to reduce even altruism to a framework of individual utility as an entry in the handbook of economics and ethics puts it follow their self interest even when satisfying other directed preferences in other words altruism exists only when it increases the utility of the altruist to a larger extent than self directed actions would have done with given prices and constraints working within that tradition kotlikoff et al use an economic model based on overlapping selfish generations selfish as they use the term does not connote any moral judgement but simply means that in their model individual welfare or to be technical the model s utility function depends only on each person s own lifetime consumption they contrast this approach with other models that assume a benevolent and all powerful social planner or a society of altruistic or infinitely lived individuals we will return to the issue of selfishness vs altruism in the final section of this commentary unused resources a second proposed path to a generational win win is to mobilize unused resources for climate mitigation an example can be found in a levy economics institute paper how to pay for the green new deal by yeva nersisyan and l randall wray writing from the perspective of modern monetary theory the authors argue that in the neoliberal era we chronically operate below full employment so even with the official u s unemployment rate at a 50 year low they see substantial excess capacity they acknowledge that all out decarbonization efforts might encounter bottlenecks that would require taxation or rationing to redirect key inputs from other uses but they think unused resources would be able to do most of the job the kotlikoff plan in contrast does not depend on unused resources instead it is based on a model in which all available capital labor and natural resources are smoothly converted into useable output the model is further simplified by viewing the economy in global terms so that there are no imports or exports and by consolidating personal consumption and government consumption that leaves just two categories of final output consumer goods and investment the model allows total output to vary in response to changes in technology induced for example by policies that favor clean energy over fossil fuel for given resources and technology however consumption can increase only if investment decreases and vice versa in the kotlikoff model then the increase in lifetime consumption that early generations get as a result of the tax cut does not come from a keynesian boost to real gdp instead it reflects a shift in the composition of gdp from investment to consumption a double dividend while on the subject of growth it is also worth comparing the kotlikoff strategy with policy prescriptions that aim for a double dividend by directing revenues from a carbon tax toward cuts in taxes that are believed to discourage saving and investment for example taxes on corporate profits capital gains or personal incomes if such a strategy worked and not everyone believes that it would the payoff would include both lower carbon emissions and faster growth driven by greater investment conceptually if the double dividend effect were strong enough growth could accelerate so much that early generations would experience increases in both income and consumption over their lifetimes thus producing a generational win win the kotlikoff model differs from the double dividend model in two fundamental ways first selective cuts to taxes on incomes or profits would violate the lump sum principle that is baked into the kotlikoff model and second viewed in static terms the immediate effect of the double dividend model would shift the composition of gdp toward greater investment whereas the kotlikoff model shifts the composition of gdp toward greater consumption reexamine the costs and benefits still another way to get to win win is to reexamine the scenarios that determine just how large a share of the benefits of their own climate actions the current generation might capture for example it has become popular in some circles to issue warnings that we have just twelve years to do something before climate catastrophe strikes with a cascading rate of damages for global temperature increases beyond 1 5 c not just the costs but also a good part of the benefits of an all out effort to get to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 would be captured by people now living if we were to include co benefits of reducing ghg emissions such as reductions in local air pollution which are disregarded in the kotlikoff model near term gains would further increase no intergenerational altruism or compensatory taxes and dividends would be needed as discussed above the baseline scenario for the kotlikoff plan posits a very protracted evolution of costs and benefits however the team does consider alternative scenarios that would increase near term benefits for example in one scenario that is more pessimistic than the baseline they estimate that the optimal carbon tax would increase to 70 and net benefits of a tax imposed in 2020 would be felt by people born as early as 2024 resources from the future one final idea that perennially pops up calls for using resources borrowed from the future to finance decarbonization today but unfortunately although we can preserve and enhance resources for the future as the aptly named research organization urges us to do we can t draw on physical resources from the future for current use ludwig von mises made this point forcefully in a 1918 lecture on financing austria s participation in world war i some people claim that financing the war by state loans is tantamount to passing on the costs of war from the present generation to future generations it is sometimes said that this transfer is fair because war is waged not only in the interest of the present generation but also for that of our children and grandchildren nothing could be further from the truth war can be waged only out of currently available goods one can fight only with the weapons on hand all military needs must be met out of existing wealth it is the present generation that is waging war from an economic point of view and it is this generation that must bear all the material costs of the war future generations are affected only insofar as they are our heirs we will be leaving less behind for them than if war had not happened this is an unavoidable fact whether the state finances the war by indebtedness or by any other means just as the austrian soldiers of 1918 could not fight their war with artillery shells made in 1928 we cannot fight our war on climate change with wind turbines manufactured in 2057 we can as von mises pointed out affect the welfare of our heirs by our decisions to use our present resources destructively say by fighting wars or benignly by investing and conserving but they can do nothing for us the kotlikoff plan does not rely on any movement of real resources from the future to the present however some of the language used in the paper is i think misleading in that regard the next section discusses how the relationship between the present and future in the kotlikoff plan should properly be understood present and future in the kotlikoff plan as we have seen the kotlikoff plan uses debt financed tax cuts for early generations balanced by debt retiring tax increases for later generations to ensure equal utility gains for all generations implementation of the plan is assigned to a hypothetical administrative body called the lump sum redistribution authority lsra the work of the lsra is described in these terms our lsra mechanism can be viewed as a nondistortionary deﬁcit policy in which the government cuts taxes in a lump sum manner for early current and newborn generations based on the ﬁgures in the table and then raises the net tax again as indicated to service the associated debt p 27 kotlikoff invites us to think about the plan as a pareto enhancing exchange carbon taxation coupled with appropriate intergenerational redistribution can make all current and future generations better oﬀ indeed it can make them uniformly better oﬀ p 3 calculating pareto improvements is standard procedure for determining optimal policy responses to negative externalities ours appears to be the ﬁrst large scale study of pareto improving carbon taxation p 4 achieving these win win outcomes does however require signiﬁcant redistribution from future winners and transfers to early losers p 41 sharing efficiency gains evenly requires however taxing future generations by as much as 8 1 percent and subsidizing early generations by as much as 1 2 percent of lifetime consumption abstract that language makes it sound like the lsra is facilitating something like the exchange ronald coase had in mind when he discussed bargaining between a railroad and farmers whose crops are damaged by sparks from passing trains coase identified one possible outcome of those negotiations as an agreement by farmers to pay the railroad to install spark suppressors on its engines just substitute our descendants for the farmers ourselves for the railroad and a carbon tax for the spark suppressors with a little thought though we can see that the resemblances between the kotlikoff plan and the farmer railroad bargain are only superficial for one thing the kotlikoff plan involves no actual agreement we can t communicate with our descendants to learn their preferences or secure their assent we think they will be grateful to us if we start diverting capital and labor now to mitigate global warming but anything we do must be based on our judgment not theirs more importantly even if we could communicate with our descendants and bind them to an agreement there is nothing literally nothing that the future can do for us unlike the farmers in the coasean example the future can neither give us who stand in the place of the railroad the labor and capital we need to build our spark suppressors nor can they compensate us in any other way if we use our own resources to build them because of these crucial differences it is important to be careful when using words like redistribution or subsidy in a contemporaneous transaction like the farmer railroad example redistribution refers to a process in which one group the farmers transfers physical or financial resources to another group the railroad in return for a reduction in externalities such a transaction could plausibly be described as a subsidy of the railroad by the farmers in the sense that the resources relinquished by the farmers are the very resources acquired by the railroad in the kotlikoff plan the words redistribution and subsidy have completely different meanings yes carbon mitigation undertaken by early generations does produce real environmental benefits for later generations and yes the plan does envision an increase in the consumption of early generations and a reduction in that of later generations however the taxes paid by the later generations to retire previously issued debt can in no way be construed as the source of any benefits received by the earlier ones also lower consumption by later generations is not a result of the taxes they pay to retire the bonds issued in the early years of the plan those payments are merely financial transfers within their own generation instead future generations have less to consume because we left them a stock of capital that was more heavily invested in production of clean energy and less heavily invested in production of consumer goods in fact nothing that happens in the future can be said to cause anything that happens in the present among other things no harm would come to anyone in the present were future generations to decide not to carry out their end of the bargain say by continuing to roll over the bonds we issue now instead of retiring them or even simply by defaulting taking all this into account it seems fanciful to refer to taxes that may or may not be paid in the future as the source of a subsidy to present day consumers similarly the increase in current consumption envisaged by the kotlikoff plan would not be the result of any redistribution in the sense that say a tax on new yorkers to finance pell grants for students in alabama redistributes wealth between those states instead any increase in the use of resources for current consumption can only occur if there is a reduction in the use of resources for some other current purpose as if say the state of alabama cut housing assistance in order to finance the increase in pell grants but if the kotlikoff plan is not a redistribution or subsidy between generations what is it a better way to understand the kotlikoff plan in my view is to drop the authors premise that generations are selfish in favor of the more realistic assumption that each generation is composed of a mixture of selfish and altruistic individuals i put altruistic in quotation marks here to indicate use of the term in the sense discussed previously namely to denote the preferences of people who care not only what happens to themselves but also what happens to other people the other people in this case are the yet unborn inhabitants of the future we could instead speak of people who are present oriented and future oriented to get technical we could speak in terms of people with higher and lower discount rates but i think it will be clear enough to use selfish and altruistic without the quotation marks as shorthand for the whole constellation of attitudes if our own generation did not have a mixture of selfish and altruistic members the whole issue addressed by kotlikoff et al would disappear if we were all selfish and if a carbon tax would not produce net benefits in our own lifetimes we would just leave future generations to deal with their own problems on the other hand if we were all altruistic we would have enacted effective mitigation policies long since the fact that some of us are more altruistic toward future generations than others is the whole driving force behind the debate over climate policy the altruists want an effective climate policy but they can t get a majority on board properly understood then what the kotlikoff plan proposes is a pareto improving bargain within the present generation with altruistic members offering a payoff to selfish members in return for their support for climate action the payoff is not delivered through a wormhole from the future but rather through a tax cut that diverts present day resources from saving to consumption the desired climate effects are then achieved by focusing a greater share of the smaller amount of saving on investments in decarbonization the required diversion from investment to consumption is exactly what we would expect from the imposition of a carbon tax with a rebate of the proceeds equally to everyone the burden of the carbon tax would fall disproportionately on people with relatively high incomes since they are responsible for a disproportionate share of emissions although the poor are responsible for more emissions per dollar of income the rich with their higher incomes are responsible for more total emissions since the rich save more than the poor the intragenerational redistribution of income would reduce total saving considering the super dividend feature of the kotlikoff plan the effect on saving would be even more pronounced some readers might object that the net tax cut starting from a state of full employment would cause inflation other things being equal it might but not if the decrease in saving were offset by an equal decrease in total investment making sure that would happen might require measures such as a revenue neutral increase in marginal tax rates on investment or cuts in government net investment exempting investment directed to climate mitigation it might also be objected that a decrease in investment would hurt future generations who are just the people we want to help other things being equal it might but not if it takes the form of an increase in climate mitigation while making an even larger reduction in emission intensive projects to a considerable extent the carbon tax itself would accomplish the necessary realignment of investment since low carbon projects would become more profitable and high carbon projects less so policymakers who are not market purists might want to add regulatory measures or direct government investment in green projects to reinforce the tax induced shift toward clean energy clearly smaller total investment combined with a shift toward mitigation efforts will make the future better off only if the rate of return on green investment is higher than the return on investment of other kinds but if it is not then there is no economic case for climate mitigation policy in the first place and our whole discussion is moot if it is then a smaller total amount of investment better directed toward high return low emission capital will make future generations better off conclusions this commentary has discussed whether a carbon tax can be made a generational win win the issue is important since a tax whose costs are felt more quickly than its benefits is a hard sell the kotlikoff plan aims to achieve a win win using a carbon tax a debt financed net tax cut for early generations and higher taxes on future generations to retire the debt i have argued that such a plan is best understood as a pareto improving bargain in which altruistic members of the current generation offer higher immediate consumption to selfish members in return for their support for a carbon tax although future generations do not participate in the original bargain they gain to the extent they inherit a capital stock that is smaller but more heavily skewed toward clean energy in line with their presumed interest in mitigating climate damages i find the economics of the kotlikoff plan to be plausible even in their baseline case which posits moderate climate damages and a rather high maximum tolerable global temperature however i am less certain about its politics it might turn out to be neither necessary nor sufficient to break the political deadlock over climate action the kotlikoff plan might be unnecessary if as discussed earlier a majority of the politically active population became convinced that climate benefits and co benefits within the lifetime of those now living would justify a carbon tax that could happen if better estimates of the pace of climate change indicated a more rapid pace of warming than is now expected or simply if the public became more concerned over what we already know growing public demand for action might also be driven at least in part by concerns over the impending loss of intangible environmental amenities a consideration omitted from the kotlikoff model on the other hand the kotlikoff plan might turn out to be politically insufficient even if economic and scientific considerations favored it the plan calls for an altruistic faction to persuade a selfish faction to consent to a carbon tax in exchange for an increase in consumption that could happen only if the balance between the factions is such that neither can act by itself if instead the selfish faction is politically dominant why would it go along with the kotlikoff scheme why not just grab the dessert of a massive tax cut without the spinach of a big increase in energy prices in fact that is just what seems to be happening recently with economic growth driven by a rising share of consumption in gdp while decarbonization efforts languish the kotlikoff plan might also turn out to be insufficiently attractive to climate activists backers of the green new deal and similar programs often speak in terms of putting the economy on a war footing to fight an impending climate emergency they call for at least a slowdown in the growth of consumption spending if not an actual decrease and a corresponding increase in total investment such activists are likely to view the kotlikoff plan as weak tea the washington state carbon tax referendums which were opposed by many climate activists as too timid could be a case in point all

in the october world economic outlook we described the global economy as in a synchronised slowdown with escalating downside risks that could further derail growth since then some risks have partially receded with the announcement of a us china phase i trade deal and lower likelihood of a no deal brexit monetary policy has continued to support growth and buoyant financial conditions with these developments there are now tentative signs that global growth may be stabilising though at subdued levels in this update to the world economic outlook we project global growth to increase modestly from 2 9 percent in 2019 to 3 3 percent in 2020 and 3 4 percent in 2021 the slight downward revision of 0 1 percent for 2019 and 2020 and 0 2 percent for 2021 is owed largely to downward revisions for india the projected recovery for global growth remains uncertain it continues to rely on recoveries in stressed and underperforming emerging market economies as growth in advanced economies stabilises at close to current levels there are preliminary signs that the decline in manufacturing and trade may be bottoming out this is partly from an improvement in the auto sector as disruptions from new emission standards start to fade a us china phase i deal if durable is expected to reduce the cumulative negative impact of trade tensions on global gdp by end 2020 from 0 8 percent to 0 5 percent the service sector remains in expansionary territory with resilient consumer spending supported by sustained wage growth the almost synchronised monetary easing across major economies has supported demand and contributed an estimated 0 5 percentage point to global growth in both 2019 and 2020 in advanced economies growth is projected to slow slightly from 1 7 percent in 2019 to 1 6 percent in 2020 and 2021 export dependent economies like germany should benefit from improvements in external demand while us growth is forecast to slow as fiscal stimulus fades for emerging market and developing economies we forecast a pickup in growth from 3 7 percent in 2019 to 4 4 percent in 2020 and 4 6 percent in 2021 a downward revision of 0 2 percent for all years the biggest contributor to the revision is india where growth slowed sharply owing to stress in the nonbank financial sector and weak rural income growth china s growth has been revised upward by 0 2 percent to 6 percent for 2020 reflecting the trade deal with the united states the pickup in global growth for 2020 remains highly uncertain as it relies on improved growth outcomes for stressed economies like argentina iran and turkey and for underperforming emerging and developing economies such as brazil india and mexico risks retreating but still prominent overall the risks to the global economy remain on the downside despite positive news on trade and diminishing concerns of a no deal brexit new trade tensions could emerge between the united states and the european union and us china trade tensions could return such events alongside rising geopolitical risks and intensifying social unrest could reverse easy financing conditions expose financial vulnerabilities and severely disrupt growth importantly even if downside risks appear to be somewhat less salient than in 2019 policy space to respond to them is also more limited it is therefore essential that policymakers do no harm and further reduce policy uncertainty both domestic and international this will help to revive investment which remains weak policy priorities monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is still muted with interest rates expected to stay low for long macroprudential tools should be proactively used to prevent the build up of financial risks given historically low interest rates alongside weak productivity growth countries with fiscal space should invest in human capital and climate friendly infrastructure to raise potential output economies with unsustainable debt levels will need to consolidate including through effective revenue mobilisation to ensure a timely fiscal response if growth were to slow sharply countries should prepare contingent measures in advance and enhance automatic stabilisers a coordinated fiscal response may be needed to improve the effectiveness of individual measures across all economies a key imperative is to undertake structural reforms enhance inclusiveness and ensure that safety nets protect the vulnerable countries need to cooperate on multiple fronts to lift growth and spread prosperity they need to reverse protectionist trade barriers and resolve the impasse over the world trade organisation s appellate court they must adopt strategies to limit the rise in global temperatures and the severe consequences of weather related natural disasters a new international taxation regime is needed to adapt to the growing digital economy and to curtail tax avoidance and evasion while ensuring that all countries receive their fair share of tax revenues to conclude while there are signs of stabilisation the global outlook remains sluggish and there are no clear signs of a turning point there is simply no room for complacency and the world needs stronger multilateral cooperation and national level policies to support a sustained recovery that benefits all gita gopinath is economic counsellor and director of the research department at the international monetary fund

as investors enter 2020 and as they eye key economic indicators including employment they ought to consider getting defensive eric basmajian in this 2020 outlook installment suggests investors should take a balanced approach as they enter the new year they also need to keep an eye on fed actions a big surprise for 2020 basmajian suggests continued woes at boeing could impact what happens with the economy what do you expect to be the key driver of bond market performance over the course of 2020 will interest rates rise this year the us treasury market will continue to be driven by a combination of growth expectations inflation expectations monetary policy expectations and credit risk the us treasury market is more than likely to have zero credit risk in 2020 and monetary policy will ultimately follow the economy the analysis of the treasury market can therefore be simplified to growth and inflation late in 2018 when the 30 year yield was near 3 50 i wrote about a significant buying opportunity in long term bonds nasdaq tlt as yields would fall to a new all time low the analysis was based on the premise that lower growth and lower inflation would bring lower long term interest rates throughout 2019 core pce inflation fell from 1 97 to 1 6 real gdp growth declined from 3 13 in q3 of 2018 to 2 1 in q3 of 2019 the 30 year yield reached an all time low in 2019 falling below 1 90 the analysis of long term treasury bonds has changed in 2020 in 2019 both economic growth and inflation were expected to decline as we start 2020 us economic growth remains in a downward trend but leading indicators of inflation have started turning higher in january of 2019 our proprietary measure of global money supply growth turned higher gdp weighted global money supply growth source bloomberg epb macro research one year later this long leading indicator translated to a significant increase in the growth rate of raw industrial materials and core import price growth as the chart shows the growth rate of both raw industrial materials and core import prices was declining throughout 2019 growth rate of raw industrials and core import prices source bloomberg epb macro research as both long leading and short leading indicators of cyclical inflation turn higher long term bonds lose a tailwind it should be noted that this cyclical move higher in inflation will not get very far before hitting the ceiling of secular economic conditions still a cyclical increase in industrial inflation must be respected while weaker economic growth is still on the table for 2020 us inflation expectations may start to have some lift weaker economic growth will keep short term interest rates from rising in response to this change in conditions since september 2019 our model portfolio has been shifting exposure away from long duration bonds in favor of the middle short end of the curve less sensitive to inflation expectations long term interest rates may still fall if the decline in economic growth causes the federal reserve to lower interest rates further in 2020 still the risk reward profile for long term bonds has become slightly less attractive relative to the shorter end of the curve with less inflation sensitivity i will hold an overweight position in long term bonds again when both growth and inflation are expected to trend lower in unison secular economic conditions continue to support lower treasury yields across the entire curve as we begin 2020 are you bullish or bearish on u s stocks i typically do not have a bullish or bearish stance on us stocks the model portfolio at epb macro research epbmr always maintains an allocation to stocks as well as other diversified assets the way we think about stocks is to start from a portfolio that s balanced based on risk many investors are familiar with a risk parity portfolio a risk parity portfolio seeks to weigh a basket of uncorrelated assets based on their level of risk or volatility from this starting point we asses secular economic trends the level of recession risk and the direction of growth based on our proprietary indicators and business cycle research after an added layer of valuation metrics a clear picture for the months ahead can be painted while long term valuation measures have virtually no correlation to short term performance long term valuation measures such as the cape ratio are among the only metrics to have demonstrated a significant correlation to long term returns over many decades cape ratio valuation backtest model source portfolio visualizer the us economy like most of the developed world is plagued by deteriorating economic conditions manifesting in weaker rates of growth over time recession risk is not imminent because the labor market is not yet in the danger zone but the direction of growth will continue to trend lower in q1 as long as growth is moving lower closer to 0 a recession cannot be completely ruled out under these conditions moving into 2020 i currently have a slightly underweight position in us stocks relative to an allocation balanced based on risk other assets have a more attractive risk reward profile under current conditions the underweight allocation to stocks in 2019 was offset by an overweight allocation to extended duration treasury bonds up over 20 in 2019 as well if us stocks continue to rise it will benefit the portfolio but based on the present conditions a better risk reward profile can be found in other assets outside of us stocks more desirable for an overweight allocation of risk which domestic issue is most likely to adversely affect u s markets in the coming year as far as the economy and recession risk the most significant factor is currently employment when looking at economic cycles we first start with long leading indicators of economic activity such as money supply growth after a material change in direction from a variety of long leading indicators short leading indicators such as new orders start to inflect in a similar direction markets tend to react to data in the short leading time frame after short leading data however the momentum flows through coincident economic data including consumption income production and employment thus based on the sequence above the 2019 downturn in global industrial growth is just now flowing through coincident measures of employment while stocks markets globally are reacting to short leading indicators that are now mostly less bad the residual downside in coincident economic data is being ignored when economic growth moves closer to 0 this residual downside in coincident data can be recessionary implied path of employment growth source bloomberg epb macro research recently i wrote a note highlighting the current employment situation heading into 2020 how does the political climate affect the risks and opportunities for next year the actual economy is hardly influenced by the president or political party in charge trend economic growth is comprised of population growth and productivity growth assuming the government cannot control population growth that leaves productivity growth it s possible that deregulation or specific policies can improve reduce productivity on the margin but many other factors also influence productivity therefore it s difficult for a president to change trend economic output short term stimulus measures can improve the growth rate cycle for a period of time typically only several quarters still without constant stimulus an economy cannot grow meaningfully above trend for an extended period of time real gdp growth year over year and trend pace of growth source bloomberg epb macro research as the chart shows after a debt financed tax cut and several large spending bills economic growth increased in response to the additional stimulus growth however shortly after that reverted to trend potential now awaiting the next stimulus measure to carry growth above the 2 5 level corporate tax cuts and other policies can positively impact stock prices as many other analysts have suggested if a candidate who sought to raise the corporate income tax back to pre trump levels looked likely to win the stock market would likely discount that event negatively i believe the impact on the actual economy is mostly overstated the global economy is much too large for one person to control in terms of asset allocation how are you positioned as we begin the new year as i mentioned in an earlier question i start with a portfolio that s balanced based on risk or volatility then i seek to overweight underweight my allocation of risk to each asset class based on the current regime of growth and inflation the economy is expected to move towards the following table is from january s report comparing the allocation of risk or volatility between the epb long only portfolio and the common all weather portfolio january 2020 epb macro research long only allocation of risk source epb macro research as shown given the expected environment of falling growth but improving inflation real interest rates are likely to decline a decline in real rates makes short term bonds and gold very attractive risk reward profiles leading to the overweight allocation of risk the allocation of risk to stocks nysearca spy is balanced in the long only portfolio but slightly underweight in the tactical asset allocation published to members of epbmr this represents a considerable change from august 2019 when the epb long only portfolio had more than 50 of the portfolio risk allocated to long term bonds during an environment of declining growth and declining inflation this overweight allocation of risk was appropriate as long term bonds generally outperform most assets in such a situation long duration bond etf nysearca edv rose more than 15 in august 2019 it s important to note that this chart shows the allocation of risk or volatility not the nominal weightings also the goal of the research process and model portfolio strategy is to generate a sustainable return stream minimize drawdowns and maximize risk adjusted returns over time i update the model portfolios at the end of each month what surprise do you see in the market that isnâ t currently getting sufficient investor attention many investor surprises surround the us election or geopolitical issues boeing nyse ba may actually be the nasty 2020 growth surprise that many are not expecting we recently heard virtually every member of the administration articulate that boeing may knock up to 0 50 off of gdp in q1 much more according to the president with news of continued delays and a grounding that may extend well into 2h 2020 let s analyze why this may be a problem for an economy that s already cycling lower in terms of growth cyclical employment growth defined in the chart below consists of durable goods manufacturing construction and trade transportation services together this blend currently represents more than 42 million jobs in manufacturing construction and services since the 1970s whenever cyclical employment falls negative on a year over year basis a recession followed immediately cyclical employment growth source bloomberg epb macro research today due to the 2019 global slowdown cyclical employment growth is once again declining falling to the weakest reading of this expansion a clear yellow flag leading indicators of cyclical employment growth such as hours worked jobless claims and continuing claims are worsening suggesting that this trend of weaker cyclical employment growth may persist already close to the 0 level this is a risk in the economy enter boeing while boeing so far has been adamant that this production halt will not result in layoffs some other ancillary companies have not been able to hold on barron s january 10 2019 source barron s the manufacturing of aerospace products and parts employs about 550 000 people while it s true that cyclical employment is becoming a smaller share of total employment the cyclical employment basket in the chart above still represents over 25 of total jobs as far as durable goods manufacturing is concerned the transportation sector which includes cars boats trains and planes is becoming a more important share transportation employment as a percent of durable manufacturing total source bloomberg epb macro research in other words of the 8 million durable goods manufacturing jobs remaining the transportation sector is highly important therefore the issues at gm and other car companies as well as the current problems at boeing could dent durable goods manufacturing employment and cyclical employment more broadly not to mention service sector jobs tied to these manufacturing positions this comes at a time when the employment market is more vulnerable than most realize when cyclical employment growth drops below population growth and leading indicators of employment continue to weaken the unemployment rate tends to rise the top left panel below shows 2020 will have elevated employment risks relative to 1995 and 2016 two commonly referenced analogs to the federal reserve s most recent mid cycle adjustment unemployment rate at risk source bloomberg epb macro research in both prior episodes cyclical employment growth did not decline below population growth if cyclical employment growth remains under pressure in the first half of 2020 and jobless claims continuing claims extend their rise we may see the first year over year rise in the unemployment rate since 2010 in short if boeing cannot resolve the problems plaguing the 737max and is forced to layoff workers the timing could be such that cyclical employment growth falls below 0 a major red flag for the start of a vicious economic cycle and recessionary conditions keep an eye on the 737max what role will the fed play in the coming year the federal reserve will play an increasingly large roll in the coming months and years balance sheet expansion will become a regular tool and will exceed most current projections many analysts are running with the idea that the entire repo and bank liquidity issues have to do with too much treasury issuance and not enough demand i believe this is partially true we cannot have high treasury issuance onerous bank regulations and high risk asset valuations simultaneously the federal reserve in hopes of preserving the wealth effect thereby must intervene in an effort to stabilize an environment of high treasury issuance onerous bank regulations and high risk asset valuations cash assets total assets all commercial banks year over year source federal reserve epb macro research bank regulations are unlikely to become looser in the coming years a tight regime of bank regulations will coincide with explosive treasury issuance in 2020 and 2021 excessive treasury issuance absorbing bank balance sheets will crowd out the private sector similar to a december 2018 style sell off unless the federal reserve steps in to maintain the impossible trinity outlined above real estate loan growth commercial and industrial loan growth source federal reserve epb macro research the federal reserve will continue to expand its balance sheet lower rates closer to 0 or both in 2020 and 2021 as they seek to preserve high asset valuations in a heavily regulated banking system with excessive treasury issuance what issue is receiving too much investor attention and or is already priced in the trade war the global economic slowdown that unfolded throughout most of 2019 can be traced back to mid 2017 the human mind is inclined to look for stories or correct two unrelated events to explain the world around us for example in the middle of 2017 global money supply growth had peaked and started to decline the earliest signal that the global economy was responding to tighter monetary policy from the federal reserve and other central banks toward the end of 2017 and more definitively in early 2018 the growth rate in us capital goods new orders and durable goods new orders started to slip notably after a few more confirming short leading indicators including the growth rate of the crb raw industrials index the ism chicago pmi and supplier delivery times a deep industrial downturn was underway in early 2018 president trump slapped tariffs on some chinese goods and all the decline in economic growth thereafter was blamed on an event that was unfolding based on monetary policy choices a year earlier it was not until september 2018 that the growth rate in the industrial production index a coincident indicator peaked this order of operations should help clarify the sequence of economic cycles and the importance of having long leading short leading and coincident economic indicators this classic economic sequence has now arrived at employment one of the more lagging indicators from the coincident data bucket ironically as phase 1 of the trade deal was inked earlier this month leading indicators of global industrial growth have started to improve this will of course be wrongfully attributed to the resolution of the trade war rather than the massive flip in central bank policy in december of 2018 upon shifting from tightening to easing global money supply growth bottomed in january 2019 and increased throughout the year this long leading indicator was improving while short leading and coincident data started to tumble gdp weighted global money supply growth source bloomberg epb macro research after nearly a year of improving global money supply growth the growth in german manufacturing new orders started to improve the growth of german industrial new orders has been improving since april 2019 germany manufacturing real new orders growth rate source bloomberg epb macro research this improvement in global short leading indicators of industrial activity will flow through to coincident data points such as industrial production in the coming months while us industrial production growth will lag the global improvement pinning both the start and conclusion of the global slowdown on the trade spat with china avoids the long standing economic cycle sequence the trade dispute certainly did not help manufacturing conditions but it was not the driving force behind the decline or the recovery if you understand the economic cycle and have a process to identify the slow moving ups and downs you can prosper as an investor in all market environments

by a common claim is that genetically modified organisms gmos are essential to agriculture if we are to feed an ever growing global population supporters of genetically engineered ge crops argue that by increasing productivity and yields this technology will also help boost farmers incomes and lift many out of poverty although in this article it will be argued that the performance of ge crops to date has been questionable the main contention is that the pro gmo lobby both outside of india and within has wasted no time in wrenching the issues of hunger and poverty from their political contexts to use notions of helping farmers and feeding the world as lynchpins of its promotional strategy there exists a haughty imperialism within the pro gmo scientific lobby that aggressively pushes for a gmo solution which is a distraction from the root causes of poverty hunger and malnutrition and genuine solutions based on food justice and food sovereignty last year in the journal current science dr deepak pental developer of genetically engineered ge mustard at delhi university responded to a previous paper in the same journal by eminent scientists pc kesavan and ms swaminathan which questioned the efficacy of and the need for genetically modified organisms gmos in agriculture pental argued that the two authors had aligned themselves with environmentalists and ideologues who have mindlessly attacked the use of genetic engineering ge technology to improve crops required for meeting the food and nutritional needs of a global population that is predicted to peak at 11 2 billion pental added that aspects of the two authors analysis are a reflection of their ideological proclivities the use of the word mindlessly is telling and betrays pental s own ideological disposition his words reflect tired industry inspired rhetoric that says criticisms of ge technology are driven by ideology not fact if hunger and malnutrition are to be tackled effectively the pro gmo lobby must put aside this type of rhetoric which is designed to close down debate it should accept valid concerns about the gmo paradigm and be willing to consider why the world already produces enough to feed 10 billion people but over two billion are experiencing micronutrient deficiencies of which 821 million were classed as chronically undernourished in 2018 critics valid concerns or ideologues the performance of ge crops has been a hotly contested issue and as highlighted in kevasan and swaminathan s piece and by others there is already sufficient evidence to question their efficacy especially that of herbicide tolerant crops which by 2007 already accounted for approximately 80 of biotech derived crops grown globally and the devastating impacts on the environment human health and food security not least in places like latin america we should not accept the premise that only ge can solve problems in agriculture in their paper kesavan and swaminathan argue that ge technology is supplementary and must be need based in more than 99 of cases they say that time honoured conventional breeding is sufficient in this respect conventional options and innovations that outperform ge must not be overlooked or sidelined in a rush by powerful interests like the bill and melinda gates foundation to facilitate the introduction of ge crops into global agriculture crops which are highly financially lucrative for the corporations behind them in europe robust regulatory mechanisms are in place for gmos because it is recognised that ge food crops are not substantially equivalent to their non ge counterparts numerous studies have highlighted the flawed premise of substantial equivalence furthermore from the outset of the gmo project the sidelining of serious concerns about the technology has occurred and despite industry claims to the contrary there is no scientific consensus on the health impacts of ge crops as noted by hilbeck et al environmental sciences europe 2015 adopting a precautionary principle where ge is concerned is therefore a valid approach as hilbeck et al note both the cartagena protocol and codex share a precautionary approach to ge crops and foods in that they agree that ge differs from conventional breeding and that safety assessments should be required before gmos are used in food or released into the environment there is sufficient reason to hold back on commercialising ge crops and to subject each gmo to independent transparent environmental social economic and health impact evaluations critics concerns cannot therefore be brushed aside by claims that the science is decided and the facts about ge are indisputable such claims are merely political posturing and part of a strategy to tip the policy agenda in favour of ge in india various high level reports have advised against the adoption of ge crops appointed by the supreme court the technical expert committee tec final report 2013 was scathing about india s prevailing regulatory system and highlighted its inadequacies and serious inherent conflicts of interest the tec recommended a 10 year moratorium on the commercial release of all ge crops as we have seen with the push to get ge mustard commercialised the problems described by the tec persist through her numerous submissions to the supreme court aruna rodrigues has argued that ge mustard is being pushed through based on outright regulatory delinquency it must also be noted that this crop is herbicide tolerant which as stated by the tec is wholly inappropriate for india with its small biodiverse multi cropping farms while the above discussion has only scratched the surface it is fair to say that criticisms of ge technology and various restrictions and moratoriums have not been driven by mindless proclivities can ge crops feed the world the gene revolution is sometimes regarded as green revolution 2 0 the green revolution too was sold under the guise of feeding the world however emerging research indicates that in india it merely led to more wheat in the diet while food productivity per capita showed no increase or actually decreased globally the green revolution dovetailed with the consolidation of an emerging global food regime based on agro export mono cropping often with non food commodities taking up prime agricultural land and unfair liberalised trade linked to sovereign debt repayment and world bank imf structural adjustment privatisation directives the outcomes have included a displacement of a food producing peasantry the consolidation of western agri food oligopolies and the transformation of many countries from food self sufficiency into food deficit areas and yet the corporations behind this system of dependency and their lobbyists waste no time in spreading the message that this is the route to achieving food security their interests lie in business as usual today we hear terms like foreign direct investment and making india business friendly but behind the rhetoric lies the hard nosed approach of globalised capitalism the intention is for india s displaced cultivators to be retrained to work as cheap labour in the west s offshored plants india is to be a fully incorporated subsidiary of global capitalism with its agri food sector restructured for the needs of global supply chains and a reserve army of labour that effectively serves to beat workers and unions in the west into submission global food insecurity and malnutrition are not the result of a lack of productivity as long as these dynamics persist and food injustice remains an inbuilt feature of the global food regime the rhetoric of ge being necessary for feeding the world will be seen for what it is bombast although india fares poorly in world hunger assessments the country has achieved self sufficiency in food grains and has ensured there is enough food in terms of calories available to feed its entire population it is the world s largest producer of milk pulses and millets and the second largest producer of rice wheat sugarcane groundnuts vegetables fruit and cotton according to the united nations food and agriculture organization fao food security is achieved when all people at all times have physical social and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life food security for many indians remains a distant dream large sections of india s population do not have enough food available to remain healthy nor do they have sufficiently diverse diets that provide adequate levels of micronutrients the comprehensive national nutrition survey 2016 18 is the first ever nationally representative nutrition survey of children and adolescents in india it found that 35 per cent of children under five were stunted 22 per cent of school age children were stunted while 24 per cent of adolescents were thin for their age people are not hungry in india because its farmers do not produce enough food hunger and malnutrition result from various factors including inadequate food distribution gender inequality and poverty in fact the country continues to export food while millions remain hungry it s a case of scarcity amid abundance where farmers livelihoods are concerned the pro gmo lobby says ge will boost productivity and help secure cultivators a better income again this is misleading it ignores crucial political and economic contexts even with bumper harvests indian farmers still find themselves in financial distress india s farmers are not experiencing financial hardship due to low productivity they are reeling from the effects of neoliberal policies years of neglect and a deliberate strategy to displace smallholder agriculture at the behest of the world bank and predatory global agri food corporations little wonder then that the calorie and essential nutrient intake of the rural poor has drastically fallen however aside from putting a positive spin on the questionable performance of gmo agriculture the pro gmo lobby both outside of india and within has wasted no time in wrenching these issues from their political contexts to use the notions of helping farmers and feeding the world as lynchpins of its promotional strategy ge was never intended to feed the world many of the traditional practices of india s small farmers are now recognised as sophisticated and appropriate for high productive sustainable agriculture it is no surprise therefore that a recent fao high level report has called for agroecology and smallholder farmers to be prioritised and invested in to achieve global sustainable food security it argues that scaling up agroecology offers potential solutions to many of the world s most pressing problems whether for instance climate change and carbon storage soil degradation water shortages unemployment or food security agroecological principles represent a shift away from the reductionist yield output industrial paradigm which results in among other things enormous pressures on soil and water resources to a more integrated low input systems approach to food and agriculture that prioritises local food security local calorific production cropping patterns and diverse nutrition production per acre water table stability climate resilience good soil structure and the ability to cope with evolving pests and disease pressures such a system would be underpinned by a concept of food sovereignty based on optimal self sufficiency the right to culturally appropriate food and local ownership and stewardship of common resources such as land water soil and seeds traditional production systems rely on the knowledge and expertise of farmers in contrast to imported solutions yet if we take cotton cultivation in india as an example farmers continue to be nudged away from traditional methods of farming and are being pushed towards illegal ge herbicide tolerant cotton seeds researchers glenn stone and andrew flachs note the results of this shift from traditional practices to date does not appear to have benefited farmers this isn t about giving farmers choice where ge seeds and associated chemicals are concerned it is more about ge seed companies and weedicide manufactures seeking to leverage a highly lucrative market the potential for herbicide market growth in india is enormous and industry looked for sales to reach usd 800 million by 2019 the objective involves opening india to ge seeds with herbicide tolerance traits the biotechnology industry s biggest money maker by far 86 per cent of the world s ge crop acres in 2015 contain plants resistant to glyphosate or glufosinate and there is a new generation of crops resistant to 2 4 d coming through the aim is to break farmers traditional pathways and move them onto corporate biotech chemical treadmills for the benefit of industry calls for agroecology and highlighting the benefits of traditional small scale agriculture are not based on a romantic yearning for the past or the peasantry available evidence suggests that non gmo smallholder farming using low input methods is more productive in total output than large scale industrial farms and can be more profitable and resilient to climate change it is for good reason that the fao high level report referred to earlier as well as the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food prof hilal elver call for investment in this type of agriculture which is centred on small farms despite the pressures including the fact that globally industrial agriculture grabs 80 per cent of subsidies and 90 per cent of research funds smallholder agriculture plays a major role in feeding the world that s a massive quantity of subsidies and funds to support a system that is only made profitable as a result of these financial injections and because agri food oligopolies externalize the massive health social and environmental costs of their operations but policymakers tend to accept that profit driven transnational corporations have a legitimate claim to be owners and custodians of natural assets the commons these corporations their lobbyists and their political representatives have succeeded in cementing a thick legitimacy among policy makers for their vision of agriculture from world bank enabling the business of agriculture directives to the world trade organization agreement on agriculture and trade related intellectual property agreements international bodies have enshrined the interests of corporations that seek to monopolise seeds land water biodiversity and other natural assets that belong to us all these corporations the promoters of gmo agriculture are not offering a solution for farmers impoverishment or hunger ge seeds are little more than a value capture mechanism to evaluate the pro gmo lobby s rhetoric that ge is needed to feed the world we first need to understand the dynamics of a globalised food system that fuels hunger and malnutrition against a backdrop of subsidised food overproduction we must acknowledge the destructive predatory dynamics of capitalism and the need for agri food giants to maintain profits by seeking out new foreign markets and displacing existing systems of production with ones that serve their bottom line and we need to reject a deceptive haughty imperialism within the pro gmo scientific lobby which aggressively pushes for a gmo solution

of investor relations with rogers communications please go ahead mr carpino paul carpino vice president investor relations thank you ariel good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today i m here with our president and chief executive officer joe natale our chief financial officer tony staffieri and our chief technology and information officer jorge fernandes today s discussion will include estimates and other forward looking information from which our actual results could differ please review the cautionary language in today s earnings report and in our 2018 annual report regarding various factors assumptions and risks that could cause our actual results to differ with that let me turn it over to joe joe natale president and chief executive officer thank you paul and good morning everyone this morning we released our 2019 fourth quarter and full year results along with our 2020 guidance let me start with some comments on the overall year followed by the fourth quarter in 2019 we took significant steps to position rogers for long term growth and success on the strategic front we led the industry with the launch of unlimited data we accelerated the rollout of ignite tv we laid the critical foundation for 5g we drove solid growth in our b2b segment we repositioned media for the future we also made meaningful progress on the customer experience front we improved service levels grew digital adoption increased the critical customer metrics likelihood to recommend and reduced our overall cost to serve from a culture perspective we hit a record 85 in employee engagement exceeding global best in class by 5 points and proudly we were named one of canada s most admired corporate cultures overall we made some standard progress on our strategic priorities in terms of financials for the full year we continued to deliver cash flow and ebitda growth if you put aside the impact of our unlimited transition we continued to grow with the key underlying fundamentals of the business turning to the fourth quarter our net financials came in as expected and subscriber metrics were very strong in wireless we delivered stable financials and saw strong underlying growth we added 131 000 postpaid net subscribers and grew our infinite base to 1 4 million overall the rate of infinite adoption continues to exceed our expectations it is very clear we have a compelling value proposition that resonates with canadians as a reminder we led the industry with the launch of unlimited data and equipment financing to achieve three objectives one stimulate data use and get ready for 5g by driving affordability two drive a step change in the customer experience and reduce the cost to serve and three reduce the cost of acquisition and retention we are seeing good momentum on all three fronts i remain incredibly proud of our team for the leadership and the disciplined execution of these plans in cable we delivered solid financials in the fourth quarter driven by internet and the adoption of ignite tv internet remains a cornerstone of our cable business and we continued to deliver strong and steady growth in revenue and continued and sustained growth in penetration we ended the year with 325 000 subscribers on ignite tv and completed the rollout of the service to our entire cable footprint as an exclusive product for our cable footprint in 2019 we significantly enhanced our product roadmap we launched global best in class wifi hub technology introduced self install added amazon prime and sportsnet now with more streaming services to come looking ahead to 2020 in our cable strategy we re even more excited about our product roadmap it includes more connected home technologies video entertainment flexibility along with popular content and ott integration finally we continued to return capital to shareholders maintained the strength of our balance sheet and delivered in our capital allocation priorities we returned cad1 7 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and almost 70 increase over last year and we delivered industry leading total shareholder returns of 36 over the past three years this morning we released our 2020 outlook it reflects our continued planned transition to unlimited data with no overage fees as we highlighted last quarter our results will be muted in the first half of the year we will return to growth in the second half fundamentally it is about improving our trajectory as the year progresses looking ahead to our wireless strategy 2020 begins a rollout of 5g 35 years ago we were the first to launch wireless services in canada and we are proud to bring this new important technology to canadians on canada s only national network last week we announced the start of our 5g rollout bringing it to downtown vancouver toronto ottawa and montreal so it is ready when 5g devices become available this year we just finished testing canada s first 5g device from samsung which will become available in march we further we will further expand our 5g network to over 20 more markets this year our 5g network will initially use 2 5 gigahertz spectrum and expand to use 600 megahertz spectrum later this year last year we secured 80 of the available 600 megahertz spectrum in every single province and territory this premium 5g spectrum provides great propagation across long distances and through dense urban environments creating more consistent coverage in remote areas and smart cities we will also start deploying dynamic spectrum sharing technology which will allow 4g spectrum to be used for 5g earlier this month we became the exclusive canadian member of the new 5g future forum a 5g and mobile edge computing alliance that includes verizon vodafone telstra korea telecom and america movil the global alliance will create a common framework for 5g applications across the americas asia pacific and europe over the next several years 5g will start to transform businesses and industries with increased speed and capacity more efficient use of spectrum improved battery life and lower latency the 5g is more than just speed over time 5g will support a massive increase in the number of connected devices these devices will require near instantaneous connections for smart cities for remote patient healthcare robotics driverless vehicles virtual reality and gaming 5g will touch every industry and transform our world unlike any other wireless technology as you know rogers is partnered with ericsson north america s 5g partner of choice we have established key partnerships to research incubate and commercialize made in canada 5g technology this includes r d partnerships with the university of british columbia the university of waterloo and communitech it includes collaboration with government and industry through ryerson university and encqor 5g these relationships are not only advancing 5g they are attracting young talent who want to shape canada s 5g roadmap with us investment is the lifeblood of wireless networks investing in 5g is not only critical to canada s digital economy it is critical to canada s global competitiveness the race to 5g is not with other companies it is with other countries over the past 35 years we have invested over cad30 billion to bring canadians the best wireless networks in the world we invested because we have the right public policy the right regulation to spur investment and spur innovation in 2020 alone we plan to spend almost cad3 billion in capital to build canada s communications infrastructure this capital and this investment is at risk we do not have the right regulation as we enter the world of 5g regulatory certainty is critical to investment we need regulation that encourages investment and fuels innovation punitive regulation will slow or worse stall 5g deployment and expansion of rural connectivity will happen at a snail s pace if at all ultimately it is about balancing affordability with investment striking the right balance is key to canada s digital future the government has shown they can effectively achieve this balance and they must do it again for canada looking ahead we are well positioned to drive long term growth deliver the most advanced networks and dramatically improve our customers experience and with that let me turn over to tony tony over to you tony staffieri chief financial officer thank you joe and good morning everyone overall we re pleased with the momentum with which we exited the fourth quarter of 2019 particularly on the subscriber front we had strong subscriber metrics in both our wireless and cable offering driven by the continued transition associated with our unlimited data infinite plans customers continue to embrace these plans and the revenue improvement arpu lift and efficiency benefits associated with these plans should contribute to healthy financial growth in the second half of 2020 i will provide more color on our guidance for 2020 momentarily but let me give you a quick recap of the quarter in wireless service revenue decreased 1 year on year driven by a reduction in blended arpu as a result of reduction in overage fees importantly however the year over year rate of decline in arpu in the fourth quarter is already starting to improve compared to q3 as overage decline slowed and more customers came in on infinite plan gross and net postpaid subscriber additions as well as subscriber adoption of our infinite plans were strong in q4 net postpaid loading was up a healthy 17 as we added 131 000 postpaid subscribers this robust growth was driven by an active market where rogers clearly benefited from the appeal of our infinite and fido plans our extensive distribution channels and our leading wireless national network churn was up 3 basis points from last year and again better trending in the 11 basis point increase we saw in q3 and better than we expected going into the quarter i do want to draw your attention to an adjustment we made to our postpaid base in the quarter effective october 1 we reduced our postpaid subscriber base by 53 000 subs to remove a low arpu public service customer that is in the process of migrating to another service provider this adjustment had very minimal impact in the quarter to churn and net additions on blended arpu our year over year decline was 1 6 including these subscribers and was a decline of 1 2 when removed equipment revenue was up 7 this quarter benefiting from higher postpaid gross additions and a shift in the product mix to higher value devices while the fourth quarter remained a competitive period it s important to note that price plans for infinite have remained stable since launch and subsidies on a per unit subscriber continue to decline year on year albeit at rates still well below our expectations when we first launched equipment instalment plans back in july for the full year our overall subsidy expenses down on a full year basis as well as in q4 in 2020 we anticipate further declines in our subsidies as our value propositions for customers continue to shift to unlimited data plan offerings and zero interest rates on our equipment financing despite the ongoing reduction in overage revenue wireless adjusted ebitda grew 4 or flat year on year when excluding the lease accounting impact we remain very encouraged by the faster uptake of our unlimited infinite plans and we continue to expect further operational and financial benefits from these plans as we complete the migration offering customers simple unlimited plans paired with zero percent device financing is healthy for our industry as we improve our cost structure lower the cost for consumers and ultimately have happier customers with a lower propensity to churn as important this transformation will better position us for sustainable long term growth in a 5g world where data usage will be materially higher ultimately usage growth will not only drive growth for our industry but continue to drive down the cost per gig for our customers turning to cable revenue was flat compared to the prior year fourth quarter and adjusted ebitda grew by 2 our internet offering performed strongly and continues to be a key driver for our cable business internet revenue grew 7 this quarter reflecting the movement of internet customers to higher speed tiers and a larger internet subscriber base in q4 we reported 27 000 net internet subscriber additions 2 000 more than the prior year fourth quarter this reflects the 18th consecutive quarter of increasing penetration rates in addition internet arpu grew year over year we re in a strong position to meet customer demand for faster speeds and higher data with our ability to offer ignite gigabit internet across our entire cable footprint cable margins expanded by another 100 basis points this quarter due to continued focus on efficiencies and product mix shift to higher margin internet ebitda margins were 50 4 and cable capex intensity was 29 down significantly from the 43 in q4 of 2018 as reflected in these results we continue to make excellent progress toward our goal of 20 to 22 cable capital intensity and 254 cash margins by the end of 2021 moving to media revenue was 2 lower year on year largely as a result of the sale of our publishing business excluding the impact of the sale of publishing media revenue would have increased by 1 this quarter media ebitda was down 45 due to the lower revenue and higher programing costs during the quarter on a consolidated basis we reported a slight decline in revenue and adjusted ebitda growth of 1 we invested cad791 million in capex for the quarter which decreased 4 year over year the decrease in capital expenditures was largely driven by our cable business as we overlap our ignite tv ramp up lower customer premise equipment purchases and a network and network investments we had pulled forward to realize the economies of scale capex intensity in wireless was 14 during the quarter we continued augmenting our existing lte network with our ericsson 5g ready technology investments we re also working on deploying our 600 megahertz spectrum along with other bands to expand our 5g coverage rogers is excited to be leading canada s 5g charge as joe has highlighted the significant investments we are making are critical to the successful deployment of 5g and essential to keeping canadians competitive on a global scale our commitment to generate strong free cash flow and return significant capital to shareholders remains strong even during this heightened investment cycle and launch of our infinite plans we generated free cash flow of cad497 million this quarter an increase of 6 the notable increase this quarter was a result of higher adjusted ebitda along with capital efficiencies in cable our cash tax rate as a percentage of adjusted ebitda was 4 in the quarter and 6 for the year and we anticipate our cash tax rate to remain in the 6 range for fiscal 2020 we returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments of cad256 million and repurchased cad357 million in class b non voting shares in the quarter for the full year we returned cad1 7 billion to our shareholders with more than cad1 billion in dividends and cad655 million in share buybacks in 2019 our capital return to shareholders was almost 70 higher than 2018 our debt leverage ratio at the end of q4 was 2 9 times reflecting a 40 basis point increase compared to the end of 2018 as we mentioned in previous quarters ifrs 16 lease accounting drove 20 basis points of the increase and the completion of our 600 megahertz spectrum purchase added 30 basis points ebitda growth during the year helped drive leverage down by 10 basis points with a healthy business and strong free cash flow we expect to continue reducing our leverage over time moving closer to 2 5 times in the future however given the current low interest rate environment we expect to do so at a steady natural pace we have liquidity of cad2 5 billion at the end of the quarter and have solid investment grade credit ratings with a stable outlook additionally our balance sheet is well positioned with long term maturities and low interest rates on our outstanding debt our weighted average interest rate at year end was 4 3 with average term to maturities of 14 1 years let me move on to our 2020 guidance in october of 2019 we updated our 2019 financial outlook to reflect the accelerated adoption of rogers infinite plans there were three key items we highlighted then the first was that the majority of overage revenue was going to be eliminated in four to six quarters versus the six to eight quarter time frame we had originally estimated in july the second key item was that the second half of 2019 and first half of 2020 would share similar growth dynamics in terms of year over year arpu and revenue declines the third was that this accelerated adoption rate also meant that we would realize the cost and revenue benefits of these plans sooner for our 2020 outlook we are reiterating the dynamics we highlighted back in october and we have built our outlook accordingly starting with revenues we expect service revenue growth for the full year to be between positive 2 and negative 2 previously we provided total revenue guidance including hardware revenue given the hardware dependency of this metric together with the non cash impact of ifrs accounting and equipment instalment plans we have transitioned this guidance metric to service revenue which is a more meaningful metric for the business for ebitda we anticipate delivering between flat to up to 2 year on year growth as already mentioned we anticipate the first half of 2020 to reflect negative year over year growth in both of these metrics but in the second half of the year we continue to anticipate these numbers to resume year over year growth the second half improvements reflect the benefit of arpu improvements greater cost efficiency associated with our unlimited plans as well as other cost productivity initiatives capital expenditures are expected to be in the cad2 7 billion to cad2 9 billion range however as joe has noted our investment program could be reduced meaningfully if any regulatory decision proves to be unsupported to making these investments finally for free cash flow we expect solid growth of 2 to 4 2020 will be an exciting year for rogers overage revenue will become less than 1 of our wireless service revenue device subsidy cost will be reduced customers will have simpler and robust data plans and data usage will grow as we drive forward with our 5g network these are all healthy signs of a strong and highly competitive canadian wireless industry we embrace the leadership role we have as canada s largest wireless company and look forward to providing our customers with the best network performance and best customer experience in our industry with that i ll ask the operator to open the lines for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session our first question comes from vince valentini of td securities vince valentini td securities analyst yeah thanks very much can i start with wireless arpu and overage if my math is correct you would have been plus 1 instead of minus 1 on arpu growth without the overage that points to about cad40 million tony correct me if i m wrong on that that would be a bit lower than the cad50 million you talked about in q3 so that means is that math correct and does that mean there can be lumpiness in seasonality from quarter to quarter because obviously you had more customers on unlimited plans in q4 than you did in q3 but yet the amount of loss seems to have come down a bit so if you can clarify that first and then secondly with this capex guidance i want to make sure i m clear the reduction in cable you re talking about by the end of 2021 doesn t look like a lot of that is baked into your guidance range for 2020 are you expecting most of that decline from call it 29 down to 20 to 22 to happen next year and not in 2020 and the last related to that as well just to clarify how you phrased it is the cad2 9 billion an aspirational high end capex number that only is possible if we have a perfect regulatory world this year in terms of no mvnos at all no implementation of those lower tpia rates if there is anything negative on the regulatory front you d be less than cad2 9 billion thanks tony staffieri chief financial officer thanks vince i ll start with first question which related to the overage decline in the fourth quarter your math is roughly correct in the third quarter we disclosed that we had overage decline of about cad50 million in the fourth quarter we had slightly less than that a little more than the cad40 million that you re quoting but we saw a slight year on year decline notwithstanding the fact that we had more customers come on to the infinite plans keep in mind that q3 is a seasonally high quarter with respect to overage revenues and so what you had in the fourth quarter is the combination of the seasonal decline offset by the increased number of customers on the infinite plans with respect to your second question on capex the range we provided of cad2 7 billion to cad2 9 billion reflects our intent to continue to reduce cable capital intensity this year in 2019 you saw us come down to 29 for the full year and we re pleased with the progress that we made on that and so you ll continue you should continue to expect cable capital intensity to decline further in 2020 and so it will be good meaningful progress and then we expect it to decline again so that our exit rate by end of 2021 is in the 20 to 22 capital intensity range in terms of regulatory impact the range we provided of cad2 7 billion and cad2 9 billion is based on the fundamentals we ve always talked about wireless capital intensity in the 14 range cable we talked about coming down and then a few other items related to corporate initiatives the range we provided was intended to give us a bit of flexibility for a number of factors including the timing of some of the 5g investments but also the migration and pace of and quantum of migration of customers to ignite tv and so we wanted to give ourselves a bit of flexibility for that the complete range we provided of cad2 7 billion to cad2 9 billion is based on our current regulatory outlook and so to the extent that regulatory decisions in the year were adverse or negative to what currently exists we could very well see an investment range of less than cad2 7 billion or the bottom end of our capex range vince valentini td securities analyst excellent thank you operator our next question comes from simon flannery of morgan stanley landon park morgan stanley analyst good morning this is landon park on for simon i was wondering if you could just walk through some of the levers at your disposable given the fact that your revenue guidance has a wider range than your ebitda guidance and what you might be able to do if revenues do trend to one extreme or the other and then secondly i was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the performance uplift we should expect on your low band 5g versus what we would have seen on a low band 4g network and do you have any specific expectations on the timing of dss in devices and availability of that technology joe natale president and chief executive officer okay why don t i take the first one landon and then i m going to ask jorge to comment on the low band 5g performance comparing it to 4g on the first one if you look at our guidance we took it from a perspective of putting forward a conservative set of financial guidance points we give ourselves a wide berth on the revenue front just to make sure that we had the understanding and the opportunity to kind of manage through whatever competitive dynamic might happen in the marketplace as we work through some pretty substandard changes that are happening the move to unlimited the move to equipment financing these will have a broader impact on the market rest assured that we are squarely focused on growing ebitda and expanding margins in the business we ve had a history of driving good margin expansion if you recall between 2017 and 2018 over the two year period we expanded margins by 200 basis points and we ve got a series of opportunities in our cost playbook and cost disciplined ideas that will continue to drive that trajectory and therefore provide great support with respect to the ebitda guidance we ve put forward and the ability to kind of manage any sort of ups and downs in the marketplace also bear in mind that part of the reason we go to unlimited is to drive the simplicity dividend and if you look at unlimited we re already seeing in the underlying number is a strong cost efficiency payback as a whole i ll give you a few sort of specific thoughts on that we talked about the underlying arpu being strong when you adjust for the overage decline but if you at likelihood to recommend it s very strong for infinite base and churn is materially lower so that drives very good lifetime value economics the propensity to call is far lower as a whole and therefore we re seeing less activity in our call centers with our infinite base and these are all the things that translate through to better cost efficiency as we launch equipment financing and make it the primary way of getting a device on the rogers brand and the fido brand it will continue to drive better efficiencies on that front our assumption in our guidance is that equipment subsidies will largely be as they were last year so anything that comes along in terms of improved equipment subsidies is goodness to the overall plan that we have in place for our business so we see these as big opportunities and we have our eyes fairly squarely focused on driving the cost margin so that will in turn allow us to create better affordability for our customers so there could be greater adoption and penetration of our services and also to free up cash to invest in the future of this business and that s the virtuous cycle that we re after jorge jorge fernandes chief technology officer thank you jeff on the performance of the 5g low band as we ve explained before our spectrum strategy is based on the combination of the low band spectrum primarily for coverage the mid bands for coverage and capacity and then over time high band millimeter wave for deployment in areas where we have high density of users the issue for low band spectrum is not so much about an immediate greater performance than 4g it s more about providing an equivalent coverage footprint than 4g at relatively low cost given that the site footprint is already there the real benefits over time comes when the 5g stand alone core becomes available at that point we ll be able to combine both the new capabilities of 5g namely around iot capacity and low latency with a very wide available coverage so that s the key on the dynamic spectrum sharing we re currently testing the technology it will be available later this year obviously that will give us greater flexibility as of course the 5g and set growth happens we will have the flexibility to manage spectrum across 4g and 5g and use our current and future spectrum assets in a more efficient way paul carpino vice president investor relations thanks landon landon park morgan stanley analyst do you expect dsf to be in line with devices this year jorge fernandes chief technology officer yes we do landon park morgan stanley analyst okay great thank you very much paul carpino vice president investor relations thanks landon next question ariel operator our next question comes from tim casey of bmo tim casey bmo capital markets analyst thanks i m sorry if you went over this already joe but could you talk a little bit about the uptick in q4 of subscribers to infinite and how you think that will progress through next year and just a clarification the sub count adjustment you made can you flush that out for us tony because i know you had removed some of the federal contract i believe it was last year that was going over to your competitor how should we think about the adjustment this year in respect of the 131 000 postpaid adds you posted thanks joe natale president and chief executive officer tim we re very pleased with the adoption of infinite in q4 and it exceeded our expectations i think we re thinking maybe closer to 1 3 million and a bit coming out at 1 4 million again was ahead of expectations and the way to look at it is we see that continuing to ramp if you will through the first half of the year and then get to more of a steady state place in the second half of the year is the way i would kind of look at it as a whole the mix we re seeing is still in the same range i talked about last time 60 of people adopting infinite are upgraders and 40 are downgraders spending less or rate optimizing if you will but the vast majority of the transition to infinite will be done by july 1 is our current projection and after that it will be kind of steady state price plan changes new customers coming along pre to post migrations people migrating from fido to rogers all those sorts of things that are kind of a normal course of business i ll say again as i said to landon just a minute ago we re really happy with the underlying economics of what we re seeing it s playing out exactly as we hoped the underlying recurring arpu is strong when you take into account the mix i talked about the churn benefits are material and the impact in terms of cost to serve cost to support is far better all kind of held up by likelihood to recommend which should at the end of the day kind of is a very key metric in terms of customers desire to stay with us over the long run the next big sort of focus is working the equipment subsidy side of the equation as we ve said before there is a big opportunity there we have some of the biggest subsidies of any country in the world and often our price gets confused between what is inherently the subsidy burn off or the leasing of the device compared to the underlying rate of service plan so our goal is to make things more clear and simple for our customers and distinguish those two items along the way we think we have an opportunity to drive better overall economics and again use that money for driving affordability and investing in 5g in the future as a whole so that s kind of the tale of the tape over the last little while the volume of calls that we re taking right now to go to infinite or discuss infinite are outweighing the lessening of the support calls for the base and that sort of those lines will really begin to cross in the middle of the year but you can imagine that the volume of activity has been substantial if you look at the volume of activity around price plan changes or customers asking about this we re seeing three to four times the regular volume of normal inquiries around rates and plans and things of that nature so that s kind of the tax we re paying in the short term as the lines cross we ll see the goodness come to the surface and we re seeing that underlying the metrics right now as we kind of evolve this transition tony staffieri chief financial officer on the second part of your question tim as i said we made the adjustment for 53 000 customers it was a provincial government contract they were looking for pricing at extremely low arpus that economically didn t make sense for us and so that business is transferring to another service provider in terms of the transition during the fourth quarter the number was very small literally a few thousand and so it had a negligible impact on our net postpaid subscriber reported number as well as on our churn number and in terms of the impact to the base as i said the year on year growth rate was impacted by 40 basis points as a result of that adjustment and so we wanted to follow the same type of approach we did for the government of canada as you highlighted and wanted to avoid the distortion that it would provide in our metrics going forward particularly given the low arpu that we were talking about for this as i said the economics just didn t work for us the lifetime value was negative and dilutive to our business and so we think we made the right decision on that tim casey bmo capital markets analyst thank you paul carpino vice president investor relations next question ariel operator our next question comes from maher yaghi of desjardins maher yaghi desjardins analyst thanks for taking my question i m trying to get my head around the guidance i m sorry to get back on that topic again but when i look at your exiting results for q4 on ebitda with a plus 1 you re accounting for ebitda for 2020 to between 0 and 2 so middle ground is 1 why should we see continued degradation in ebitda growth in the first half when a lot of the pain or some pain already has materialized in q3 and q4 and affected your ebitda growth so i m trying to just figure out what s the cause of the increased pressure on ebitda growth in the first half and i guess inside that guidance what s your assumption on subsidies are you continuing to assume that the subsidy model will continue in 2020 or some relief is in there to get to your guidance and i have a follow up question on wireless please tony staffieri chief financial officer okay i ll start with those two maher in terms of our performance for the fourth quarter we reported adjusted ebitda growth of 1 it s important to keep in mind that that 1 is inclusive of the ifrs lease accounting impact year on year which we ve said is about 3 points of impact year on year so you ought to think about it as we go into each of the quarters in 2020 the lease accounting impact will be an apples to apples in terms of year on year and you can remove that 3 point adjustment so in the first quarter so in the fourth quarter that 1 equates to an ifrs adjusted number for lease of negative 2 and so that s the important factor to keep in mind for the first half of 2020 in terms of our outlook for subsidy as joe mentioned by the end of this month and into the first week in february we ve announced that we will retire the subsidy plans and move to all instalment equipment instalment plans we think that s the right approach for the customer and as part of that we think we ll continue to see reductions in subsidy costs as the value proposition focuses on the connectivity rates in the plans and unlimited and worry free overage plans in fido in terms of our outlook in our plan we haven t necessarily relied on that to happen in order for us to hit our ebitda guidance and so we think that s a big opportunity for the industry and we ll need to see how the competitive dynamics play out but we are primarily focused on other cost playbook initiatives in order to be within our guidance range on ebitda maher yaghi desjardins analyst i m with you tony on the ifrs 16 impact but when you look at your 2019 guidance of 3 to 5 and removing that impact of ifrs 16 you re basically calling for the same kind of ebitda growth in 2020 versus 2019 so again i m going back to trying to figure out you guys talked about the second half improvement and the gain that you expect to get from the launch of unlimited and the cost benefit and so from the guidance that you re giving in 2020 it doesn t seem like we re at the point to begin to benefit from that transition so when is that benefit going to be fully reflected as we re looking at 2021 now tony staffieri chief financial officer again couple of things just a level set for the full year 2019 we had flat revenue and ebitda growth of 4 adjusting for lease we had ebitda growth of 1 for the full year and as we saw it play out it was really a tale of two stories in 2019 first half and second half and what you saw in the second half was declining topline and declining ebitda and compared to what you saw in the first half of 2019 and so we re reiterating the same type of approach for 2020 in reverse we ll continue to see a drag on topline as well as ebitda for the first half of the year and then we expect to see growth in the back half and we want to be cautious about how we see that growth it will depend on a number of dynamics and in particular competitive dynamics in the marketplace and what is a very busy period and so we think our guidance appropriately reflects the type of quarterly and first half back half skew that we ve previously talked about maher yaghi desjardins analyst okay and on sorry on wireless you had a nice quarter in terms of loading postpaid customers i guess there is a there was a lot of subsidies there were a lot of gift cards going around in the fourth quarter i would have thought your arpu would have been more effective than what it showed up in the results can you talk a little bit about the quality of the customers you re getting and how that arpu number came out to where it was showing some improvement sequentially tony staffieri chief financial officer sure a couple of things maher would be helpful on that first i ll start with the quality of the customers coming in we were very pleased with the lifetime value as well as the arpu in if you were to look at one of the things i ve talked about before is we look at arpu in and it s up year on year and when i say arpu i mean ifrs arpu obviously arpu is up as we have more device attach rates but meaningfully arpu is up year on year and the lifetime value of the customers coming in is up significantly so we re very pleased with the mix of customers that made up not only the postpaid net but also the gross additions that we had in the wireless business q4 was as always extremely competitive but what we did see when you step back and look at all in promotional subsidy and promotional costs for the quarter they were actually down year on year on a cash basis and so you saw some of that bleed into our fourth quarter if you were to look at equipment net equipment subsidy costs they were down slightly year on year and as you know as a result of the amortization over the life of the contract you ll see more of that bleed in but if you step back and look at the economic cash basis it was down year on year again less than we would have targeted back in july but notwithstanding that still on a positive trajectory as we head into 2020 maher yaghi desjardins analyst okay thank you paul carpino vice president investor relations okay thanks maher thanks question ariel operator our next question comes from jeff fan of scotiabank jeff fan scotiabank analyst thank you good morning a couple of clarifications and then maybe a broader question clarification regarding the service revenue this quarter saw a bit of an improvement from last quarter last quarter was down minus 1 6 it was down only 1 this quarter tony based on your comment as we look out 2020 we are you expecting the first half given the seasonality of overage and other factors that it will be worse than the minus 1 and gets worse before it gets better on the inflection maybe just help us out in clarifying that the second clarification is just regarding the subsidies so you re planning to move subsidies out of your system but you haven t included it in your guidance so it sounds like you re not assuming that your competitors will just simply follow so for your contract asset which i guess picks up the subsidies are you assuming that s going to be roughly similar to 2019 is what you would likely see in 2020 and then just on the broader question as you kind of look at the competitive environment what we ve seen in the last quarter the last nine months or so and then looking out to 2020 is there any are there any plans to maybe consider altering your reporting to blend your post and prepaid subscribers and report phone just to kind of shift the focus away from pure loading and focus more on maybe the financials and service revenue etc i want to get your thoughts there thanks tony staffieri chief financial officer okay i ll start with first one jeff as you highlighted we had a bit of an improvement in the trajectory of service revenue so we re pleased with that as we look to the first half of 2020 you should expect about the same as what you saw in the fourth quarter q3 was a decline of almost 2 and it improved in the fourth quarter as we look to the first half as i said it will be we think about the same as we saw in q4 i want to be careful that we don t start to slide into quarterly guidance but at the same time we want to be very helpful in terms of first half and second half and so hopefully that will help you in terms of the subsidy two things to highlight one is moving away from the subsidy model construct to instalment plan isn t necessarily by itself about reducing the promotional discount if you will it s about making it simpler for the consumer so we re much more transparent in what the connectivity rate plan is versus what the cost of the handset is and so simplicity and transparency is really the focus there at the same time we have and will continue to reduce the amount of promotional discount that s inherent in the device pricing and so and that s true whether it s on the old subsidy rate plans or whether on instalment plans that is going to be highly market driven we ll need to do what we need to do to be competitive in the marketplace and so we ll see how that plays out as i said in the fourth quarter we saw a bit of a decline year on year and so within our plans for 2020 we ve assumed a very modest decline and i would describe it as not terribly significant to achieving our results our cost playbook is really centered around other factors and so that could be an incremental opportunity depending on how it plays out in the marketplace and then finally on your last question with respect to reporting and whether our focus goes back to some of the fundamentals let me start with first and foremost our fundamental we start with as always revenue ebitda and cash i mean that s really what we focus on and every quarter what we look at is revenue share and how we ve performed on revenue share and but for the overage decline i think what you would have seen is a very healthy track record of leading capturing leading share of revenue share and ebitda growth share so those are going to continue to be fundamental key first principles in terms of secondary leading metrics i don t want to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of what will provide at the end of q1 but i think there is merits to having some what i would describe minor modifications but still more to come on that front joe natale president and chief executive officer let me just add one comment jeff i mean if you look at the what drives underlying economics of our business as tony said revenue ebitda cash flow those core economics and share of revenue growth it s a combination of things as you know there our gross additions that come into our business roughly 1 6 million postpaid gross adds last year there are deactivations roughly 1 2 million deactivations and then as much as one third to one half of our base is going through either a price plan change or retention activity the quality of each of those transactions is what really drives the fundamentals of our business the quality of what comes in what goes out and the interactions throughout the course of the year around retention and adjustments is really what drives the fundamentals of revenue growth ebitda growth and cash flow growth so we ll continue to kind of point to the quality of those items increasingly pure net adds are only a small part of the story when you look at the broader picture of all the activity that goes on every single day jeff fan scotiabank analyst that s great thanks for the color paul carpino vice president investor relations great thanks jeff ariel we have time for two more questions please operator certainly our next question comes from drew mcreynolds of rbc drew mcreynolds rbc analyst yeah thanks very much good morning two housekeeping or maybe three housekeeping items for me on rogers media can you just speak to the dynamic of the higher programing costs in the quarter is that something that we ll see for 2020 and how should we overall be modeling rogers media second question on the cable ebitda margins certainly still continue to go in the right direction wondering if tony you can just comment on the drivers of that going forward in terms of further margin expansion with respect to either mix or certainly additional cost efficiencies and then lastly just on the capital return side of the equation can you just fine tune some comments in and around how you see the buyback and with respect to dividend growth i don t think anyone was certainly expecting growth another increase today but just what needs to come together to resume some dividend growth in the future thank you tony staffieri chief financial officer drew a couple of things i ll start with the media portion of it as you know it s always a bit lumpy media in terms of timing of programing costs vis a vis the revenue profile and so there s never a perfect matching with any month or quarter so as we look at 2020 you ought to think about media as good solid growth and we ve always talked about growth in media on a more consistent basis in the 2 range and that continues to be our outlook for media and you should expect margins and therefore ebitda growth to be somewhat more consistent again with some of the numbers you would have seen throughout 2019 when you exclude the impact of publishing and so again topline growth together with ebitda growth and some modest margin expansion in media on the second piece of it i ll come back to margin i just needed some clarification but on capital return again we reiterate that we re committed to cash return model we think from a balance sheet perspective we sit at a comfortable place in terms of liquidity leverage at 2 9 is a little more elevated but we comfortably burn that off in the normal course of our operations and growth and so with that in 2019 you saw some pretty healthy cash returns of cad655 million through share buybacks in addition to the dividends as we look to 2020 there are three factors that are top of mind for us as you would expect and one is the timing and pacing of our cash flow growth and so you can expect us to toggle it with that and we ve talked about the first half of the year being more muted in terms of growth the second piece of it relates to the upcoming spectrum auction and so we ll need to get further clarity on the timing of that and how we think about timing and quantum of share buybacks and the third is somewhat related to that is how we re naturally burning off our debt leverage ratio as well so those are sort of the three factors we think about in that and then on your second part on the margin expansion i m not sure i got the question if it related to all businesses or drew mcreynolds rbc analyst just the cable one tony tony staffieri chief financial officer yeah on the cable one two things we expect as joe said over the last several years we ve seen very good margin expansion on cable and it s really been on two fronts one is the indexing of more subscribers and therefore revenue to internet which is naturally a higher margin business together with some cost efficiency things that we ve continually been able to focus on and so as we look to 2020 we see continued improvements in ebitda margins and certainly at the cash margin level i ve talked about capex intensity continuing to move down for cable and that will contribute to we think a pretty good cable cash margin expansion in 2020 bear in mind we re going through drew we re going through another transition in cable we re going through the migration to ignite and we ended the year with 325 000 ignite customers and we also decided to stop sell our legacy solution we also as i mentioned in my comments upfront launched self install so we re trying to work our way through that transition with a lower capex cpe footprint given the inherent efficiencies of the new solution versus our legacy and dramatically different cpe footprint in terms of cost and we believe there s good opportunity on the self install front we know that other peers of ours who ve launched similar product are seeing good success on that front and just getting to that same level is of great inherent benefit to us so we re kind of working that calculus at the same time as just driving the overall performance of the business once we re in steady state with respect to the ignite transition there ll be we ve worked our way through that and that s goodness on many fronts drew mcreynolds rbc analyst great thank you paul carpino vice president investor relations okay thanks drew last call ariel operator certainly our final question comes from richard choe of j p morgan richard choe j p morgan analyst hi thank you wireless loadings were solid service revenue kind of came in better and broadband revenue came in better the only kind of weakness was on the video side but guidances for minus 2 to plus 2 for service revenue that seems pretty wide given the way the trends are pointing to is there something we re missing there tony staffieri chief financial officer richard i on the revenue side we a couple of things as we make the trends continue to make the transition to unlimited still a number of moving dynamics for us and frankly for the industry in terms of what may play out on the competitive front on the cable side we see good path to continued growth in 2020 but it s really the former that we wanted to leave ourselves room to make sure that we have the flexibility to do what we need to do in the marketplace in the short term to have the right long term results and so notwithstanding the fact that we provided what you would describe as a fairly broad range on service revenue i think the key point that we re trying to make in guidance is we will land ebitda within the somewhat narrow range that we provided and so i think that s really the important point that we d like you to walk away with richard choe j p morgan analyst great and one quick follow up there has been some i guess thoughts of a big upgrade cycle coming how much leeway have you provided yourself for your ebitda guidance for the year joe natale president and chief executive officer in terms of when you talk about the upgrade cycle i don t know if you re referring to perhaps a 5g migration or can you just clarify that richard what you re referring to richard choe j p morgan analyst a 5g iphone cycle joe natale president and chief executive officer yeah i think look as a couple of things on that it s not unlike what we saw from 3g to 4g in canada we sort of think about the migration is happening in normal course we might see a bit of heightened activity depending on the utility value for the customers but that s something will play out i would say we factored in some heightened activity but our expectation is it s not going to be something substantial in terms of when you look at it as a percentage of our total base in 2020 bear in mind richard that the iphone 11 was a very successful device and therefore the inherent activity and the subsidies around that high volume device are a part of the 2019 numbers that we re comparing against and we ll look carefully at what comes out of the device ecosystem and that will determine along with 5g capability the extent of that but i think we provided sufficient headroom for ourselves to function well in that particular launch paul carpino vice president investor relations great thanks
