what a difference a week can make in the forex market there were three big revelations the federal reserve doesn t expect to raise interest rates again this year europe is on the verge of recession and the uk received a short unsatisfying extension to article 50 as a result consolidations turned into breakouts as economic data and central bank policy gave investors a clearer sense of where the dollar euro and other currencies should head next the greenback ended the week sharply lower against the japanese yen but higher against the euro canadian and australian dollars at one point after the federal reserve meeting it looked like it could have been a week where all of the major currencies would be pushed higher by a depreciating us dollar however a less hawkish fed can only hurt the dollar so much when the bigger problem is weaker global growth looking ahead we expect that many of the new trends established last week will continue because while the economic calendar is busy the

levels support 109 00 resistance 112 00 fed cuts rate forecast from 2 to 0 hikes this year the biggest surprise last week came from the fed who made it clear that they no longer expect to raise this year and in doing so they set a strong downward course for which broke below 110 for the first time since early february back in december the fed forecasted 2 rate hikes this year and at worst investors thought they would downgrade those expectations to 1 hike however 11 out of 17 us policymakers think that rates should remain unchanged for the rest of the year this dramatic shift in expectations reflects the severity of the central bank s concerns according to the monetary policy statement the main problems are muted inflation slower household spending and business investment while the fed still feels that the labor market is strong and job gains are solid the deeper than expected slowdown and decline in inflation allows them the flexibility to keep monetary policy accommodative for the rest of the year fed chair powell confirmed that trade talks brexit european tariffs twin deficits and weaker global growth are risks and until some of these are lifted it s a great time for the fed to be patient to watch and wait although the fed chair laced part of his speech with optimism the greenback plunged as the lower interest rate gdp and inflation forecasts cast a

one of last week s best performers when the reserve bank of australia last met they made it clear that they are watching labor market and consumption while the unemployment rate dropped below 5 for the first time in 8 years the labor market is shrinking and job growth is slowing as full time jobs were shed last month investors are also worried that us china trade talks are going nowhere fast the us will be sending mnuchin and lighthizer to china next week for more trade talks but with reports that president trump wants china to double or triple their purchases of us goods an agreement still appears far away with both the rba and the fed on hold for the rest of the year the biggest driver of aud flows is risk appetite and the market s negative reaction to fomc forced aud to reverse its gains at the end of last week with no australian data on this week s calendar the market s appetite for risk and us dollars will drive aud usd flows the unexpected drop in canadian retail sales at the

economic reports weren t great with consumer confidence falling and service sector activity slowing however traders are hoping that improvements in other parts of the economy will be enough to keep the rbnz squarely neutral when the central bank met in february they pushed back their forecast for a rate increase to early 2021 but nzd soared after rbnz governor orr said the chance of easing has

gives uk two weeks or two months but that s it the uk prime minister may finally requested a three month extension of article 50 and the european union approved a delay but not the one she was looking for they said that if may can persuade parliament to accept the current withdrawal agreement the uk would leave the european union on may 22 one day before the european parliament elections however if she fails they have until april 12 in that time they will need to decide if the current deal no deal or no brexit is their next course of action the eu is telling the uk that for better or worse they want to be done with brexit they refuse to be trapped in a long extension unfortunately this means that a disruptive brexit is still on the table so while sterling ended the week off its lows the risk is to the downside brexit completely overshadowed the bank of england s monetary policy announcement and uk data the boe voted unanimously to leave interest rates unchanged and said brexit could prompt policy moves in either direction they also warned that employment growth could moderate significantly as more companies trigger no deal brexit plans instead of falling sterling rallied after the rate decision because the central bank said gradual limited tightening is probably needed uk retail sales wage growth and inflation reports were also stronger than expected however nothing

verge of recession while the us dollar should extend its slide against the japanese yen it could extend its gains against the euro as investors worry about europe teetering on the verge of recession the latest eurozone pmi numbers were horrible the flash pmi readings out of both france and germany missed their mark by a wide margin with german manufacturing pmi plunging to a 79 month low the german pmi was already projected to print at 48 below the 50 boom bust line but came in at a shockingly low of 44 7 suggesting that germany s key economic sector is now fully in a contractionary mode which likely to depress growth not only in germany but through the whole of ez as well german turned negative at one point as risk off flows picked up markedly this news only adds pressure on ecb not only to hold off on its normalization process but perhaps to completely reverse course and resume quantitative easing as credit conditions in the region have undoubtedly deteriorated the poor performance data from the ez core economies also puts european authorities at a massive disadvantage at a time when they can afford it the least the trump administration has been threatening the ez with import tariffs on cars which is a key industry in the region and would no doubt tip the continent into contraction should they be enacted mr trump ever ready to trample his opponents when they are down will no doubt harden his negotiation stance adding further economic pressure on europe all of this suggests that euro may now test the recent swing lows at the 1 12 and could even head to 1 10 as the year proceeds this in turn should actually help the export dependent region but the adjustment may take months and if exchange rates remain sticky at these levels growth will no doubt deteriorate further
by this past week on march 20 2019 federal reserve chairman jerome powell announced the us central bank would not raise interest rates in 2019 the fed s benchmark rate called the fed funds rate is thus frozen at 2 375 for the foreseeable future i e leaving the central bank virtually no room to lower rates in the event of the next recession which is now just around the corner the fed s formal decision to freeze rates follows powell s prior earlier january 2019 announcement that the fed was suspending its 2018 plan to raise rates three to four more times in 2019 that came in the wake of intense trump and business pressure in december to get powell and the fed to stop raising rates the administration had begun to panic by mid december as financial markets appeared in freefall since october treasury secretary steve mnuchin hurriedly called a dozen still unknown influential big capitalists and bankers to his office in washington the week before the christmas holiday with stock markets plunging 30 in just six weeks junk bond markets freezing up oil futures prices plummeting 40 etc it was beginning to look like 2008 all over again public mouthpieces for the business community in the media and business press were calling for trump to fire fed chair powell and trump on december 24 issued his strongest threat and warning to powell to stop raising rates to stop financial markets imploding further in early january in response to the growing crescendo of criticism powell announced the central bank would adopt a wait and see attitude whether or not to raise rates further the fed s prior announced plan in effect during 2017 18 to raise rates 3 to 4 more times in 2019 was thus swept from the table so much for perennial academic economist gibberish about central banks being independent or the fed s long held claim that it doesn t change policy in response to developments in financial markets this week s subsequent march 20 2019 fed announcement makes its unmistakenly official no more rate hikes this year and given the slowing us and global economies and upcoming election cycle next year there s essentially no rate hikes on the horizon in 2020 as well central bank interest rate policy is now essentially dead in the water in other words locked into a ceiling at 2 375 which makes it now a useless tool to address the next economic downturn around the corner the us economic slowdown has arrived for those who believe the business press and government spin that the us economy is doing great and recession is not just around the corner consider that us retail sales have fallen sharply in recent months in december they declined by 1 6 the biggest since september 2009 residential and commercial construction has been contracting throughout 2018 in january manufacturing led by autos dropped by 0 9 the manufacturing pmi indicator has hit a 21 month low despite trump s early 2018 multi trillion dollar business investor tax cuts investment in plant and equipment growth by year end slowed by two thirds over the course of 2018 recent surveys show ceo business confidence has declined the last four quarters in a row i e a bad omen for future business spending on equipment and inventories despite trump s trade wars the us trade deficit finished the year at a record 800 billion in the red service sector revenues rose a paltry 1 2 in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to the same period a year earlier and word is out that the us gdp for fourth quarter 2018 will soon be revised downward initially posted at 3 1 in february it was reduced to 2 6 next week in april it will be reduced still further to 1 8 or less according to jp morgan researchers meanwhile various bank research and other independent sources are predicting a 1st quarter 2019 us gdp of only 1 1 and possibly even less than 1 the economic scenario predicted by this writer a year ago is thus materializing trump s economy is clearly in trouble and now he s on an offensive to get the central bank not only to halt rate hikes but to start lowering interest rates before the end of this year and if powell doesn t comply watch for the trump and right wing to push for firing fed chair powell as well to head off trump investor offensive against the central bank fed chairman powell held an historically unprecedented public interview with the national 60 minutes tv show he attempted to placate trump and the growing attacks only fed chairman ben bernanke held a similar public interview during the worst depths of the collapse of the us economy in 2008 trump s latest tactic has been to nominate steven moore as a fed governor moore is one of those right winger economists affiliated with the heritage think tank he publicly called for trump to fire powell during the december near panic over the us stock market s plunge watch powell and the fed therefore drift over the course of 2019 to not just freezing fed rates but lowering them as well by year end monetary policy tools collapsing the current peaking of the fed s rate at 2 375 compares to a fed peak interest rate of 5 25 in 2007 just before the onset of the last recession a 6 5 peak on the eve of the preceding recession in 2000 and the 8 peak rate just before the 1991 recession in other words fed rate policy effectiveness has been deteriorating over the longer run for some time and not just recently that deterioration is traceable to fed policy since the 1980s which has been shifting from using interest rates to stabilize the economy low rates to stimulate economic growth higher rates to dampen inflation to a policy of ensuring long term low interest rates as a means for subsidizing banks businesses and capital incomes in general chronic low rates subsidize business profits by lowering borrowing costs and in addition by incentivizing corporations to also issue trillions of dollars of new low cost to them corporate bond debt money capital from the record profits and the cheap debt raised are then distributed to shareholders and managers via stock buybacks and dividend payouts which have averaged more than 1 trillion a year every year since 2010 and in 2018 alone hit a record 1 3 trillion but the chronic low rates are the originating source of it all i e the enabler while fed low rate policy has become a major means for subsidization of capital incomes after each business cycle the rates cannot be restored to their pre recession levels leaving the fed now with its mere 2 375 rate level as it enters the next recession the rate level at the end of the cycle ratchets down in other words the fed s interest rate gun is reloaded with fewer bullets it is now close to being out of ammunition beyond quantitative easing qe the declining effectiveness of interest rate policy has forced the fed at least in part to develop another monetary tool the past decade so called quantitative easing qe the introduction of qe in 2009 in the us and earlier by the bank of japan which originated the idea should be viewed in part therefore as a desperate attempt to create a new tool as interest rates have become increasingly ineffective at stopping or even slowing a business cycle contraction or at stimulating an economic recovery from recession with qe the central bank goes directly to investors and buys up their bad debt by providing them virtually free money at ultra low 0 1 rates qe is therefore about the fed transferring the bad debt from investors and banks balance sheets directly onto the fed s own balance sheet but that subsidization via debt off loading and low long term rates also reduces the effectiveness of monetary policy performing its historic role of economic stabilization i e stimulating economic growth or dampening inflation during the period 2009 to 2016 the fed s qe program transferred between 4 5 trillion to 5 5 trillion from investors to its own balance sheet and if one counts other major central banks in europe japan and china the amount of debt offloaded from bankers and investors to central banks amounted to between 20 to 25 trillion to prepare for the next business cycle crash and recession the fed and other central banks in recent years announced they would begin to sell off their bloated balance sheet debt the purpose was to clean up the central bank s balance sheet so it could absorb and transfer even more corporate investor bad debt to itself during the next crash this debt sell off was called quantitative tightening or qt the fed was first among central banks to begin the sell off with a token 30 billion a month other central banks in europe declared they too would do so but have since abandoned the pretense the bank of japan with its t to 5t debt never even pretended so the world s central banks remain bloated with tens of trillions of dollars equivalent in off loaded corporate investor debt from the last crisis of 2008 09 and face the prospect of even tens of trillions more and possibly much more in the next crisis however powell further announced on march 20 that the fed will also halt by september 2019 its qt sell off like interest rate policy qe qt policy is also likely now dead in the water can the fed add 5t to 10t more in qe come the next crisis and the world s major central banks add another 30t more in addition to their current 20t perhaps but not likely doubling qe and fed balance sheet debt is not any more likely than the fed significantly lowering interest rates come the next crisis even less so for the europeans and japanese whose interest rates are already less than zero i e negative central banks as capital incomes subsidization vehicles what s becoming increasingly clear is that in the 21st century capitalist economies the us and others are having increasing difficulty generating profits and real investment from normal business activity consequently they are turning to their capitalist states to subsidize their bottom line central banks have become a major engine of such subsidization of profits and capital incomes but that subsidization function is in turn destroying central banks ability to perform their historic role to stimulate economic growth and or dampening inflation the latter historic functions deteriorate and decline as the new subsidization of profits and capital incomes become increasingly paramount the historic functions and the new function of central banks as engines of capital subsidization are in other words mutually exclusive the same subsidization by the state is evident in fiscal policy especially tax policy once the fed started raising rates in late 2016 the policy shifted from monetary tools to subsidize capital in comes to fiscal tax policy as primary means of subsidization since 2001 in the us alone business and investor and wealthy households have been provided by the capitalist state with no less than 15 trillion in tax reductions like low rates qe that too has mostly found its way into stock buybacks dividend payouts mergers acquisitions etc which have fueled in turn unprecedented financial asset market bubbles in stocks bonds derivatives foreign exchange speculation and property values since 2000 and by such transmission mechanisms the accelerating income and wealth inequality trends in the us and elsewhere business investor tax cutting as subsidization vehicle while subsidization via tax cutting has been going on since reagan it accelerated since 2000 under bush and continued under obama but it has accelerated still further under trump the impact of the trump tax cuts is most evident on 2018 fortune 500 profits no less than 22 of the 27 rise in 2018 in fortune 500 profits has been estimated as due to the windfall of the trump tax cuts for businesses and corporations the total subsidization of business investors over the next decade due to the trump tax cuts is no less than 4 5 trillion offset by 1 5 trillion increase in taxes on middle class households and trump s phony assumptions about gdp growth that reduces the 4 5 trillion further to a fictitious 1 5 trillion negative hit to the us budget the subsidization via tax cutting has also generated record us budget deficits and national debt levels that have been doubling roughly every decade from roughly 5 trillion in 2000 to 10 11 trillion by 2010 to 22 trillion by 2019 with projections to 34 37 trillion or more by 2030 roughly 60 of the us budget deficits and debt are attributable to tax policy and loss of tax revenues bail ins next generation monetary tool long touted by mainstream economists as tools of stabilization and growth in reality both central bank monetary policy rates qe etc and government fiscal policy business investor tax cuts have been steadily morphing into means of subsidization of capital incomes having become so the ability of both monetary central bank and fiscal policy to address the next major crisis could prove extremely disappointing monetary policies of low interest rates and even qe are now played out as they say and with us debt at 22 5 trillion going to 34 trillion or more by 2027 fiscal policy as means to stimulate the economy is also seriously compromised so what are the likely policy responses the next recession on the monetary side watch for what is called bail ins the banks and investors will be bailed out next time by forcing depositors to convert their cash savings in the banks to worthless bank stock that s a plan in the us and uk already on the books and awaiting implementation a plan that has already been piloted in europe on the fiscal tax side watch for a renewed intensive attack on social security medicare education food stamps housing support and all the rest of social programs that don t directly boost corporate profits the outlines are clear in trump s just released most recent budget projecting 2 7 trillion in such cuts and of course trump co will continue to propose still more tax cuts which has already begun in a number of forms in other words as both monetary and fiscal policy become increasingly ineffective in the 21st century as means to address recessions and or restore economic growth they are simultaneously being transformed instead into tools for subsidizing capital incomes during before and after economic crises
published monday 25 march 2019 print disqus by keith weiner monetary metals last week i ranted about the problem with our monetary system and trajectory falling interest rates is keynes evil genius plan to destroy civilization this week i continue the theme if in a more measured tone addressing the ideas predominant among the groups who are most likely to fight against keynes destructionism they are the capitalists the gold bugs and the otherwise free marketers i do not write this to attack any particular people nor indeed as an attack at all my purpose comes from my belief that to fix a problem one must understand the nature of the problem i highlight these groups because if there is ever to be a real movement to reform our monetary system it would come from one of these groups or ideally an alliance among all three however that is not in the cards today let s look at why not the capitalists first are the capitalists by capitalist i do not mean those who advocate an unregulated unshackled unfettered unrestricted uncontrolled laissez faire social system in which each man is free to produce and trade with others i mean those who make money who enjoy making money and defend the making of money this group is represented by wall street the one percent or the fat cats indelibly seared into my own brain is the q a with then president of the dallas federal reserve dick fisher someone asked him about the wealth effect the term economists use to describe the increase in spending and hence gdp when asset prices rise he said expansively well let me just say that the wealthy have been very affected the room full of one percenters and aspiring one percenters gave a nice bit of applause to this statement for all that many wall streeters play at criticizing the fed they want the same thing that the fed wants they want smoothly rising asset prices so they can safely use maximum leverage to make their bets and maximize their profits they will happily use and thereby reinforce whatever measures paint a picture of a good economy because a good economy justifies rising asset prices for example if gdp goes up then that should be good for stocks and real estate it needs to be said if you break a window or the government borrows money to dole out welfare it adds to gdp this is not a recommendation for breaking windows or doling welfare it is a damning indictment of gdp as a measure of the economy unfortunately the capitalists are not receptive to this argument or the discussion of keynes evil plan above upton sinclair explains why not it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it also and this is a not inconsiderable force no one likes to be told that the basis of his career is to profiteer on an illegitimate regime it is much easier to deny the illegitimacy i e argue it s legitimate than to confront that uncomfortable truth the gold bugs let s move on to the gold bugs are the gold bugs among the one in a million who see the root of the problem or do they see the capitalists getting rich and want the same for themselves they see stocks and bonds and real estate going up and the capitalists profiteering from it they just want their preferred asset gold to go up they confuse the gold standard with gold going up as the capitalists traffic in the collectivist faux measures like gdp the gold bugs traffic in the conspiracy theories such as libya was going to lead an african gold standard china is about to make the yuan gold backed the world is rejecting the dollar as reserve currency or the international monetary fund is going to impose a new global currency that will be partially gold backed the capitalists promote gdp because they think it will help conventional asset prices go up the gold bugs promote conspiracy theories because they think it will help gold go up i will conclude this section with a headline as i recall it that made the rounds a year or two ago nuclear war in korea will be good for gold those who traffic in such views are not thinking about reforming the monetary system or horrors of nuclear war they are thinking of getting rich gaining more of the very dollars they tell you will be worthless by tomorrow morning the otherwise free marketers last let s look at the otherwise free marketers i use this term for people who advocate free markets except in money and credit milton friedman was the archetype here is friedman in the case for flexible exchange rates the argument for a flexible exchange rate is strange to say very nearly identical with the argument for daylight savings time isn t it absurd to change the clock in summer when exactly the same result could be achieved by having each individual change his habits all that is required is that everyone decide to come to his office an hour earlier have lunch an hour earlier etc but obviously it is much simpler to change the clock that guides all than to have each individual separately change his pattern of reaction to the clock even though all want to do so the situation is exactly the same in the exchange market it is far simpler to allow one price to change namely the price of foreign exchange than to rely upon changes in the multitude of prices that together constitute the internal price structure this was a few pages after he declared that wage rates tend to be among the less flexible prices so the man who is widely believed to stand for people being free to choose is arguing in essence that it s better for the ministry of time to change the public s clock than for people be free to choose what time to open their offices he and his ideological successors today may stand for eliminating tariffs lower minimum wages and repealing rent control but when it comes to money and credit they have a huge blind spot when it comes to an actual free market they think a free banking system can be built on top of a base of fiat currency and a central bank as one prominent economist said to an audience in which i sat the only real debate among the otherwise free market economists is whether the central bank should adhere to a fixed rate of increase of the quantity of dollars what friedman called the k rule whether it should have a strict policy of price stability an orwellian phrase which means chronic 2 rising prices whether it should have its current dual manage of prices and unemployment whether it should follow some more complex formula such as the taylor rule or whether it should follow an alternative simple rule such as maintaining a fixed rate of gdp growth why do they hold this assumption that money depends on government unlike food and clothing and medicine and iphones which obviously don t it s not that there is no theory of money that argues that money is not a product of the state the assumption derives in part from an unshakeable faith in the so called business cycle this view holds that a free market is prone to cycles of boom followed by bust in this view a free market free from all government interference which is commonly but not exclusively monetary and monetary interference is commonly but not exclusively by a central bank has an intrinsic tendency to excesses of both growth and contraction central planning to correct capitalism s boom bust cycle this view that capitalism has an inherent cycle was promoted by leninist economist nikolai kondratiev when lenin died and stalin took over kondratiev s idea got him into trouble though a marxist his view of cycles was against the orthodoxy a true stalinist communist believes that capitalism collapses once and finally it does not recover for more cycles so comrade kondratiev was sent to gulag and eventually killed this same view of cycles is promoted today by the otherwise free marketers the idea of cycles does not necessarily mean a central planner must smooth out such cycles however it is an important justification and tends to lead most adherents to that view if cycles come from free markets then surely the central planner can smooth them out somehow it was for this reason that they created the federal reserve in 1913 and it is for this reason that the fed and its interference in markets are still justified today most of the otherwise free marketers are against gold they sense as do the overt socialists and central planners that gold stands in opposition to central planning as alan greenspan wrote in 1966 that gold and economic freedom are inseparable that the gold standard is an instrument of laissez faire and that each implies and requires the other however let s move on to a group promotes a synthesis of central planning and gold their root economic error is to mistake redemption for purchase back in the days of the gold standard one deposited a dollar s worth of gold and had the right to redeem a dollar s worth of gold this was not a price it was merely the standard for coins and bank deposits it is akin to an internet standard that says a certain kind of packet should be 512 bytes it is not dictating the length of a message just that longer messages must be broken up for the sake of efficient handling by internet routers but this group seeks to have the fed impose not a constant rate of inflation nor to create a constant rate of growth but a constant price of gold like all price fixing schemes it will fail when the market moves against it the otherwise free marketers do not address any of the allegations i have made against the regime of irredeemable currency i have written tens of thousands of words arguing that debt necessarily grows exponentially and tens of thousands more on the unhinged interest rate which rose relentlessly until 1981 and which has been falling ever since the falling interest rate causes many ills and is the embodiment of keynes brilliantly evil plan to destroy the capitalist order euthanize the rentier i e savers and investors and lull the capitalists into supporting it because the process makes them feel richer and richer as they consume their capital in an endless orgy of endlessly rising asset prices if somebody doesn t do something we will reach keynes long run that s when he conceded we re all dead monetary metals is doing something paying interest on gold is the path to once again using gold as a medium of exchange supply and demand fundamentals the prices of the monetary metals rose 11 and 27 this week the supply and demand fundamentals is the shortest section of this report this is because the actual data can be seen in a simple chart for each metal if central banks were really buying mass quantities of gold in anticipation of a new gold based global monetary system or india were really importing all marketable gold or the mainstream american public were desperately trading its dollars for gold or china were really buying up all the physical gold to prepare for a gold backed yuan while selling paper gold natch then the data would show this mount saint helens was quiescent for a long time until all of a sudden in 1980 it went wild with activity there was an earthquake then steam venting then the side of the mountain began to bulge then a second earthquake triggered that side to collapse then the volcano finally exploded the time from the first earthquake to the massive eruption was two months we haven t done the research but we d bet an ounce of fine gold against a soggy dollar bill that there were plenty of indications shown by sensitive seismographs for months prior the earthquake it is the same with gold price skyrocketing which is just another way of saying dollar collapse you won t need to read about improbabilities like the world s central banks desiring to give up power and move to gold or mechanically impossible things like china retroactively declaring its currency to be gold backed you will see it in the rumbling that becomes a sea change of attitudes the earthquake of numerous big bankruptcies and then the collapse of many dollar derivative currencies one day the volcano will explode however today is not that day said aragorn in the meantime we can watch the seismograph which is the gold basis and there are other seismographs like the spread between junk and treasury bonds which has been moving up since the start of the month and is now close to the high made at the start of the year if this spread is rising it signals growing fear that high yield bonds will actually pay the investors capital back so you see selling of junk buying of treasurys and treasury bond yields are falling falling back into their decades long trend which is a falling trend sorry we had to go for the pun a 10 year treasury now pays 2 5 while 10 year german japanese government bonds pay negative that is you pay to lend euros or yen to them 10 year british gilts are now down to 1 the swiss yield is the most negative of all the capitalists and otherwise free marketers will tell you well you see actually what had happened was actually you should look at real yields aren t negative to which the gold bugs will say oh yes they are we must say that whatever the word for a hypothetical construct which does not exist real is not that word the interest rate that lenders are paid is negative who cares what a dismal model produced by the dismal science says so the fact remains keynesian rot has advanced beyond where keynes predicted or perhaps intended he said yield should be zero and even generously allowed a tiny positive number to compensate the manager for his investment efforts and now it s negative in several major currencies euthanasia occurs even faster at negative yields than at zero at some point the sepsis of this disease will matter we are not merely saying what goes up must come down which is an expression of a malevolent universe premise there is no economic law that says achievement must be undone successful must lead to failure production must turn to ruin the economic law is that if you render destruction profitable then sooner or later you hollow out too much of the capital on which your civilization depends anyways let s look at the only true picture of the supply and demand fundamentals of gold and silver but first here is the chart of the prices of gold and silver next this is a graph of the gold price measured in silver otherwise known as the gold to silver ratio see here for an explanation of bid and offer prices for the ratio it was down a hair this week here is the gold graph showing gold basis cobasis and the price of the dollar in terms of gold price the scarcity cobasis of gold did not rise so whatever buying drove up the price was not a pyroclastic flow of the biggest volcano in american history it was a tepid little flow of an ordinary creek wending its way still the monetary metals gold fundamental price eked out another gain up 15 to 1 512 now let s look at silver if the scarcity of gold did not rise that of silver fell noticeably and the monetary metals silver fundamental price fell 31 cents to 15 99 we read this week a story touting a big sale of silver to china if it were true at all then it could mean that a large seller of silver was looking for a bid to dump the metal on every transaction has a buyer and a seller there s a common fallacy to assume that the big famous party is the one driving the deal but what really matters is whether the buyer took the offer price or the seller accepted the bid wednesday was a big day for silver with the price moving up around 20 at 2pm edt or 18 00 in london it seems the fed surprised everyone said what we have been saying for years that they will stop hiking rates of course they will what choice have they got here is a graph of wednesday s action in both price and basis for silver hours prior to the big price fed announcement and price move we see the basis rising first starting around 12 00 gmt there is rising price and basis speculators may have been getting ahead of the fed s anticipated announcement then at 13 300 price drops back down but basis continues to rise folks this is selling of physical metal do the math basis future spot how else to explain falling price and rising basis then when fed announcement hit price shoots up rapidly and basis which had been subsiding shoots up to a new level with the price the price move was buyers in the futures market the day began with silver at 15 30 and the basis at 55bps it ends at 15 50 and 25bps 2019 monetary metals digg this article published monday 25 march

it lost in the last two sessions 5 4 before the weekend as the fear over the decline in reserves were eased by officials though the central bank did not conduct its normal fx swap auction asia pacific fresh news from the region is light the focus has been on the decline in equities and yields the nikkei s 3 loss is the largest of the year it gapped lower and finished below previous resistance near 21000 the first important retracement target of this year s rally is found near in the 20750 area the nikkei recovery after the q4 18 slide stalled in front of the 200 day moving average 21960 twice once at the beginning of march and again last week before the weekend markit reported that japan s flash manufacturing pmi for march was unchanged at 48 9 in contraction territory earlier today japan confirmed the poor start to the year with the third consecutive decline in the all industries activity index the 0 2 decline was a little better than expected but the december reading was revised to 0 6 from 0 4 the japanese economy contracted in q3 18 and staged a mild recovery in q4 but looks to be contracting again although finance minister aso recently reaffirmed plans to hike the sales tax later this year an economic contraction would justify postponing it again thailand initially delayed releasing the results of the weekend election the first since the 2014 coup while the opposition party pheu thai looks to have picked up seats in the lower chamber of parliament the political arm of the military palang pracharath appears to have won the thai baht is the best performing currency in asia today 0 3 and this year 3 1 for the record the chinese yuan is the second strongest in the region this year with a 2 5 gain through the end of last week foreign investors have sold about 350 mln of thai equities and about 365 mln in thai bonds this year the dollar made a marginal new low against the yen and the rebound back above jpy110 it is testing the resistance encountered before the weekend in north america and again in asia near jpy110 20 however the intraday technicals are getting stretched before the us open and there are two large maturing options today the first set is for 1 9 bln at jpy110 there is another roughly 805 mln at jpy110 25 the australian dollar approached last week s lows 0 7065 before stabilizing resistance is seen in the 0 7100 0 7120 area europe the german ifo surprised on the upside the march survey was not only better than expected but the february results were revised higher the business climate improved to 99 6 from a revised 98 7 initially 98 5 the expectations component rose to 95 6 from a revised 94 0 from 93 8 the overall current conditions measure was 103 8 after 103 6 from 103 4 the euro traded at session highs a little above 1 1320 on the news it is not enough to offset the poor flash pmi but may dull it a bit the turkish lira slumped 5 4 ahead of the weekend it was the fourth consecutive week that the lira managed to post a single session of gains a large drawdown in reserves prompted concern that the politically compromised central bank was supporting the currency ostensibly ahead of local elections officials played down the significance of the decline in reserves largely commercially based making foreign exchange available to state owned business the government also indicated it has opened an investigation into a bank s report with a bearish view of the lira the lira is recovering today and is up about 2 the try5 52 area is about the middle of this year s range it is currently about try5 64 the brexit drama continues reports over the weekend that a group of cabinet ministers was going to try to oust prime minister may appears to have been blocked changing governments does not make up for the lack of a majority in parliament it is not clear at this juncture whether the withdrawal bill will indeed be voted on the third time there will be a series of indicative votes to see the sense of the house of commons but it only makes sense if it is a free vote that the party whips don t control one of the few definite things in this very fluid situation is that the uk will not be leaving the eu at the end of the week as initially intended a petition to revoke article 50 has garnered more than 5 mln votes but this does not appear to be the most likely course in the 2016 referendum those that voted to leave numbered around 17 mln there is also much talk about a second referendum this was resoundingly defeated in the house of commons and does not yet look particularly likely the euro reached almost 1 1450 on the back of the dovish fed in the middle of last week it briefly dipped below 1 1275 ahead of the weekend in response to the dismal flash pmi helped by the ifo survey the euro has stabilized to start the new week the intraday technical indicators are stretched before the us open initial resistance is in the 1 1320 area and a firmer hurdle is seen in the 1 1340 1 1360 area support now is seen a little below 1 1300 sterling poked above the pre weekend high 1 3225 in early asia and tried again in the european morning there is an unusually large sterling option gbp1 6 bln struck at 1 3200 expires today and another one gbp1 3 bln at 1 3250 that will also be cut support is pegged near 1 3160 it remains vulnerable to headline risk america the inversion of the us yield curve 3 month to 10 year has been a fairly good indicator of a recession but there are two caveats first the curve must stay inverted a drive by does not count second the lead time can be more than a year while it is always dangerous to assume things are different this time the context does matter there two aspects that make it usual first the drop in us yields took place after the poor eurozone pmi the german bund yield went negative for the first time in three years the increase in negative yielding instruments makes us treasuries more attractive nearly regardless of one s macroeconomic views second there are unusual supply considerations us government debt managers are issuing more debt at the shorter end of the curve consider this week s supply the us government will raise 350 bln this week there will be about 208 bln of bills hitting the market and 142 bln of coupons the economic calendar is light today the chicago fed reports its national activity index for february and the richmond fed reports its march manufacturing index neither are market movers even in the best of times with the fomc meeting over the quiet period has ended and fed officials will hit the news wires evans has already spoken

middle of the week and january monthly gdp at the end of the week the us dollar tested cad1 3440 the high from march 11 in asia and has trended lower toward cad1 3400 in the european morning we look for it to find support near there risk off ahead of the weekend saw the mexican peso fall almost 1 25 its largest loss of the year president amlo indicated that his government will not act to address bank fees and that banks ought to regulate themselves the peso is recouping some of its pre weekend losses but the dollar may find support near mxn19 00
while the world focuses on the us and china britain s exit from the european union g3 monetary policy and europe s doldrums little attention is being paid to economic and financial developments in latin america yet change is afoot the international monetary fund is stepping up activities in the region argentina is the fund s largest engagement with around half of a 57bn programme already disbursed the country is undergoing by necessity a tough fiscal austerity drive president mauricio macri s administration in hindsight far too gradually restrained borrowing in its early days only to see argentina hit by adverse shifts in global market conditions jeopardising market access recession ensued but the economy is beginning to show signs of growth inflation however remains persistent and the central bank just raised interest rates amid a renewed decline in the peso argentina is keeping its programme on track on 11 march the imf board approved a 4 2bn extended programme for ecuador the previous rafael correa led government spent excessively amid oil price declines and a rising dollar undermining competitiveness and putting pressure on the dollarised economy it borrowed excessively to fill the gap the new government had little alternative but to pursue a more orthodox stabilisation policy course the new programme will seek to cut back on borrowing and deficits by boosting fiscal sustainability and competitiveness thus strengthening ecuador s dollarisation as is the fund s welcome standard operating practice under managing director christine lagarde it also includes measures to protect the poor and fight corruption venezuela s economic collapse looms large over latin america with nicol√°s maduro still holding the reins the imf is engaged from afar in contingency planning with other institutions such as the world bank and inter american development bank preparing for the day when venezuela may have a legitimate government and counterparts on the ground for the fund to deal with the imf hasn t been able to set foot in caracas for more than a decade its knowledge about the venezuelan economy is highly limited and the quality of what little data it receives from the country is suspect if there is a proper transition massive humanitarian assistance will be the initial order of the day the imf will first wish to inject emergency assistance presumably through its rapid financing instrument though the permissible sums under fund rules are not great critically the fund will also need to begin gathering data on the ground meet the economic team and develop a medium term economic and financial plan that will need to encompass policy reforms import rehabilitation needs including in the oil sector and requisite financing such as official multilateral and bilateral inflows and debt relief a plan will take time to develop and would probably be supported through an imf extended arrangement venezuela s debt restructuring may make argentina s look easy by comparison mexico has a 75bn contingent flexible credit line arrangement with the imf extending through the end of november the new government under president andr√©s manuel l√≥pez obrador is committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability including a primary surplus and seems comfortable with central bank independence and the banco de m√©xico s first rate team however other l√≥pez obrador statements and actions are bruising investor confidence recent credit downgrades of pemex mexico s state owned oil company highlight that the country faces potential future fiscal pressures and contingent liabilities only platinum performers qualify for the flexible credit lines as mexico s fcls of the past decade testify the country has consistently been such a performer the new government will need to decide if it still wants the fcl after november for its part the fund will need to develop relations with the new mexican team and assess their commitment to upholding platinum policies given the pemex downgrades and market ruminations about possible sovereign downgrades mexico may well want a further fcl extension to avoid a global investor selloff colombia also has long had a fcl and the current line totals nearly 11bn and extends through may 2020 colombia s record of macroeconomic management in past years has been exemplary but it is on the front lines of the venezuelan crisis and colombia s noble humanitarian support for refugees is adding significantly to the country s fiscal burdens as recently concluded by the fund colombia faces the hurdle of being mindful of future fiscal and external competitiveness challenges while tackling structural rigidities ironically while these latin developments are afoot a new brazilian government is working on tough pension and budget reforms many of which the fund has long called for and all analysts agree are essential for restoring fiscal sustainability but the imf seemingly has few relationships with brazil s new economic team in addition the team s policy orientation seems decidedly to the right of the imf s in terms of maintaining effective social protections imf activity in latin america is percolating the fund has a much better reputation with the region s leadership than in the past while it may not be on the radar screen of a world mesmerised by donald trump xi jinping theresa may and

yes we need to move urgently but we ve learned a lot about how to do that since the 1930s we ve come a long way since ken bone in the three presidential debates of 2016 just one question was asked about energy thanks to the famous red sweater wearing undecided voter from illinois not a single question was asked about climate change and discussion of climate change totaled just five minutes that was mind you five more than in all the 2012 presidential debates the 2020 election has just started and already climate change is a first tier issue the green new deal which nearly every prospective democratic nominee has embraced has given climate change the urgency the issue deserves backed by a sweeping agenda that makes an ambitious platform like bernie sanders s embrace of a carbon tax in 2016 suddenly seem feeble the green new deal should also be celebrated because unlike most climate plans to date it actually engages ken bone s question mr bone a coal plant worker asked how we could meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers for far too long concerns of workers dislocated by climate action have been an afterthought but the green new deal places them front and center which is both good policy and politics predictably the right has caricatured the green new deal as a socialist scheme to ban airplanes and hamburgers still others have attacked it for polarizing the politics of climate change being too costly or lacking pragmatism and others have criticized it for going well beyond the remit of climate policy guaranteeing good paying jobs affordable and safe housing high quality health care and much more assessing these attacks requires placing the green new deal in the context of the shifting political and planetary contexts of our time when it comes to government the share of the american public that favors a more energized and active role has grown sharply a 2018 nbc wall street journal survey found 58 percent of americans agree government should do more to solve problems and help meet the needs of people an all time high and a 2018 gallup poll found 62 percent of americans say government is doing too little to help the environment compared to 46 percent in 2010 meanwhile when it comes to addressing climate change policy approaches that were pragmatic and moderate a decade or two ago are simply no longer adequate decades of inaction mean the imperative to act boldly is today far more urgent at the same time the current debate about the green new deal presents a false choice between free market approaches and world war ii style mobilization some progressive advocates frame the green new deal in backward looking terms rather than in ways that acknowledge how the economy has changed and government has evolved and reflect the lessons that have been learned about good policy design since world war ii the proper measure of climate policy ambition is not size of government programs or spending the regulatory state that has emerged since world war ii provides a range of smarter policy tools moreover experience with those tools has taught that leveraging market incentives and spurring technological innovation will achieve our policy goals more effectively and at lower cost government can harness the tremendous innovative potential in the private sector through good policy rather than do the work itself that many creative companies are already doing at the same time concerns about environmental justice just transition and equity must be elevated in climate policy considerations as the green new deal does even if the best policies to solve the climate crisis will not also solve our health care housing or jobs problems which must be addressed with their own policy solutions as this essay explains giving meaning to the ambition of the green new deal requires policy solutions that embrace both the virtues of our market based economic system and a more robust role for government to deliver the market outcomes we desire including social justice and environmental protection the imperative of climate action it is painfully evident that it will be nearly impossible to meet the targets for limiting temperature rise to which nearly all nations have agreed and the evolving science suggests even those targets may cause harms worse than previously understood the planet has already heated up by 1 degree celsius above pre industrial times in response the impacts of climate change are already being felt including the fastest decline in arctic sea ice in 1 500 years more damaging extreme weather events and rising sea levels left unchecked from 2000 to 2100 global average temperature increases of 2 to 5 celsius 3 6 to 9 fahrenheit and sea level rise of two to four feet are likely while much larger increases are possible climate change will reduce long run economic growth and jeopardize national security even if climate goals are achieved some damage is already baked in in october the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change released a report detailing the severity of climate change impacts with 1 5 degrees warming and how much worse they would be with 2 degrees at 2 degrees warming more than one third of the global population will be exposed to a severe heat event at least once every five years the arctic will be free of ice once every ten years the risk of worse and more frequent droughts is significantly higher at 2 degrees than at 1 5 degrees and the same is true for heavy rains and flooding gdp growth species loss ocean rise food security and human health bear in mind that we are nowhere close to being on track to keep warming to 2 degrees let alone 1 5 degrees as a recent report from the united nations environment programme makes clear at current emission rates the carbon budget to achieve the 1 5 degree target is used up in around 15 years after that emissions would need to fall to zero immediately if emissions begin falling sharply now achieving 1 5 degrees warming would require that we achieve net zero emissions by around 2050 zero even as we continue to power the world s rising number of cars trucks factories air conditioners heating units lights refrigerators appliances airplanes ships computers and much much more indeed the amount of carbon dioxide the global population is putting in the atmosphere is still increasing each and every year electric vehicle adoption has been growing rapidly with the global ev fleet expanding nearly fivefold over the past three years while battery costs have fallen by 80 percent since 2010 still the world consumes around 100 million barrels per day mbd of oil and that volume is projected to rise 1 4 mbd this year even under more optimistic projections of ev deployment oil demand still grows for years to come as more people in emerging markets own cars and consume more goods delivered by freight trucks and produced with petrochemicals similarly while renewable energy costs are falling sharply and renewable generation growing rapidly global electricity demand is outpacing that growth in emerging markets leading coal use to rise last year as well worldwide there are still more than 450 coal plants under construction or planned two thirds of them in china india and southeast asia so clean energy costs have fallen and deployment grown more than nearly any expert predicted a decade ago would be possible and yet the use of oil gas and coal has risen as well our climate change conversation often fails to acknowledge that these two things can both be true at the same time there is much to celebrate in the pace of clean energy progress and reason for optimism about what lies ahead but that does not mean the world is anywhere close to being on track to achieve its climate targets achieving our climate goals means not merely meeting incremental energy demand growth with low carbon energy but replacing the roughly 80 percent of the global energy mix today that still comes from fossil fuels starting with coal to limit warming to 2 degrees emissions would need to start falling rapidly achieving 1 5 degrees warming at this point is technically feasible but for all practical purposes virtually impossible guiding the invisible hand achieving the green new deal through our market based economy the green new deal should be celebrated for putting a much needed spotlight on the urgency of the climate challenge the question however is how best to give meaning to its ambition the proper measure of climate ambition is not large scale public works programs or government spending akin to the original new deal such an approach is not only unlikely to be politically feasible but it is also unlikely to be sufficient to address the climate challenge to be sure more government investment is needed in mass transit clean energy r d boosting deployment of emerging technologies and more but private businesses fund more than 60 percent and perform more than 70 percent of total r d in the united states with industry responsible for even larger portions of applied research and product development and the public funds available for clean energy investments even ignoring the severe constraints of political feasibility still pale in comparison to the tens of trillions of dollars in private sector capital that can be deployed that s why for example jim kim feels he can continue to pursue the work he did at the world bank from his new role at the world s largest infrastructure private equity firm he abruptly resigned from the former in january our energy sources and system result not primarily from government actions but from vast numbers of individual and firm economic decisions where to live what kind of car to buy what kind of car to produce what kind of factory to build how efficient to make one s home or business and on and on the government does not make steel or cement nor produce the energy we use to do so with a few exceptions government has a very important role to play in the design of our energy system from regulating utility rates to generating electricity through power marketing administrations and the rural utilities service to leasing federal lands for development to name just a few but for the most part private incentives and investments determine the energy system that we have this market based system allows for the dynamism innovation and entrepreneurship that is the hallmark of america s economy governments cannot anticipate today what the best and most cost effective system will be to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions even as population and economic growth rise the energy system of the future may consist of a mix of solar wind batteries biofuels hydrogen advanced nuclear carbon capture negative emission technologies smart grids and a range of other existing technologies along with new ones that may be unknown today moreover policy approaches that presume to know what the optimal system looks like may suffer unintended consequences president dwight d eisenhower s interstate highway program itself intended to be a public works program on a massive scale according to eisenhower biographer stephen ambrose gave rise to the suburban sprawl and urban decline that policymakers grapple with today robert moses s master plan for new york city entrenched the car as the primary means of transportation a yoke the city is still trying get out from under today the bureau of reclamation s massive water projects a direct result of the new deal s push for massive public works projects left a legacy of environmental degradation and unsustainable agricultural practices in the american west that trace directly to the water crisis in western states today the new deal delivered not only massive public works programs but also regulatory innovations like the federal power commission since replaced by the federal energy regulatory commission the regulatory state that has since developed provides a set of tools on which new policies can build to enable government to better guide what adam smith famously called the invisible hand toward our shared policy objectives an ambitious policy agenda to implement the green new deal should embrace the power of market forces while recognizing that our market based system must be coupled with a robust and energetic role for government if it is to work effectively avoid abuse and provide public goods like defense those government policies then must be aimed at addressing market failures and achieving our shared social goals like reducing carbon pollution as well as remedying past policy interventions that may have disadvantaged clean energy sources alexander hamilton helped give birth to our modern economy but he also recognized the need for an energetic federal government role he famously wrote in matters of industry human enterprise ought doubtless to be left free in the main not fettered by too much regulation but practical politicians know that it may be beneficially stimulated by prudent aids and encouragements on the part of government his legacy is often erroneously embraced by those who favor more heavy handed federal industrial policy but hamilton was clear that the extraordinary aid and protection of government he favored should be temporary and was appropriate for a nation in an early stage of development not for all countries at all times wherever possible hamilton preferred financial incentives to government directives writes his biographer ron chernow drawing from hamilton s insights a green new deal for today s economic system must combine the wisdom of our market based system with a better appreciation for the fact that the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of letting market forces alone determine outcomes whether for social equity or for carbon emissions a course correction is needed implementing a green new deal the six key elements so what does that mean for designing climate policy today the green new deal is a set of ambitions that include net zero greenhouse gas emissions a fair and just transition for workers as well as millions of good high wage jobs and high quality health care affordable safe and adequate housing and economic security for all americans giving meaning to these lofty goals requires concrete and cost effective policies that leverage rather than reject the strengths of our economic system and reality of energy system climate policies should be designed cognizant of social equity priorities but are still distinct from an economic justice agenda aimed at inequality health care housing and employment generous new government programs for example may be warranted to achieve the goal of expanding access to affordable housing but energy focused policies are needed to affect the choices individuals and firms make about what materials to use in building them what fuels are used to make the needed steel and concrete how efficient to make the buildings and where the electricity to power and heat to warm them comes from government policy surely shapes those individual economic choices from subsidies for oil and gas or agriculture to federal infrastructure investments to zoning laws but that s the point a green new deal policy framework must recognize that our energy system reflects collective individual and firm decisions and economic incentives rather than government planning and robust government policy must then ensure those economic incentives are aligned with our broader public policy goals in practice a green new deal should therefore comprise a collection of ambitious policies that focus relentlessly on what makes the biggest dent in greenhouse gas emissions and avoid wasting precious political capital on symbolic or virtue signaling actions it should also focus on cost effectiveness not only because resources are limited but because lessons from other countries teach us that maintaining public support for robust climate mitigation measures requires minimizing costs to consumers and the economy a green new deal policy package along these lines would focus on six priorities first policies must transition the united states to a low carbon energy system the key policy instrument here is a price on carbon to change investment incentives and production and consumption patterns putting a price on carbon can be achieved through different policy instruments such as a carbon tax or a cap and trade system a carbon price would require producers and consumers of energy to internalize the cost to society from climate change damages that result from their energy choices a carbon price has many virtues a carbon price encourages emissions reductions wherever and however they can be achieved most cost effectively without needing to know beforehand what the cheapest solutions will be which is important because the future development and costs of energy technologies cannot be projected with any degree of precision a carbon price also does not require knowing today what sectors of the economy will deliver the lowest cost emission reductions this is particularly important given the tendency in policy to focus on the most visible parts of the energy system leading to an excessive focus on cars and the power sector for example which together produce less than half of u s emissions the power of a well designed carbon price is that it has a way of reaching into the nooks and crannies of our economic and energy system to achieve reductions that we might not have realized were possible because it gives everyone an incentive to make different choices about how to invest consume and produce research by the center on global energy policy at columbia university finds that a 50 per ton carbon tax that grows over time would reduce emissions in 2030 by between 39 and 46 percent below 2005 levels and do so at negligible economic cost indeed the impacts on the economy may be positive or negative depending on how the revenue is used and in no scenario do they exceed 0 5 percent of gdp per year the costs of climate change impacts due to inaction will be far greater a carbon tax will raise energy prices for households including low income households that can least afford it and that spend a disproportionate share of their income on energy concerns about equity highlighted in the green new deal combined with concerns about the political viability of the agenda argue strongly for the revenue being used to offset the adverse effects of a carbon tax through equal lump sum rebates to consumers as recently recommended by a large group of the nation s leading economists performance standards may also be used such as requirements for certain levels of efficiency or clean energy in vehicles buildings or appliances these may be justified by various behavioral biases that diminish the impact of a carbon price alone such as consumer misperceptions of fuel savings when purchasing new vehicles political economy factors that may keep carbon prices below their socially optimal level or other market failures such as principal agent problems that limit a carbon price s effectiveness because for example a building owner whose renters pay the utility bills will not have an incentive to invest in more efficient appliances or insulation other supporting policies can also remove barriers to implementing the above policies such as utility regulation reform to promote grid flexibility competition and digital technology adoption second policy should focus on removing co2 from the atmosphere through natural and technological means there is almost no plausible scenario at this point for limiting temperature increase to 2 degrees celsius let alone 1 5 degrees that does not include large scale sequestration of co2 and also natural and technological tools to achieve negative emissions by removing co2 from the atmosphere the mid century strategy for deep decarbonization prepared by the obama administration estimates that land sector and co2 removal technologies could sequester 30 to 50 percent of economy wide ghg emissions by 2050 creating carbon based incentives in the land sector would induce landowners and farmers to avoid deforestation and pursue reforestation or to change agricultural practices on croplands and grazing lands ideally such incentives would be integrated into an economy wide carbon price although in practice the scale and complexity of the land sector makes that challenging as an alternative other incentive structures can be created that mirror the carbon price to ensure land carbon sequestration opportunities are pursued to achieve overall carbon goals as efficiently as possible carefully coupling such programs with mechanisms to accurately monitor and measure land based emission reductions is a key policy challenge the federal government should also change its own management practices on federal lands which comprise 20 percent of the annual u s carbon sink this would include incorporating carbon sequestration and emission estimates into land management plans and environmental reviews and prioritizing forest restoration and resilience in addition to the land carbon sink a carbon pricing regime should also include credit for negative emissions achieved through technological means bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration is the most mature form of negative emission technology direct air capture machines can also remove co2 from the air such as the ones being used today at a waste incinerating plant in switzerland and geothermal field in iceland such technology currently costs about 600 per ton of co2 abated although estimates suggest the costs can decline to around 100 or 200 by as early as 2025 third policy must reduce the emissions of non co2 greenhouse gas emissions one fifth of u s greenhouse gas emissions come from gases other than co2 such as methane nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs these are highly potent at trapping heat and have more near term impact because they are short lived in the atmosphere around one third of methane emissions come from the oil and gas industry which has taken steps to reduce methane leaks and committed to go further through bodies like the oil and gas climate initiative government regulation should limit methane emissions to ensure that such measures are taken by all firms and continue to drive further reductions and industry should advocate for sound methane reduction policies as well as called for in the methane guiding principles signed by many leading oil and gas companies in the face of potential rollbacks a few companies have publicly called for the epa to continue to regulate methane most recently shell exxonmobil and bp at a major industry conference this year more should follow suit to preserve a level playing field and support reductions industry wide as discussed above improved agricultural practices can reduce not only co2 but also non co2 gases notably methane and nitrous oxide roughly 40 percent of which come from agricultural production climate policy should invest in r d deploy educational tools and create economic incentives to reduce non co2 gases in agriculture as well as develop protocols for measuring and verifying reductions in the agricultural sector hydrofluorocarbons hfcs are another potent greenhouse that can be reduced through regulation the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol an international agreement of nearly 200 countries to phase out the use of hfcs that has broad industry support would avoid up to 0 5 degrees celsius of warming but has languished as the trump administration has refused to submit it to the senate for ratification fourth the federal government should sharply increase spending on research and development r d of clean energy technologies as well as invest in low carbon energy infrastructure and mass transit economists have long recognized that private firms underinvest in r d relative to the social value of those investments because they cannot capture the full benefits of their innovations furthermore research demonstrates that federal r d spending generates substantial positive returns and induces more private sector r d rather than displacing it numerous government and industry leaders have called for federal energy r d spending two to three times as high as today s levels numerous government and industry leaders have called for federal energy r d spending two to three times as high as today s levels while the returns are particularly high for early stage and basic research funding federal funding may also extend to demonstration and deployment rdd d given the high costs long term nature and risks associated with energy technologies improved risk management accountability and risk based cost sharing practices should accompany such a funding expansion the department of energy loan program office can be better leveraged for investments in technology and infrastructure and attract private investment by lowering the risk profile fifth u s climate policy should prioritize international cooperation and spurring action by other countries climate change is the ultimate collective action problem since a ton of co2 contributes equally to the problem regardless of where it is emitted thus it makes sense for the united states to incur the cost of decarbonization only if other nations follow suit the paris climate agreement was designed with precisely this sort of mechanism in mind allowing nations to reduce emissions and then reassess every five years whether other nations were doing so as well so that they could collectively ratchet up their ambitions the united states must reengage in the international climate negotiation process to lead these efforts additionally u s domestic policy can be designed to encourage other nations to take stronger actions for example by including a border adjustment in a carbon price that takes the carbon content of imported goods unless other nations adopt climate policy of similar stringency to our own finally much more robust policies are needed to help workers who suffer dislocation from a clean energy transition this imperative extends far beyond the 60 000 americans who still work in the coal sector and the green new deal should be celebrated for placing issues of a just transition squarely in the center of the climate change debate rather than as an afterthought transition assistance is important as a matter of equity justice and good economic policy rather than make false promises to bring back the jobs of coal workers for example which the trump administration has failed to do despite its bluster policymakers must take more seriously the need to help workers who have powered the u s economy for generations but whose jobs are likely to decline through no fault of their own moreover taking issues of just transition seriously is good politics as the gilets jaunes protests in paris remind those workers who risk being left behind by a clean energy transition even if small in number pose a powerful political obstacle to stronger climate policies unless they have a sense of confidence there will be new opportunities for them in the future the policy prescriptions to facilitate necessary transitions extend to a broader set of economic policy measures targeted at workers far beyond just the energy sector they are also very difficult to design and implement despite promises from the federal government for a quarter century to provide worker retraining education and other support to help communities displaced by globalization and displacement both parties have failed to fulfill those promises nonetheless a range of community driven economic diversification efforts have shown promise the federal government can support those efforts through infrastructure investments tax credits and repurposing of old energy sites like abandoned mine land for other economic uses as well as fulfilling pension obligations to name just a few policy options all the climate policy interventions described above must also be designed with a much greater prioritization of environmental justice concerns than has been true in the past one of the greatest failures of environmental policy of the past half century has been that when robust action is taken to make progress reducing air or water pollution those environmental benefits are not equitably shared low income and minority populations have often ended up bearing the disproportionate share of the cost even when the country is moving more broadly in the right direction on environmental challenges public investments made as part of our transition to a lower carbon future from transportation to smart homes and buildings to urban planning should increasingly prioritize equity considerations at the same time the best policy framework to solve the urgent problem of climate change is not the same as the set of policies that are needed to address the other very important social and economic priorities identified in the green new deal good policy design uses the policy instrument most targeted at the problem being addressed conflating policy objectives risks undermining the efficacy of any particular policy intervention and delaying action government s key role in solving climate change isn t spending while the ambition of the green new deal has been framed by some as a world war ii style economic mobilization the robust policy agenda outlined above would lead to dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions without massive government programs or spending more government spending is certainly needed and important but it s not the key metric of success to support this agenda is not to sacrifice ambition toward decarbonization nor to let the possible and pragmatic dictate policy while neglecting what climate science makes clear needs to be done on the contrary this policy agenda recognizes that the private sector capital available to be tapped for energy sector investments dwarfs even the most ambitious proposals for what government might spend it recognizes both the reality and wisdom of our market based economic system to deliver the innovation that will be required to solve the climate challenge albeit operating under much stronger rules and incentives created by government to achieve that goal it recognizes that achieving a goal as audacious as decarbonizing the u s economy will be met at a much lower cost by embracing the dynamism of our market based structure the 90 billion in clean energy investments made as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 holds some lessons for design of a green new deal policy framework these investments catalyzed rapid growth in renewable energy and demonstrate the value smart government investments can have at the same time some of the spending revealed the challenges of designing government programs and risks of unintended consequences academic research has shown that the subsidies to weatherize homes delivered only one third of their projected energy savings similarly incentives to buy more efficient appliances largely subsidized purchases people would have made anyway or caused them just to shift the time in which they made the purchase to get the rebate the same was true for a program outside the recovery act to subsidize the purchase of more fuel efficient cars and scrap less efficient ones moreover even the successful renewables subsidies did not have the same impact that changes in the price of natural gas did to transition our electricity sector away from coal demonstrating the power of price signals that affect the incentives faced by every economic actor in our society rather than leave such price signals to the market a green new deal policy framework should create them to deliver the low carbon energy system we need a half century ago extreme smog cloaked los angeles and acid rain despoiled american lakes streams and forests solving these problems required not government economic mobilization but laws and regulations that limited pollution forcing new practices consumption patterns and technologies subsequent policy innovation further revealed that the embrace of market based regulatory tools such as the cap and trade program pioneered to tackle acid rain and incentives for technological innovation could deliver environmental benefits at much lower costs than command and control regulations to be sure the scale and complexity of climate change is far greater but the ubiquity of greenhouse gas emissions is even more reason why the policy response should create incentives and restrictions that change consumer and producer behaviors and induce new technological developments in the widest range of sectors conclusion the great british economist alfred marshall once spoke of the need for cool heads but warm hearts when making policy a warm heart requires us to acknowledge that our market based economy today is failing many americans and that a course correction is badly needed to deliver outcomes that live up to america s promise of equal opportunity justice and inclusive growth among the most urgent market failures is the climate change crisis which demands far more robust and urgent government policy to address it a cool head requires us to rigorously analyze what government policy interventions in the market will make the greatest dent in greenhouse gas emissions and do so at the lowest costs possible as outlined above policy that can meaningfully reduce emissions includes limiting or pricing pollution setting performance standards encouraging or requiring greater efficiency changing incentives for how we produce and consume energy and creating incentives for and investing in development of new technologies energy policy also must pay far greater attention to ensuring a just transition for workers dislocated by climate action and issues of environmental justice as the green new deal admirably highlights more government investments are certainly needed but are by no means sufficient federal spending is not the primary measure of ambition nor is it required at the scale of world war ii style economic mobilization if it is to solve the climate crisis as some have characterized the green new deal our market based economy delivers dynamism growth and innovation and a more energetic role for government can ensure it delivers sustainability fairness and equity too the immediacy of the climate challenge means there s no time to lose getting on with that urgent task
part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 part 5 two months after workers launched wildcat strikes in the mexican city of matamoros 89 maquiladora factories mostly in the auto parts electric and metallurgical industries have agreed to workers demands for a 20 percent raise and a bonus of 32 000 pesos us 1 655 half of the average yearly salary the strike wave has become known across mexico as the 20 32 movement the mexican and us ruling classes have sought to claw back concessions and contain and isolate the rebellion by laying off 4 700 workers to date the ruling class has also threatened to fire 50 000 of the 85 000 maquiladora workers in the city and is desperately propping up the trade union apparatus to block further struggles it is accelerating its attacks against democratic rights and is turning toward authoritarian and militaristic forms of rule on march 1 a matamoros worker shared a world socialist web site article online regarding the crippling effects strikes are having on the north american auto industry and the growing support for mexican workers across the continent the worker posted wow finally i read something coherent about workers and their movement as it began to circulate widely on facebook 52 year old labor lawyer susana prieto terrazas intervened to denounce the wsws but this outlet also publishes stupidities she wrote they are also part of my detractors the left that sells the idea that workers can organize by themselves naturally and without help they are pathetic what she calls pathetic workers independent initiative of self organization is precisely the source of the workers power workers in matamoros took the historic and crucial step of forming rank and file committees to by pass the trade unions so that they could communicate democratically appeal not to the mexican government but to workers across the city and internationally and organize the largest strike across north america in at least three decades consolidating these gains and taking the struggle forward under an internationalist and socialist program is the only way forward against mass reprisals for all prieto s left talk the truth is that she is a longtime partner of the us trade union federation the afl cio which makes mexican company unions or charrismo look almost like militants a self proclaimed capitalist prieto arrived at matamoros dishonestly denying her ties to any unions and to the ruling bourgeois party movement for national regeneration morena in order to politically disarm workers and find the best way to shut the strike down she offered the legal advice that workers had to remain tied to the union apparatus and place their trust in mexican president andr√©s manuel l√≥pez obrador known as amlo to win their demands she convinced workers to send delegations on march 5 to monterrey le√≥n and on march 13 15 to mexico city to discuss joining independent unions bound to the morena government and us and european imperialism tellingly the wall street journal which has historically elevated the most right wing forces featured prieto in its march 14 edition the newspaper sent a photographer to matamoros to portray prieto as a marvel superhero character while rejoicing her efforts have made her a folk hero in matamoros workers have given her cakes flowers and t shirts with her name on it and the legend god sent an angel to matamoros to help the working class some have composed ballads in her honor yet the tribute to prieto by the top media outlet of the american financial aristocracy also exposes another lie the paper indicated that she makes her income as a lawyer for independent unions it is critical to refute prieto s slanders against the wsws because they lie at the center of this political fraud against the working class which must now draw the lessons from the strike and render accounts of the roles played by its protagonists this requires a sober examination of how this strategic experience unfolded within its historical and international context what produced the wildcat strikes and why in matamoros during the 1980s new shipping and information technologies set the stage for the globalization of capitalist production one of its effects was to render unviable the isolated soviet economy fast tracking the dissolution of the first workers state the ussr at the hands of the stalinist bureaucracy the closer integration of production globally and the demise of the ussr only deepened the crisis of the capitalist system japanese and european imperialism had partially recovered since world war ii to become again contending rivals of us imperialism renewed global competition for sources of cheap labor markets and natural resources intensified by the computerization of trade and financial capital was accompanied by the formation of rival trade blocs a 1992 study by the autonomous university of mexico unam on the negotiations of the north american free trade agreement noted the european common market and the potential entailed by a supposed european self sufficiency calls for the integration of regional markets with the magnitude of the so called north american common market the development of this economic stronghold for us and canadian imperialism rested on the exploitation of the mexican maquiladoras as a cheap labor platform however the report warned if the cost of manual labor increases and mexico ceases to enjoy a competitive world wide edge the tendency will be towards the disappearance of the maquiladora industry as such in mexico industrial centers sprung up across the us mexico border and in the baj√≠o region in north central mexico raising the workforce at maquiladora sweatshops from 400 000 to 3 million today with millions more employed in related activities despite the ballooning demand for mexican labor living standards fell a study by the economics faculty in unam titled mexico 2018 another social and political defeat for the working class found that the real purchasing power of mexicans has fallen 80 percent in the last 30 years indicating that more than 24 hours of work today are necessary to afford the staples one bought in 1987 with roughly five hours of work today industrial salaries in mexico are 50 percent of industrial salaries in china the relation was the opposite two decades ago reported the bank hsbc last year seeing their wealth and power increase with the inflow of foreign capital the mexican bourgeoisie and trade unions forged tighter relations with us imperialism and readily enforced the falling compensation for mexican workers labor to meet the globalized profit requirements of the financial elite in matamoros strikes during the 1980s had won maquiladora workers unique conditions in the region like a 40 hour week paid at 56 hours in 1983 along with a relatively more militant tradition facing such pressure from below agapito gonz√°lez cavazos after four decades leading the union of laborers and industrial workers of the maquiladora industry sjoiim was one of the few trade union leaders still calling strikes to resist the downward pressures of the approaching nafta agreement on january 31 1992 however during negotiations with 42 companies including general motors gonz√°lez was detained for several weeks by federal authorities on charges of fiscal fraud under gonz√°lez the union had consolidated its significant wealth financial obscurity prominence in the ctm and ruling circles and its corporatist role as a labor contractor subordinated to management the arrest was for gonz√°lez the sign that it was impossible to continue juggling any defense of workers interests and the union bureaucracy s comfortable social standing which rested on the defense of capitalist relations and their nationalist framework along with every trade union in the world the sjoiim responded to the new context under globalization by dropping any serious resistance until gonzalez s death in 2001 and thereafter the 48 hour week was re imposed and according to a recent article by somosmass99 the starting salary being negotiated in 1992 by the sjoiim was the equivalent of 19 50 per day compared to the current 10 86 including the recent 20 percent raise by the end of 2018 the percentage of the working population with an income below the basket of staple foods which the government defines as extreme poverty was 40 percent meanwhile the top 10 percent has hoarded 67 percent of the country s wealth and more than 80 percent of financial assets the number of dollar millionaires increased 27 percent to 88 000 just in 2017 when officials reported that 57 percent of the working population had no access to social security benefits including health care the pressure to transfer ever greater amounts of money into the financial markets only intensified after the 2008 crash at a time when china became a new economic competitor on the world stage facing a continued decline of its relative economic power us imperialism has been compelled to consolidate its own economic political and military sphere of control in preparation for economic and military confrontations against its global rivals these strategic considerations were behind trump s renegotiation of nafta which includes several concessions from the mexican and canadian bourgeoisies in favor of us capital including a ban on forging a free trade agreement with china fundamentally trump s protectionism relies on further downward pressures on wages and conditions to incentivize the reshuffling of production from china europe and asia back to north america and on a lesser degree to the rest of us imperialism s backyard latin america the us commerce department recently listed imports for us auto manufacturers and presumably other key industries as a national security concern the new nafta requires that 75 percent of components of cars and trucks be manufactured within north america an increase from 62 5 percent already 45 percent of auto parts imported into the us come from mexico while 40 percent of mexican made vehicles exported to the us consist of auto parts made in the us the us and mexico auto industries are like siamese twins inseparable and highly intertwined writes the industry magazine mexico now eighty percent of mexican exports mostly industrial products made in maquiladora plants go to the us cheap labor tax cuts land and other incentives for investments in the mexican maquiladora industry lie at the heart of us capitalism s strategy for trade war and military confrontation with its global rivals representing the interests of rent seekers or junior partners to us and foreign capital within the mexican ruling elite and upper middle class including factions of the trade union bureaucracy the amlo administration came up with a scheme to further cheapen labor and cut taxes to attract us investments particularly after the trump administration had brought down the corporate tax rate from 34 to 21 percent at the same time the overwhelming majorities won by morena during the july 2018 presidential and parliamentary elections reflected profound popular aspirations that this party touted as left would implement policies to massively improve social conditions for the toiling masses these considerations led to a signature campaign promise of amlo turning the 18 mile wide strip along the 2000 mile border with the us into a free trade zone the plan which took effect january 1 cut the value added tax from 16 to 8 percent and the income taxes from 30 to 20 percent in the new free trade zone it also raised the minimum wage 16 percent nationally to a meager 102 daily pesos 5 and 100 percent within the free trade zone to 176 daily pesos 9 15 the majority of workers along the border already earned slightly more than 176 pesos in matamoros only 20 percent earned less according to the maquiladora association index the crux of amlo s free trade zone was that companies would be free to eliminate bonuses to compensate for the new minimum wage even if workers were not benefitted by the raise while amlo and morena were taking workers for fools as early as november 13 there were reports of workers at border cities denouncing the elimination of their bonuses in matamoros the situation was even more explosive an old provision in the sjoiim contract stipulated that salaries across the board must increase proportionately to any minimum wage hike to protect purchasing power and that bonuses had to compensate workers for this change throughout december the union leader juan villafuerte morales and the union delegates from the 48 plants a majority of which are owned by us based companies held backroom talks with the local government under the new morena mayor mario l√≥pez nicknamed la borrega or the sheep during these negotiations mayor l√≥pez told reporters from central tv that the wage increase was not financially viable for the maquiladoras so he was intervening in a chat between the union and the companies instead of paying the 100 percent wage increase and the corresponding bonus of 32 000 pesos it turned out that the plan of the sjoiim morena and index was to silently overlook the raise and bonus even the standard annual bonus of 3 000 pesos on december 28 a short wildcat strike of hundreds of workers at the maquiladora of seisa medical in ciudad ju√°rez against the halving of their bonus was a shot across the bow with a social explosion brewing susana prieto returned from a vacation in patagonia and as early as january 5 intervened with a video message to amlo claiming she was receiving complaints from workers in the border region and channeling this opposition behind an appeal to the new government to ban the sweeping cuts to bonuses prieto whose office is in ciudad ju√°rez and who resides across the border in el paso texas gained local prominence in 2015 2016 while representing 56 workers fired from a lexmark maquiladora for protesting for a switch to an independent union to fight for better conditions in 2016 protests against the unions poverty wages and sweatshop conditions soon grew into mass marches of thousands of workers from eaton lear foxconn lexmark and other plants prieto quickly founded an advocacy organization named obrer s maquiler s de ciudad juarez a c while claiming a leading role it served to prevent wildcat strikes isolate workers in ciudad ju√°rez and channel them into a dead end formal complaints to the corrupt labor conciliation and arbitration board loans unsuccessful demands to switch to one of the self proclaimed independent unions and an unsuccessful non party bid for mayor by one of the workers antonia hinojosa hern√°ndez her organization and representation of the 56 workers was openly backed in march 2016 by the main trade union federation in the united states the afl cio along with the mexican new workers central nct industriall and several other local and international organizations a letter from the afl cio called on lexmark to recognize publicly the rights of workers to form an independent union and was signed by the director of the us federation s international department catherine feingold who rose up the ranks of the federation s cia sponsored solidarity center prieto continued to develop her relations with the afl cio in december 2017 she was a keynote speaker along with several afl cio officials at a binational conference to cancel nafta in carson california the event was co sponsored by the afl cio and the mexican electrician s union sme according to mexico webcast prieto attended another binational conference in tuxtla guti√©rrez chiapas in march 2018 in which an agreement was reached between several mexican and us unions to make the struggles across the border visible prieto s obrer s maquiler s de ciudad juarez a c then organized a march across the border on april 24 26 with the alliance of national state and municipal organizations of the movement of san quint√≠n workers itself co founded by the afl cio during a similar rank and file rebellion against the existing union in 2015 by agricultural workers in baja california the most important victory according to an alliance statement was the founding of the independent national and democratic union of workers of san quint√≠n sindja which immediately affiliated to the national workers union unt the march co organized by prieto would culminate in another binational conference in ciudad ju√°rez on april 27 28 2018 within mexico prieto s obrer s maquiler s de ciudad juarez a c publicly backed the candidacy of amlo according to reports on el paso inc august 20 2018 prieto was also behind an effort to organize a march in downtown ju√°rez in support of morena mayoral candidate javier gonz√°lez mocken who had publicly asked the local index to join me in constituting part of the municipal government then on january 7 2019 prieto announced the beginning of the fight in defense of salaries in this country in a video in which she expressed concerns

briefing highlights bmo sees no big short stocks loonie oil at a glance what to watch for on brexit what else to watch for this week brookfield invests in transalta newmont unveils special dividend apple jumps into video streaming from today s globe and mail no big short things could always get far worse for canada s economy but even then it wouldn t be our version of the big short the bank of montreal says could the soft patch evolve into a more significant downturn said bmo senior economist robert kavcic it s not our forecast but it absolutely could he added in a report residential investment had risen to a record high share of gdp early last year before starting to retrench and housing has large tentacles that spread widely across the economy but would it be a major financial stability event like the u s in 2009 highly unlikely mr kavcic was responding to comments last week from steve eisman a neuberger berman portfolio manager and figure in the book the big short who is shorting canadian banks though he didn t say which ones i m calling for a simple normalization of credit that hasn t happened in 20 years he told the financial times bmo wasn t disagreeing with parts of this just the opposite in fact we ve heard these bearish calls for much of the past decade and they ve continually been exaggerated mr kavcic said while this latest rendition has grabbed a lot of attention on the street mainstream feature film etc it actually isn t that over the top calling for slower economic growth and normalizing credit conditions he added we d actually agree on both counts canada s economy stagnated in the fourth quarter as consumers cut back the housing market slowed and business investment lagged the pace of consumer borrowing has also slowed markedly but that s what policy makers wanted to happen as they brought in mortgage qualification stress tests at the federal level in early 2018 and measures to cool housing markets at the b c and ontario levels economists aren t holding out much hope for the current quarter though the economy is forecast to pick up after that we ll learn more friday when statistics canada reports on how the economy fared in january analysts expect to see that economic growth was flat or possibly contracted by up to 0 2 per cent as the alberta government s forced energy production cuts took effect that said bmo s benjamin reitzes canadian rates and macro strategist would have trimmed growth by 0 3 to 0 4 of a percentage point and remember that s going to be temporary as the oil cutbacks ease a flat monthly gdp reading isn t usually a cause for celebration but this time is different said cibc world markets senior economist royce mendes who expects statistics canada to report no growth a material drag from oil production as a result of mandated cuts in alberta is expected to show up in january he added so if the economy was able to avoid a negative reading it will indeed be a positive sign back to the big short bmo s mr kavcic noted that canada has been making making mortgage lending rules stricter for 10 years something the u s didn t do in the runup to the crisis and so while canadian debt levels swelled the pace of lending never reached that of the pre crisis era credit delinquencies he added have also been low all that said if the downturn deepens housing levered equities could fall and home prices

many of us were surprised to hear that our county s estimated inflation rate is expected to be as low as around 4 80 per cent the authorities defended their calculation but given the increased prices in various products and services that low estimated inflation rate still seems remarkable however i was not surprised at the recent polls showing that most people are not enjoying incomes commensurate with the improvement in our country s economic health often we see many prices either creeping up insidiously and some escalate in leaps and bounds the infamous weekly gas and diesel prices may fall by a few measly cents but tend to rise by dollars the following week the sneakiest but most persistent price increases take place in the supermarkets we all need to eat so although we might try to shop around we all buy most of our food i understand that merchants price their goods by estimating the foreign exchange rate months in advance it s speculative and therefore goods are priced based on their replacement value and those prices never go down that makes the prices of many goods increase over a fairly short time our economy is heavily dependent on the united states dollar there are several major drains on the system the hotels house our invaluable guests but a significant portion of those earnings is not returned or re invested in jamaica the major hotels are either foreign owned or have major foreign investment they must pay their foreign investors and that leaves relatively little to put back in the country from which cumulative billions of dollars are earned our banks perform similarly they accept our savings but charge us a fee for doing so they use our money to lend to others and make a healthy profit they charge us when we withdraw our savings and charge us if we do nothing with the account even though they are always profiting from it then the banks also send money abroad to their owners and investors headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters we need transport but the auto industry significantly depletes our foreign exchange by spending millions of united states dollars annually the vehicles and parts that they import are not usually for production or for earning needed foreign exchange so there is no getting back what they consume it s a one way thing we are consumers who produce relatively little all these factors make for increases in the rate of inflation it s therefore difficult to explain such a low rate of inflation when there is so little production excessive spending consumption and a weak jamaican dollar i suggest that the reason for our lower than expected rate of inflation is what i call the s subsidy factor modelled off the national water commission s k and x factors explaining the modifications to their bills most jamaicans both blue and white collar workers are subsidising the economy because they are either charging or receiving salaries that are well below what they are worth this goes for paye earners skilled and unskilled labourers business people entrepreneurs and even professionals every profession occupation is different so i can only speak for doctors the vast majority of physicians are charging fees that are way below the services that they offer if everyone were to demand the type of salary commensurate with their service job the rate of inflation would skyrocket if the baseline for salaries were a living wage instead of a minimum wage the middle class workforce would need better payment packages the self employed would increase their fees prices and all this would increase the rate of inflation in other words most citizens in all spheres of life have been holding strain this wide disparity in salaries earnings contribute to despair migration corruption and crime garth a rattray is a medical doctor with a family practice email feedback to columns gleanerjm com and garthrattray gmail com

the canadian dollar came under renewed selling pressure on friday and it didn t abate in asia or europe overnight friday s pressure stemmed from weaker than expected canadian retail sales data which showed a drop of 0 3 in january rather than the 0 4 increase which was forecast even worse december s result was revised lower fortunately a modestly higher inflation reading helped ease the pain from the retail sales data but not enough to prevent another slide in the currency the canadian dollar was also a victim of broad risk aversion sentiment markets were focused on news that the 3 month u s treasury yield fell below the 10 year treasury yield a which some analysts regard as a signal of an imminent u s recession the u s dollar surged against the major g 10 currencies undermining the canadian dollar in the process other analysts are not convinced that this yield curve inversion is an accurate indicator of a recession economists at royal bank of canada point out that a lot of u s treasuries are owned by foreigners suggesting the inversion may be a better indicator of the global economy not necessarily that of america reuters quoted former fed chair janet yellen saying the u s treasury yield curve may signal the need to cut interest rates at some point but it does not signal a recession asia equity markets were hammered led by a 3 01 plunge in japan s nikkei 225 index which followed in the footsteps of a 1 77 drop in the dow jones industrial average on friday european bourses are in negative territory and u s equity futures point to a lower open on wall street today the canadian dollar was undermined by a plunge in west texas intermediate oil prices on friday which dropped from 60 05 u s barrel to 58 30 u s b the climbed to 59 13 u s overnight but have slipped down to 58 77 u s b in early toronto trading the oil price drop added to the negative canadian dollar sentiment the federal budget tabled last tuesday was another cause for concern for canadian dollar traders the government s decision to increase deficit spending led to fitch ratings speculating on the validity of canada s aaa bond rating fitch wrote canada s gross general government debt combining federal and provincial fiscal accounts is higher than other aaa rated sovereigns excepting the u s and remains close to a level that is incompatible with aaa status they went on to say while the budget is broadly in line with earlier trends the preference for continued deficits and increased program spending over fiscal consolidation could increase the vulnerability of public finances to a faster economic slowdown or sudden shock there aren t any notable canadian economic reports available today while the u s data is second tier suggesting equity markets will drive currency direction rahim madhavji is the president of knightsbridgefx com a canadian currency exchange that provides better rates than the banks to canadians

naturally equities aren t showing it that much but the unfolding dynamic in bond markets which has recently seen global yields tumble to multi year lows is still in motion the momentum behind this move diminished slightly last night leading some to call for a bit of a snap back in the very short term however the trend is firmly in place yields are falling the world over as traders position themselves for the combined effects of a deterioration in economic activity and subsequent interest rate cuts from the world s biggest central banks 5 australian bonds rally such an appetite for relatively safe bonds manifested in our own markets too there was a sale of 5 year agbs and the demand for the asset conveyed market participants desire for capital preservation the bid to cover ratio out of the auction was a significant 5 61 aussie bonds have in a world where government debt is outperforming short term seen some of the greatest in flows of late catching up with risk off sentiment that had plagued markets yields on agbs tumbled during yesterday s trade most noteworthy was the activity in the 10 year security it s yield fell nearly 8 seven basis points to a record low 1 77 per cent 6 australian dollar resilience and a little luck despite the fall in yields on australian dollar denominated bonds at least in the last 24 hours the australian dollar has made its way modestly higher the little battler as its affectionately known has lived up to its reputation recently managing to hold itself above the 0 7000 handle even in light of the mounting risk to global economic activity the primary reasoning behind this has been twofold first the yield spread between us treasuries and agbs has actually narrowed as traders price in a us economy increasingly inhibited by the slowdown in global economic growth second the perhaps fortuitous lift in iron ore prices courtesy of persistent fears about production and supply of that commodity 7 defensive sectors loom as potential leaders it s unlikely that plain luck will keep the asx200 sustained a settling of fundamentals is required for that to be achieved that s problematic too given the dearth of information the world over the asx will be reaching for global leads to add to its recent gains just for today spi futures are indicating that the asx200 will open about 8 points higher as wall street stages a quick dash higher into its close the bulls will be hoping for a bounce today but judging by us markets lead it s a bit tough to see where that may come from a defensive rotation was at play in the s p500 so chances are a play into yield stocks will be the theme today 8 market watch spi futures down 3 points or 0 05 to 6105 at 4 50am aedt aud 0 4 to 0 71 us cents on wall st at 12 25pm in new york dow 0 2 s p 500 0 02 nasdaq 0 03 in new york at 12 06pm bhp 1 3 rio 2 3 atlassian 0 03 in europe stoxx 0 2 50 ftse 0 4 cac 0 2 dax 0 3 spot gold 0 6 to us1322 14 an ounce brent crude 0 4 to us67 81 a barrel us oil 0 1 to us 59 10 a barrel iron ore 0 2 to us85 81 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 3 to 616 yuan lme aluminium 1 1 to us1883 a tonne lme copper 0 5 to us6 340 a tonne 2 year yield us 2 26 australia 1 46 5 year yield us 2 19 australia 1 45 10 year yield us 2 42 australia 1 78 germany 0 03 us australia 10 year yield gap 58 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
everything is in place for a new international financial crisis to occur we don t know exactly when it will break out but it will and its impact will be felt all over the planet the major factors contributing to the crisis situation are first the very large increase in corporate private debt and then the growing speculative bubble speculative bubble an economic financial or speculative bubble is formed when the level of trading prices on a market financial assets market currency exchange market property market raw materials market etc settles well above the intrinsic or fundamental financial value of the goods or assets being exchanged in such a situation prices diverge from the usual economic valuation under the influence of buyers beliefs involving financial instruments financial instruments financial instruments include financial securities and financial contracts securities in stock exchanges debt securities securities market and in certain countries including the usa and china the real estate sector again the two factors are closely interconnected even companies who have enormous amounts of cash at their disposal like apple take on massive debt because they can take advantage of the low interest rates interest rates when a lends money to b b repays the amount lent by a the capital as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that a has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation the interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low to take a very simple example if a borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5 the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed 10 million dollars plus 5 of the capital owed i e 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars in the second year he will again repay 10 of the capital borrowed but the 5 now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i e 4 5 million dollars or a total of 14 5 million dollars and so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5 of that remaining 10 million dollars i e 0 5 million dollars giving a total of 10 5 million dollars over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127 5 million dollars the repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments in the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years in this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher the nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted the real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation to lend the money they borrow to others apple and many other companies borrow to lend rather than to invest in production apple also borrows in order to buy its own stock on the market i explained this in an article entitled the mountain of corporate debt will be the seed of the next financial crisis published 14 november 2017 the speculative bubbles mentioned above are the result of the policies of the big central banks the federal reserve fed federal reserve officially federal reserve system is the united states central bank created in 1913 by the federal reserve act also called the owen glass act after a series of banking crises particularly the bank panic of 1907 fed decentralized central bank in the united states the ecb ecb european central bank the european central bank is a european institution based in frankfurt founded in 1998 to which the countries of the eurozone have transferred their monetary powers its official role is to ensure price stability by combating inflation within that zone its three decision making organs the executive board the governing council and the general council are composed of governors of the central banks of the member states and or recognized specialists according to its statutes it is politically independent but it is directly influenced by the world of finance the bank of england for the last ten years and the bank of japan since the bursting of the real estate bubble in the 1990s which have injected thousands of billions of dollars euros pounds sterling and yen into the private banks to keep them afloat these policies have been referred to as quantitative easing the financial resources the central banks have distributed so profusely have not been used for productive investments by the banks and major capitalist corporations in other sectors instead they have served to acquire financial assets stocks corporate bonds corporate bonds securities issued by corporations in order to raise funds on the money markets these bonds resemble government bonds but are considered to be more risky than government bonds and other guaranteed securities such as mortgage backed securities and therefore pay higher interest rates sovereign public securities structured financial products and derivatives derivatives a family of financial products that includes mainly options futures swaps and their combinations all related to other assets shares bonds raw materials and commodities interest rates indices etc from which they are by nature inseparable options on shares futures contracts on an index etc their value depends on and is derived from thus the name that of these other assets there are derivatives involving a firm commitment currency futures interest rate or exchange swaps and derivatives involving a conditional commitment options warrants etc etc that has created a speculative bubble on the stock market the bond market bond market a market where medium term and long term capital is lent borrowed in the form of bonds bonds are creditor stakes issued by companies or states and in certain places in the real estate sector all the major corporations are overindebted this policy on the part of the central banks demonstrates the fact that the decisions their directors make are determined totally by the short term interests of the major private banks and large capitalist corporations in other sectors namely preventing cascading failures and the resulting considerable losses for their large shareholders this policy also stems from a characteristic of contemporary financialized capitalism a smaller and smaller part of the new value that is created is reinvested in production see fran√ßois chesnais de nouveau sur l impasse √©conomique historique du capitalisme mondial read 17 march 2019 an increasing part of that new value is spent in the form of dividends for shareholders re purchases of shares and speculative investments in particular in structured products and derivatives fran√ßois chesnais mentions an ever more massive influx of non reinvested profits of financial groups with a strong industrial component let s return to the policy adopted by the central bankers to face the crisis that broke out in 2007 2008 their intervention did not result in cleaning up the system on the contrary the weakest elements were maintained or increased the ratio between equity equity the capital put into an enterprise by the shareholders not to be confused with hard capital or unsecured debt the company s capital and the debt taken on by the company is much too low that ratio is not sufficient to deal with the loss of value that would be caused by a fall in the price of stocks bonds or other financial assets held by the company be it a bank or a company like apple or general electric to use only two examples all companies are heavily indebted because borrowing costs them very little since interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set rates are very low 0 in the eurozone 0 1 in japan 0 75 in the uk and 2 5 in the usa and huge masses of capital are seeking maximum financial yield yield the income return on an investment this refers to the interest or dividends received from a security and is usually expressed annually as a percentage based on the investment s cost its current market value or its face value even if it means buying junk debt securities issued by companies in financial trouble thus companies like apple which have good reputations in terms of financial health borrow funds and use them to purchase junk securities with high yields the failing companies who issue these high yield junk securities conduct an ongoing policy of indebtedness they borrow in order to repay earlier loans in late december 2018 a major stock market crash nearly happened in the usa and the contagious effect was immediate it was yet another signal of an impending major crash the real estate market in the us has once again become fragile real estate prices have increased by 50 since 2012 reaching a higher level than they were at just before the crisis that began in 2005 2006 and caused the huge international crisis of 2008 2009 some specialists feel that we might be on the edge of a new real estate crisis because sales of homes are decreasing and business is slowing continued quantitative easing in europe and its supposed end in the usa are both crisis factors the big private banks referred to as systemic are extremely fragile and the value of their shares dropped sharply in the us and in europe in the second half of 2018 with the drop continuing in the first quarter of 2019 the big private banks are being kept on life support by the central banks of their respective countries the fed is not honouring its commitment to sell off toxic private debt securities the famous mortgage mortgage a loan made against property collateral there are two sorts of mortgages 1 the most common form where the property that the loan is used to purchase is used as the collateral 2 a broader use of property to guarantee any loan it is sufficient that the borrower possesses and engages the property as collateral backed securities or mbs mbs mortgage backed securities see abs in march 2019 it still held an enormous volume of 1 600 billion in mbs see read 17 march 2019 acquired in 2008 2009 from the big banks in order to bail them out the fed knows very well that if it were to massively sell these mbs as it promised to do their price would plummet and the collapse would take the bond bond a bond is a stake in a debt issued by a company or governmental body the holder of the bond the creditor is entitled to interest and reimbursement of the principal if the company is listed the holder can also sell the bond on a stock exchange market in the united states down with it it also knows that if it were to increase the interest rate to above 2 5 a large number of indebted companies would face serious difficulties in repaying refinancing their debts not to mention that it would also increase the cost of repaying public debt the ecb on the other hand continues lending cash to banks at 0 interest and has just promised them not to increase that rate before 2020 see martine orange la bce face √† ses limites the ecb up against its limitations published 8 march 2019 and delphine cuny la tribune la bce choque les march√©s en repoussant la hausse des taux the ecb shocks the markets by postponing rate increase published 7 march 2019 in addition the ecb is going to grant the private banks more massive middle and long term loans called tltros targeted longer term refinancing operations the italian and spanish banks are the ones who need this credit most according to jpmorgan they account for 55 of the amount borrowed during the last round of tltros but since all banks are interconnected they all depend more or less directly on them we should add that the european banks massively spend the money they borrow at zero interest to purchase sovereign debt sovereign debt government debts or debts guaranteed by the government preferably from their own states but also from other european states which brings them a positive yield on securities that are considered safe because they are issued by the state the infatuation with public debt securities on the part of the banks and the other participants in the financial markets is impressive all the states in the eurozone have succeeded in borrowing large sums over the first three months of year 2019 as they did in 2018 each new bond issue announcement is answered by a flood of purchase offers generally when a state wants to borrow 1 billion the banks offer 4 billion that s how much cash they have on hand cash that comes largely from the central banks that serve them that s how eager they are to buy profitable safe public debt securities further as i explained in my book bankocracy buying government bonds lets banks artificially increase their debt to equity ratio with the help of the system that allows them to weight assets by risk see dancing on the volcano and bankocracy chapter 12 but as soon as the crisis takes a catastrophic turn the dominant media and the bankers will once again accuse states of engaging in excessive public spending and issuing too much debt very weak growth in general stagnation or strong recession in a number of cases economic growth in the old most industrialized countries remains weak and is down in several key countries in particular in europe where after slight growth in 2017 the year 2018 ended with stagnation and in germany s case a drop in industrial production in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 financial times german industrial production drops unexpectedly 11 march 2019 the german authorities have revised their growth forecast downward for 2019 to 1 whereas in 2016 2017 the annual growth rate was above 2 investments in the eu took 12 years to return to the level where they stood in 2007 before the outbreak of the crisis financial times eu investment rebounds to level before 2008 financial crash 9 march 2019 in the eurozone growth in the third quarter of 2018 was only 0 2 the lowest figure in four years italy is in recession france has experienced a slight upturn thanks to a slight increase in consumption the result of the gilets jaunes yellow vests movement which led french president macron to break with fiscal discipline see my article the challenges for the european left regarding debt and the banks 23 january 2019 in japan growth for the period april 2018 march 2019 is approximately 0 9 also down compared to 2017 the us economy is also in a slowdown phase the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries predicts growth at 2 5 in 2019 compared to 2 9 in 2018 other experts foresee a lower growth rate than that that led the united states federal reserve to temporarily suspend the increase in interest rates undertaken since late 2016 growth in china is still slowing even if china continues to act as the world s locomotive growth is forecast to be in the neighbourhood of 6 the lowest rate in 25 years in china a financial crisis can erupt at any time causing domestic and worldwide growth to plummet and deteriorating living conditions for hundreds of millions of chinese the economies of the other brics brics the term brics an acronym for brazil russia india china and south africa was first used in 2001 by jim o neill then an economist at goldman sachs the strong economic growth of these countries combined with their important geopolitical position these 5 countries bring together almost half the world s population on 4 continents and almost a quarter of the world s gdp make the brics major players in international economic and financial activities countries are also slowing with the exception of india which has a growth rate of a little over 7 russia is experiencing very weak growth around 1 2 in 2018 and a forecast of 1 3 for 2019 south africa was in recession during the first half of 2018 and is now seeing a slight upturn brazil which underwent a strong recession in 2015 2016 has returned to growth but only at a low rate of barely over 1 in 2018 serious crises are already affecting a series of so called emerging countries turkey argentina venezuela indonesia etc who are undergoing currency devaluations and major difficulties in continuing to repay external public and private debt a number of peripheral countries who are among the poorest in the world such as mozambique are facing an acute debt crisis it is only the beginning of a list that will only grow longer despite the very low level of economic growth worldwide and in particular in the major older highly polluting industrial countries the factors that contribute to accelerating climate change are not being attenuated we have visible proof of that in the effects of climate disruption and global warming we are witnessing directly all around the planet in light of this crisis whose dramatic consequences are increasing governments are content to merely pay lip service which fortunately is resulting in strong reactions among the population in general and among youth in particular an assessment of the ecb s actions we have seen that since the beginning of the 2007 2008 crisis the ecb has played a vital role in saving the big private banks and their owners and directors while at the same time guaranteeing the continuity of their privileges we can clearly see that without the ecb the big banks would have sunk and that would have forced the authorities to take very severe action against them we should add that the ecb s actions have increased the concentration of the banking sector for the benefit of the twenty or so major banks that play a dominant role the ecb has actively contributed to maintaining and developing banking monsters who are too big to fail in addition to bailing out the big shareholders of these major banks the ecb is charged with maintaining an inflation inflation the cumulated rise of prices as a whole e g a rise in the price of petroleum eventually leading to a rise in salaries then to the rise of other prices etc inflation implies a fall in the value of money since as time goes by larger sums are required to purchase particular items this is the reason why corporate driven policies seek to keep inflation down rate of around 2 from this point of view the ecb has failed because the inflation rate in the eurozone was only 1 6 in 2018 and was decreasing during the first quarter of 2019 the ecb has three more objectives which can be summarized as follows to defend the euro which is a straitjacket for the weaker european economies and for all the people of europe the euro is an instrument that serves the big private companies and the european elites the richest 1 the eurozone countries cannot devalue their currencies because they have adopted the euro but the weakest countries in the eurozone should devalue in order to recover competitiveness faced with economic giants like germany france benelux belgium holland luxembourg and austria countries like greece italy portugal and spain are restricted by their membership in the eurozone so the european authorities and governments implement internal devaluation devaluation a lowering of the exchange rate of one currency as regards others which in reality means pay cuts for the workers to consolidate the domination of europe s strongest economies benelux france germany where the big european corporations have their bases thus maintaining important differences between the strong european economies and the others to actively support the attacks of capital against labour in order to increase business profitability and to make the big european companies more competitive on the global market against competitors in the usa china japan korea etc one could cite many examples of the ecb s interventions in order to attain that goal in italy greece cyprus portugal ireland spain etc the ecb s determination to contribute to the ongoing attacks against the dispossessed has been clearly expressed once again in march 2019 the ecb and the eurosystem banks refused to return a part of the profits made at the expense of the greek people to greece under the pretext that the government of alexis tsipras had not carried social counter reforms far enough one such counter reform pushed by the ecb was to eliminate the last existing obstacles to expelling greeks who are unable to continue repaying mortgage debts on their homes no sacrifice is too great to ask of the greek people who are the expiatory victims of the troika troika troika imf european commission and european central bank which together impose austerity measures through the conditions tied to loans to countries in difficulty imf within which the ecb plays a key role the need for radical solutions the approaching new financial crisis falls within a much broader systemic crisis of global capitalism and is multi faceted with economic environmental social political moral and institutional dimensions we need to make a radical break with the mind set of today s leaders and take urgent measures those who are responsible for bank meltdowns must be obliged to pay for the bailouts as opposed to the current system of giving golden handshakes to those responsible for the economic disasters instead of holding them accountable the measures announced to regulate the banks are superficial centralised supervision of eurozone banks creation of a european deposit guarantee scheme prohibition of certain operations concerning only 2 of global banking activities capping of bonuses transparent banking activities and even the new banking rules are merely recommendations promises or at best completely inadequate measures compared to the problems to be resolved instead strict universally applicable rules must be imposed to get beyond this crisis measures that would affect the very structure of the financial world and capitalist system should be implemented the banking business is too crucial to be left in the hands of the private sector the banking sector must be socialized which means expropriating the banks and placing them under popular control by bank employees customers associations and representatives of local public institutions because banks should be run as a public service and the revenues generated by banking activities used for the common good public debt incurred to save the banks is clearly illegitimate and must be repudiated a popular audit must be conducted to determine other illegitimate illegal odious or unsustainable debts and to help to create mobilisation through which a credible anti capitalist alternative can emerge these two measures must become part of a broader programme which we have laid out elsewhere see gilets jaunes yellow vests learning from history and acting now the central banks must be radically reformed and their missions must be redefined they must resume their role of printing money and contribute actively to financing the environmental transition and the struggle against social injustice citizen mobilization and social self management are indispensable conditions for putting the different proposals for solutions into practise

surely you ve noticed it dangerous domestic and global events have become the rule rather than the exception unstable governments are printing worthless money left and right u s gdp growth is on the verge of going negative for the first time in 60 years china s economic deceleration has reached a shocking magnitude apple stock plunged 30 without warning in fact 2020 started as the most volatile year for the s p since the 2009 economic crisis these and more signs have become a wake up call for americans who haven t effectively diversified their retirement portfolios in an effort to protect their assets and legacies many are scrambling for protection from the ravages of dollar devaluation market collapse or any other type of cataclysmic economic occurrence that may result from the current unstable conditions with warning signs suggesting trouble could strike the american economy at any moment many americans are turning to gold iras gold is frequently recommended by top financial advisors for portfolio diversification but given current economic conditions it s more important than ever that every american considers its benefits when planning for the future global tensions an oversold stock market and skyrocketing u s debt are weighing heavily on the global economic condition all this pressure has created the potential for dramatic financial loss at a moment s notice even greater than the more protracted 2008 correction it s always critical to diversify a portfolio but in this difficult financial environment the need has become urgent and many experts are claiming the protections provided by a gold ira could shine as the most brilliant solution goldco the leading gold company in the us is offering free gold ira eligibility checks to jp readers it s never been easier to find out if you qualify for a 100 tax free gold ira transfer 4 reasons to consider gold in 2019 here are just 4 of the largest current threats to the global economy which all point to the viability of a gold ira to diversify your retirement portfolio 1 global tensions and conflicts north korea s disarmament plans have ground to a halt the u s decision to renege on the iranian nuclear deal has tensions high and the recent u s backing of jerusalem as israel s capital has further fanned the growing flames of perceived u s mideast interference another group of foreign diplomats are uneasy about u s support for venezuela s opposition leader juan guaido and today s lower oil prices could become a distant memory if a host of middle east relations do not improve and quickly all of these factors can cause sudden chaos in the stock market but rarely impact gold prices heavily 2 u s national debt it s not only concerning that we ve passed the 22 trillion deficit mark but even more concerning is the fact that the last 1 trillion was added in less than a year for the first time ever 22 trillion is more than the entire u s economy this condition is not only unsustainable there appears to be no planned end in sight erosion of the dollar s value continues as baby boomers continue to file for social security from a fund that s been hemorrhaging for decades china and russia are lobbying and eager to fill a void being created by a continuing decline of the dollar s value 3 banking blunders and bail ins a big part of the 2008 financial meltdown had to do with a bank s misuse of derivatives which in 2018 achieved heights exponentially greater than 2008 levels and for all the complaining about dodd frank the one thing that no one seems to be aware of is actually the most important fact all bank deposits immediately become bank assets in the event of insolvency this means taxpayers are no longer a bank s first line of defense instead that privilege has been quietly dumped onto depositors your checking or savings accounts can now legally and without recourse be commandeered for the bank s own financial needs 4 an oversold stock market top analysts have been warning about the growing possibility of a market crash even greater than the one experienced during the great depression they hurry to point out the suspicious lack of significant corrections during the recent bull market which became the longest in our history last year just one factor in their concerns is the fact that public companies borrowed 1 1 trillion in cheap fed money made available by the fed s notorious quantitative easing program which was earmarked for wage increases infrastructure and expansion then they spent 1 2 trillion on stock buyback programs that inflated stock prices but did virtually nothing beneficial for the company particularly in potential growth or even maintenance these warnings signs have led analysts predict a 70 correction this year in fact the cia s financial threat advisor jim rickards even stated on money morning that he believes a 70 drop is the best case scenario it s never been a better time in history to consider holding physical gold why gold and why now you don t need to be a history buff to realize that gold has been universally accepted as a revered and valuable asset for centuries gold has never been negatively affected by the collapse of any country s fiat currency and can readily be converted to any other currency or asset companies can go bankrupt and stocks can go to zero value but gold has a brilliant history of retaining value especially during turbulent economic times gold has attributes desired by a growing list of new technologies within the computing electronic and medical fields many of these technologies consume or utilize gold thereby generating an even greater demand gold has a history of long term appreciation as well as maintaining or growing in value especially when other traditional financial instruments falter or collapse entirely in addition gold prices skyrocketed after the 2008 collapse meaning those who invest early could be in for the same rewards as those who invested in 2005 and 2006 the ounce price back then was as low as 417 73 today that number has tripled time may be running out a gold ira has proven the ideal choice for many americans who don t want to worry about losing everything due to factors outside their control however those who wish to diversify with a gold ira are smart to act quickly to gain maximum protection and even potential rewards in a worst case scenario a market crash combined with dollar devaluation could quite literally wipe out practically any portfolio without appropriate protection top financial advisors agree that gold is a necessary ingredient for providing appropriate protection for financial portfolios today primarily because it has the ability to respond in opposition to other financial instruments during a crisis what are the specific advantages of a gold ira today not every american with a retirement portfolio knows this but they ought to the taxpayer relief act of 1997 and section 408 of the irs code identifies and permits qualified americans to utilize a specialized self directed ira in order to put a variety of irs approved physical precious metal products into a tax advantage account this means a traditional gold ira allows americans to invest up to age based annual limits on a tax free basis even though a roth gold ira requires taxes to be paid on investment funds up front it also permits unlimited growth without taxation upon distribution in addition to the potential tax advantages mentioned based on the type of gold ira there are more important reasons to include physical precious metals in your retirement portfolio in spite of excitement over the longest bull market in american history since the start of the millennium gold appreciation has outperformed the djia stock market by more than 4 to 1 210 to 51 gold shines brightest during economic and geopolitical uncertainty domestic and global recession and any other type of monetary or market decline gold is wealth insurance because it stores value while acting as a currency hedge and safe haven asset gold mitigates investment risk and puts you in control of your own portfolio security gold is not an iou fiat currency or promissory note gold is a physical asset that can provide peace of mind to those concerned with market and banking operations experts say add gold to your retirement portfolio even the most renowned financial experts in the world rarely agree on the best way to grow a retirement account however those same experts do manage to agree on the need for gold and other precious metals to be held within a retirement portfolio regardless of your investment preference whether it s bonds stocks or real estate as the 2008 economic decline will attest an appropriate percentage of physical gold in a gold ira or retirement portfolio can protect from the negative and dangerous effect of falling values currency devaluations and inflation can also be detrimental to a retirement account but gold holds its own and can even thrive in those conditions how you can get your gold ira americans have three choices when it comes to gold iras 1 you can create an entirely new gold ira account 2 you can transfer and convert your existing ira 3 you can rollover the account if you have funds from a qualified retirement plan such as a self employed pension thrift savings plan 401 k or other qualified plan early

introduction west africa and the sahel continue to be plagued by fragility conflict and violence faced with challenges ranging from the spread of boko haram to persisting food insecurity forced displacement and youth unemployment the region needs help in response the international community has marshalled significant resources to support governments in fostering the essential preconditions for peace inclusive security and sustainable development such tasks can devour the funds of even the most ambitious aid programmes while the reality of budgetary constraints calls for a constant search for efficiency the european union s engagement in security sector reform ssr is a case in point transforming security and justice systems in fragile states is one of the top priorities of the eu s external action according to its 2016 ssr framework the eu will help partner countries put the military under civilian oversight and provide effective legitimate and accountable security and justice services to their citizens 1 eu programmes will apply a comprehensive approach aimed at i formulating integrated security and justice policies and setting up national coordination mechanisms ii providing training and non lethal equipment to defence and security forces and iii building internal accountability mechanisms and systems for human resources planning budgeting and financial management 2 in 2017 2 5 billion in official development assistance oda managed by the european commission was allocated to governance and civil society including ssr 3 there are ongoing or planned rule of law security and justice programmes in more than 40 countries worldwide 4 in west africa eu institutions have channeled over 100 million to finance the nascent 5 000 strong g5 sahel joint force while assistance for stabilisation in the region has reached 400 million 5 the eu has also launched three common security and defence policy csdp missions in mali and niger capacity building missions eucap provide technical assistance training and equipment for internal security forces to fight against terrorism organised crime and irregular migration the eu training mission in mali eutm has been helping the government to restructure eight army battalions 6 france has deployed 4 000 soldiers for operation barkhane in mali niger and chad an endeavour that costs about 600 million per year 7 meanwhile development funding to improve security outcomes by tackling the root causes of conflict has also risen the eu emergency trust fund for africa allocated almost 1 billion to lake chad and the sahel with projects in mali niger nigeria and senegal supporting youth employment private sector development social protection health and education 8 given the scale of the investment the following questions arise what is the value for money of each additional euro spent on strengthening west africa s armies and police how can ssr assistance lead to effective and sustainable reforms and ultimately contribute to reduce fragility conflict and violence this brief seeks to answer these questions by analysing the introduction and implementation of the security sector public expenditure review per a public sector governance instrument that assesses the economy effectiveness and efficiency of governments security and defence allocations including ssr programmes developed by the world bank in partnership with the united nations this data driven assessment tool can facilitate a policy dialogue between civilian administrators soldiers and diplomats on the affordability of armies and police and can therefore maximise the impact of security assistance programmes following an overview of security expenditures in west africa the brief outlines the genesis of security sector pers and highlights lessons learned from implementation in liberia mali and niger the conclusion then offers recommendations on how pers can be applied by the eu to ensure affordability and national ownership of defence and security assistance programmes the costs of west africa s security greater eu assistance comes at a time when west african security forces are getting a makeover historically african militaries have been grossly underfunded sometimes because political leaders sought to deliberately weaken them and create unaccountable loyal parallel structures the result has been poorly equipped ill trained armies who cannot neutralise security threats and in some cases become drivers of conflict in and of themselves 9 figure 1 increases in total military personnel 2012 2016 data world bank 2019 but amidst more intense regional cooperation this trend has started to change according to the stockholm international peace research institute sipri military expenditures in africa rose by nearly 50 between 2007 2017 measured in constant 2016 us dollars 10 in the sahel mali more than doubled the number of soldiers from 8 000 to 18 000 between 2012 2016 while the personnel of the nigerian armed forces grew by 25 between 2014 2015 see figure 1 spending on defence in burkina faso mali and niger more than doubled in the past five years as a share of gdp military expenditures have nearly tripled with the notable exception of chad while most g5 sahel countries allocate 10 15 of government spending to their armed forces see figure 2 11 figure 2 military expenditures in the sahel data sipri 2019 security investments become even more significant when factoring in police and gendarmerie whose numbers are difficult to compile due to cross country variations in organisational models for example nigeria s defence spending which far exceeds that of other countries in west africa and topped 2 billion in 2018 has been decreasing both in absolute terms as well as as a share of gdp and government expenditures this figure however does not cover the money allocated for police whose standing force of 400 000 is double the size of the army even so nigeria s army has deployed to all 36 states since 2015 a decision that both reflects and contributes to police malfunctioning indeed the world internal security and police index wispi which measures capacity process legitimacy and security outcomes places nigeria s police at the bottom of the global list of 127 countries analysed in 2016 12 the value added of pers in the security sector more spending on defence and security is only the initial step in guaranteeing long term peace and stability for both international actors and national authorities the greater challenge is to ensure that security expenditures are affordable efficient and effective in other words what is the value for money of each additional euro targeted at west africa s armies and police how can donors and governments ensure that support is actually making a difference will african governments jeopardise their long run economic prospects if they invest more in their security forces answering such questions requires a data driven policy instrument that links ssr priorities with economic and financial resource management at the government s request pers examine government resource allocations within and among sectors assessing the economy efficiency and effectiveness of those allocations within a country s macroeconomic context in addition a per identifies the reforms needed in the budget cycle to improve the efficiency of public spending assessing risks to public financial management pfm systems 13 although pers are the bread and butter of economists and public finance experts the nexus with the security sector originates in the 2011 world development report wdr on conflict security and development which called for applying public sector governance tools to improve security and justice services in fragile states 14 the wdr 2011 underscored that the basic framework for expenditures should be the same for the military police and criminal justice system as for other sectors like health and education before spending money governments should test the rationale for budget allocations and understand how these allocations affect the economy as a whole they should also carefully study how paying more for military hardware and people inputs relates to actual combat or policing missions outputs and ultimately to stability and public safety outcomes figure 3 public expenditure reviews in the security sector an overview data world bank 2017 pers of armies and police in fragile states thus provide a common platform for soldiers diplomats and economists to tackle these questions together as shown in figure 3 they must first trace how security threats determine defence and public safety priorities and investigate how the military police and possibly the gendarmerie are organised to achieve them for example if a country is confronted with high levels of organised crime why is the army in charge of the government s response and not the police if there is a presidential guard does it duplicate any of these roles and is it better financed once these answers are clear the per will then look into how money people and assets are allocated and managed by these institutions for instance according to the public expenditure and financial accountability framework pefa policy based budgeting is among the pillars of good public sector governance because it allows policymakers to direct resources on the basis of clear goals and thus improve public service delivery 15 are budget allocations for the military or police made on the basis of concrete strategies and policies do policymakers debate the rationale for additional spending or are security institutions the privileged recipients of funds irrespective of budgetary constraints with greater clarity on the macro picture the per will then delve into budget execution and oversight for example do the soldiers on the payroll actually exist are they paid on time how is cash managed and are poor logistics affecting the speed and success of troop deployments in battle here some typical challenges include minimising the cost of resources maximising the outputs i e get more bang for the buck and measuring progress on security outcomes these criteria are known as the three es economy efficiency and effectiveness 16 lessons from per implementation in liberia mali and niger the security sector pers undertaken by the world bank at the specific request of the governments in liberia mali and niger between 2012 2014 hold valuable lessons for ssr programming lessons vary in their objectives scope and depth in liberia 2012 the per was a joint un world bank exercise which examined the costs of transitioning away from a un led peacekeeping mission to the provision of security solely by national authorities in mali 2013 the per identified risks and vulnerabilities in the public financial management of the army and police while also running some long term cost projections in niger 2014 the report forecasted rising defence expenditures in the wake of the malian crisis these analyses helped tackle sensitive policy issues with facts and data breaking down the usual silos that emerge between soldiers scrambling to put together functional security institutions and economists concerned with the long term implications of additional security spending on development knowing what to spend on at the macro level the pers in each country had to determine how security threats factor into spending priorities in liberia the 2012 per used policy objectives identified in the threat assessment prepared for the national security strategy together with the un the assessment concluded that stability was at risk of being undermined by disputes over land high youth unemployment and the large numbers of demobilised soldiers and ex combatants about 117 000 in total liberia s porous borders also made it vulnerable to political tensions and insecurity spilling over from c√¥te d ivoire guinea and sierra leone 17 in mali work on the per started once the military junta that had staged a coup d √©tat in 2012 agreed to an ecowas brokered transition national security threats were far more urgent with the army having to recover from desertions resulting from defeats to tuareg rebels and regain lost territory in the north while negotiating the transfer of power back to civilians in niger public safety was undermined by urban crime and disputes over land and livestock while externally the crises in libya and mali challenged the army s ability to deter rebel attacks from abroad how did these trends shape strategic objectives in liberia the potential for internal disorder to escalate into large scale violent confrontations meant that the police became central to achieving stability by contrast the army was less important because external threats such as an invasion or proxy war were not foreseen as likely 18 the opposite was true in niger after the fall of the libyan regime the nigerien army mounted the malib√©ro operation in which some 1 200 men were deployed to monitor the circulation of arms fight terrorism and deter an armed rebellion in the north 19 the short run military response was complemented by the security and development strategy in the sahel sahara which aimed to boost the capacity of the army and border police as well as deliver services such as health education and transport in sparsely populated areas vulnerable to security shocks 20 meanwhile the response to insecurity in mali was primarily driven by the urgent need to recapture the north from rebel control and set up a un led peacekeeping mission linking security threats to spending priorities is always easier on paper than in reality yet an explicit policy consensus between security forces civilians international organisations and bilateral donors matters for several reasons first a systematic dialogue between defence and finance officials is missing even in developed countries where the quality of public sector governance is higher and civilian control over the armed forces is more entrenched such a dialogue is far more urgent in west africa where the pervasiveness of fragility and conflict require governments to make difficult short run trade offs between security and development expenditures second disaggregating budget allocations between the military and police and comparing them against national security objectives can help decision makers better understand how defence and security functions are funded this is a first order challenge in africa where threats to public order are often contained through internal military deployments rather than effective policing third identifying the right spending decisions can help donors and international organisations better direct their funding to alleviate the most pressing shortcomings affecting defence and police knowing what is affordable new security investments can weigh heavily on national budgets in mali the 2012 coup and the territorial dispute in the north introduced new risks to medium term macroeconomic stability previously the country had grown at 5 between 2005 2010 yet a drought in 2011 led to a decline in growth and 1 5 contraction in real gdp as a result government revenues fell by 30 21 this happened at a time when the post coup transition and the rebellion in the north required the government to spend more on defence and security thus while revenues fell security sector budget allocations went up by 37 while the proportional weight of security expenditures in the general budget doubled the mali per looked into whether this increase was fiscally sustainable under various scenarios constructed based on the country s medium term budget framework the report concluded that defence and security spending could range anywhere between 9 and 25 of the budget in the near future three stabilising factors helped minimise this impact i the resumption of the external budget support following the ecowas brokered transition deal ii the ability of the government to increase domestic revenue collection and iii the deficit targets set by the government as a result defence and security spending was expected to account for around 12 of the budget and could be affordable if the government redirected money from other sectors 22 the impact of growing security costs on fiscal space was more clear cut in liberia the per estimated that the total cost of maintaining public order between 2012 2019 stood at 712 million the bulk of this amount accounted for salaries allowances and pensions paid to the liberian forces as well as non wage recurrent costs such as equipment maintenance however given the revenues projected in liberia s medium term expenditure framework mtef the per estimated that a financing gap of 86 million would emerge between 2012 2018 to address this shortfall the study recommended that the ministry of finance join the national security council to explore ways to reallocate funds or identify cost cutting measures together with officials in uniform 23 in niger the per measured the impact of rising security expenditures on the overall fiscal deficit prior to the crisis in libya and mali niger s mtef forecast a downward trend in defence and security spending this was difficult to justify given existing threats as well as the urgent capital investments in the army the per determined that multiyear security sector budget estimates were neither realistic nor achievable all things being equal and without taking personnel expenditures into account it would have taken over 30 years to respond to the needs that were deemed priority needs 24 the per put forth multiple scenarios based on pre crisis security spending levels and revenues but also examined the possibility that rising threats and renewed military engagements would become the new normal in the most pessimistic projections the investments wanted by the ministries of defence and internal security would have required additional revenues from taxation or more foreign aid affordability analyses of defence and security reveal that fragile states in west africa must make tough trade offs when financing people in uniform investments in equipment or personnel necessary to enhance the state s monopoly on the means of violence are unavoidable if countries want to control large portions of territory even when massive fiscal deficits can be averted as in mali reallocations from other sectors or additional external assistance may be needed moreover external security assistance can be the make it or break it factor between financially realistic and untenable security investments yet none of the pers examined this issue in depth off budget funding for military and police thus remained off limits knowing how to care for assets and people analyses of macro fiscal implications of security and defence spending can thus anchor ssr planning within realistic budget envelopes but investigating budget execution brings to light financial management challenges that can undermine not only long term affordability but also the operational effectiveness of militaries and police in niger the lack of effective asset management was one of the main challenges to the pfm integrity of the armed forces a strong asset management capacity has two advantages first it helps ensure that equipment is efficiently allocated to operative units second it helps reduce transparency risks and prolongs the life of the equipment which contributes to a better economic return on investments new investments in security between 2010 2012 resulted in additional recurrent costs for supplies and people but the security personnel in charge of equipment were insufficiently trained and departments lacked consistent standard operating procedures internal control of asset management was largely on paper and regular power outages limited backup capacities 25 mali faced similar challenges in 2012 the armed forces acquired approximately 160 troop carrying vehicles five tank carriers light and heavy weapons as well as t 55 tanks money for maintenance and upkeep was scarce and the majority of funds were centrally managed by a directorate which decided on a case by case basis whether to honour requests for repairs or parts that were too costly this practice caused delays that were detrimental to actual military operations against rebels this problem could have explained why the army kept an entirely separate special account for the northern zone but this too was a major source of vulnerability in the pfm system because there was no real spending ceiling the purpose and operating conditions of the special account were not adhered to and budget charges lacked transparency 26 in liberia human resource management of internal security forces emerged as one of the central challenges in the transition to domestic security provision the police had weak command and control functions it numbered 4 200 people in 2012 but had to double its size to effectively take over public order management from the un a real challenge for the police academy moreover the government had to establish a new pay and grading structure as well as incentives for promotions 27 while these challenges are typical for police where the payroll accounts for as much as 80 of costs they are particularly relevant for african militaries too in niger and mali the governments had to spend a lot of money on new equipment but in many other countries effective ssr is complicated by weak personnel management as top heavy armies with imbalanced rank pyramids cannot execute operations effectively an analysis conducted by the un in guinea bissau revealed that resource mismatches and political capture had weakened the military over the past three decades for example in the army there was a rise in promotions based on political patronage in the 1990s it only had one general while in 2009 it had 17 and in 2016 there were 37 as such 80 of soldiers were over the age of 40 in 2016 and with no retirement structure in place most soldiers preferred to stay in the ranks as shown in figure 4 only 31 of the roughly 4 000 soldiers were enlisted troops 28 figure 4 army personnel structure in guinea bissau data iss aftrica 2019 implications for eu security assistance in west africa since armies and police embody state power looking into how much money people in uniform spend and how effectively they work is a high risk project development banks and financial institutions can provide the technical know how to assess defence and security expenditures with public finance tools data and sound technical analysis can help match ssr ambitions with the realities of budgetary constraints for these reasons and looking at the lessons from west africa s case studies the potential of security sector pers to create value added in eu ssr programmes is significant since 2006 most of the 35 csdp missions included programmes to reform police or improve the policy coordination between security and justice institutions but an evaluation conducted in 2016 to help craft the eu s new ssr framework argued for several improvements these included grounding programmes in deeper local knowledge synchronising technical support with diplomatic efforts to secure the buy in of national authorities and shifting away from project based interventions to more sustainable budget support what more could be done 29 first the eu could require security sector pers as preconditions for deploying new financing for ssr or security assistance more broadly the european development fund edf has disbursed 2 2 billion to the african peace facility since its creation to finance african led peace operations build the capacity of the african union commission and provide funds for emergency response 30 the edf could also be used as an instrument for ssr in africa by financing large scale budget support for defence and security forces to this end findings of security sector pers could identify the conditionalities for the direct transfer of edf money to national budgets second the eu could work with its partners to transform security sector pers into standard instruments of international engagement similar to recovery and peacebuilding assessments rpbas rpbas are partnership frameworks which help donors international institutions and governments to align their programmes by identifying post conflict recovery priorities together 31 security sector pers could fulfil the same role for external support to armies police and courts whether on a national or regional basis for example out of 16 existing peacekeeping missions around the globe only two have been costed liberia and somalia the eu could thus work with bilateral and multilateral partners to make security sector pers mandatory for all such un missions which feature a peacekeeping mandate for west africa and the sahel the challenges posed by fragility conflict and violence are real and urgent whether by way of moral obligation or geopolitical interest more money and eu resources are now available to help countries in the region contain chaos and become more resilient but only the best technocratic instruments can maximise the value of such investments turning strategic visions into concrete results security sector pers are one such instrument which the eu could deploy to become an even more effective security provider in west africa references paul m bisca is security and development

the stock made a high of 306 3 and reversed sharply lower on friday giving back almost all the gains made during the week an immediate support for the stock is at 295 a break below it can drag the stock lower to 288 or 286 a further fall below 286 looks less likely now an upward reversal from the 288 286 support zone can take sbi higher to 295 and 300 levels again such a bounce will be a good opportunity to enter long positions again from a short term perspective a strong break and decisive close above 305 is needed for sbi to regain strength such a break can take the stock initially higher to 310 and 315 levels a further break above 315 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its up move to the level of 320 the region between 315 and 320 is a crucial medium term resistance whether sbi surpasses this resistance zone or not will decide the direction of the next move supports to limit the downside in itc 297 7 itc sustained above its support at 288 and rallied over 2 per cent last week the 300 302 resistance zone is capping the upside now if itc continues to trade below 300 a fall to 295 or even 290 cannot be ruled out but a further fall below 290 looks less probable as the indicators on the charts are positive the 21 day moving average has crossed the 200 day moving average a bullish sign indicating that the downside could be limited as such a bounce from 290 can take the stock higher to 300 again in such a scenario a range bound move between 290 and 302 is possible for some time an eventual decisive break above 303 will boost the momentum such a break will trigger a fresh rally targeting 310 it will also keep the possibility high of the stock revisiting 320 levels over the medium term investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at 282 278 and 272 with a revised stop loss at 285 move the stop loss further higher to 297 as soon as the stock moves up to 303 book profits at 310 infosys gears up for a fresh rally 742 15 infosys surged over 3 per cent last week breaking above the crucial resistance level of 730 the strong rally in the past week indicates the end of the downtrend that has been in place since february the weekly chart gives an early sign that a fresh leg of upmove could have just begun this upmove could be strong as infosys has risen after forming a strong base between 700 and 720 the short term outlook is bullish the 730 727 band will now act as a support and can limit the downside an upmove to 750 755 is likely in the near term a strong break and a decisive close above 755 will then increase the likelihood of the upmove extending to 780 the bullish outlook will get negated only if infosys declines below 725 such a break though unlikely can take the stock lower to 710 or 700 medium term traders can hold the long positions taken at 725 720 and 715 retain the stop loss at 680 for the target of 790 revise the stop loss higher to 735 as soon as the stock moves up to the level of 755 ril may dip before going up 1 342 1 ril surged about 5 per cent intra week but failed to sustain higher after making an intra week high of 1 386 6 the stock gave back most of the gains and closed 1 5 per cent higher for the week a near term support is at 1 316 as long as ril trades below 1 350 a dip to test 1 316 cannot be ruled out a break below 1 316 can drag ril further lower to 1 300 or 1 290 a further fall below 1 290 looks less likely as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at lower levels and limit the downside a bounce from 1 316 or the 1 300 1 290 support zone can take the stock higher to 1 350 a further break above 1 350 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting 1 380 and 1 400 levels thereafter the bullish outlook will get negated if ril declines decisively below 1 290 in such a scenario ril can fall to 1 250 investors can hold the long positions taken at 1 260 1 245 and 1 225 with a revised stop loss at 1 320 move the stop loss further higher to 1 345 as soon as ril touches the level of 1 375 book profits at 1 420 tata steel has a bullish bias 518 1 tata steel continued to consolidate for the third consecutive week the stock has been stuck in a narrow range between 505 and 532 a breakout on either side of 505 or 532 will determine the next move the price action on the chart leaves the bias bullish the stock is holding well above the 100 day moving average additionally the 21 day moving average has just crossed over the 100 day moving average this is a bullish signal indicating that the downside could be limited it also increases the possibility of the stock breaking the current range of 505 532 on the upper side the ensuing target is 540 a further break above 540 will increase the likelihood of the stock targeting 560 but if tata steel declines below 505 it can fall to 495 or 490 medium term traders with high risk appetite can go long at current levels and accumulate on dips at 512 and 505 stop loss can be placed at 487 for the target of 555 revise the stop loss higher to 515 as soon as the stock moves up to 525 9 00 am index outlook the profit booking and selling pressure can continue in the coming week and the indices

expectations run too low then policy may have to be left on hold or perhaps even loosened to provide the appropriate accommodation to obtain our objectives on the other hand if growth runs close to its potential and inflation builds momentum then some further rate increases may be appropriate over time to ensure that the economy settles in on its long run sustainable growth path and that inflation runs symmetrically about our 2 percent target he added in this scenario the path for rates will depend crucially on any signals of an acceleration in core inflation though he emphasized that us economy is still in good shape he pointed to fed s forecasts of 1 75 2 0 gdp growth in 2019 evans said the lower end of this range is actually in line with my view of the economy s long run growth potential so we re not looking at a bad number though the economy won t feel like it is doing very well compared with last year s very strong performance former fed chair yellen yield curve inversion signals fed cut not recession former fed chair janet yellen said in a conference in hong kong that yield curve inversion doesn t indicate recession in the us economy ahead rather the development suggests that fed might need to cut interest rate simply put she said my own answer is no i don t see it as a signal of recession she explained in contrast to times past there s a tendency now for the yield curve to be very flat thus it s now easier for it to invert on the other hand yellen said it might signal that the fed would at some point need to cut rates but it certainly doesn t signal that this is a set of developments that would necessarily cause a recession boj harada unemployment rate won t be below 2 5 without qqe boj board member yutaka harada hailed that the quantitative and qualitative easing qqe program boosted productivity and drove down unemployment rate he said in a speech that the biggest contribution qqe has made to japan s economy was to boost its productivity also without qqe japan s jobless rate would not have fallen below 2 5 percent harada is a persistent dissent in boj s monetary policy decisions he complained regularly that allowing the long term yields to move upward and downward to some extent was too ambiguous as the guideline for market operations also he urged to introduce forward guidance that would further clarify its relationship with

we would like to begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and our perspective on the balance of fiscal year 2019 i will then turn the call over to bryan hughes our chief financial officer who will provide more detail on the related second quarter financial results then i will return to offer some closing comments before concluding the call with q a overall we are pleased with the strong start in the first six months of fiscal 2019 wholesale market conditions especially in our rv segments are even tougher than we had originally planned but we are gaining material consolidated retail and shipment market share as a company as we move into the second half of the year we will look to build on the momentum we created through all of our business segments we are committed to driving higher levels of profitability and asset utilization delivering sales results that continue to outpace the industries we serve and pursuing new growth opportunities that position winnebago industries and its brands for future success we are both simultaneously investing in the ability to grow whether it is talent expertise or through business development work and creating a more efficient organization operationally we remain committed to meaningful consistent market and financial progress in the short term but we are truly focused on creating a long term business model with a high performance engine for profitable growth in the years ahead and as a more diversified company focused on quality innovation and service we will continue to make solid progress toward our goal of transforming winnebago industries into a premier outdoor lifestyle company while the north american rv industry is experiencing some challenging wholesale headwinds the unique strength of our two rv brands winnebago and grand design and their positions in the market has allowed us to dramatically outpace the industry and we are seeing small but strategically important benefits from our new marine play in chris craft consolidated second quarter net revenues were down 7 6 for the quarter driven by dealer inventory rationalization in the rv space and comparing against strong shipments in the prior year what i am most pleased with is our growing rv retail market share ssi retail in the stand alone month of january 2019 showed our company with a market share position of 10 in rvs this is significant progress in fact three times greater from a position of under 3 just three years ago although we saw a decrease in our organic revenue growth we made further progress increasing our gross profitability consolidated gross profit margin increased 100 basis points in the quarter driven by revenue mix operational improvements within our motorized segment and the continued success of our cost mitigation efforts to more than offset rising input costs and heightened dealer incentives due to market conditions thanks to our discipline in managing our portfolio by controlling production pace and overall output and our team s efforts to safely navigate the challenging weather during the second quarter from which we lost many production and shipment days across our various businesses year to date operating cash flow increased over 200 versus last year now turning to the segments in more detail in our towables segment unit shipments for the quarter were down 10 4 while the decline is certainly a reflection of broader industry dealer destocking and a strong comparable period a year ago this result far exceeded the broader towable market which has been declining nearly two to three times that amount during the comparable period and demonstrates our success in continuing to gain dealer lot share our brands though have not been immune have certainly not been immune to the inventory corrective behavior for the quarter towables revenues decreased 5 9 from the fiscal 2018 period driven by the unit shipment declines mentioned previously but partially offset by pricing taken during the second half of fiscal 2018 and again in the early part of calendar year 2019 adjusted ebitda margins decreased by 20 basis points largely reflecting a competitive pricing environment and increased cost input pressures towable backlog for the quarter declined 5 7 in dollars over the prior year reflecting the positive impact of utilizing additional capacity added during calendar 2018 and dealers continuing to rightsize their inventory levels our dual branded towable rv lineup continues to outperform the market due to the strength of our products and their increasing appeal with customers new towable products were once again on full display at the recent rvx show in march in salt lake city including the new grand design transcend xplor and new floor plans for the winnebago branded spyder toy hauler and micro minnie fifth wheel given our strong showing at the rvx event and positive dealer feedback we continue to expect our retail prospects to remain strong and for towable segment sales to outpace the industry turning to the motorized segment we remain focused on revitalizing our motorized business and are taking steps to improve our ability to supply dealers and our end customers with a stronger lineup of high quality innovative products revenues for the segment were down 17 3 versus the prior year and adjusted ebitda margins were down 30 basis points the current industry environment has certainly weighed on our ability to grow the top line but we continue to focus on managing costs product mix implementing operational improvements to improve overall manufacturing efficiency and offsetting higher input costs all of which have led to stabilizing margins and even an increase on the gross profitability line what i am most pleased with regarding our recent motorhome performance is that stand alone retail results for winnebago branded motorhomes in both december and january were positive on a year over year basis this is a sign of good progress as you ve heard me say before energizing our motorized business remains a top priority for us as we have dedicated a considerable amount of energy and resources to this effort this includes our recent difficult decision to shift our winnebago branded class a diesel motorhome manufacturing from our junction city oregon plant to our manufacturing campus in ford city iowa this strategic transition consolidates and centralizes product development supply chain and assembly operations for the company s diesel and motorhome business back to a single location improving our overall efficiency in the future we have ample space access to labor and full intent to begin a market share recovery and profitability as set in this business in terms of our motorized backlog we did see a 38 6 decline from the prior year which reflects dealers continuing to rightsize inventory levels and prior year class b new productship backlog timing the rvx event in salt lake city also unveiled several new motorhome models for winnebago not currently included in the second quarter backlog numbers the new class b boldt the select edition national park foundation class b travato and the refresh class c view and navion series were just several of many positive product upgrades that dealers had the opportunity to review several weeks ago turning to our other segment we saw another full quarter of chris craft boat sales in our earnings results we continue to see strong traffic and demand for our marine products as demonstrated by the turnout we saw at the miami boat show in mid february which exceeded our expectations consumers are showing tremendous interest in the chris craft brand and its recent new products specifically the 28 and 35 gt launch and the catalina 27 pilothouse and it is translating into positive sales and shipment trends for that brand lastly our specialty vehicles segment is being overhauled strategically to grow profitably as well in the future we have shared our intentions in prior calls to focus on several segments accessibility enhanced electric vehicles and mobile specialty medical we are investing in new talent new capacity and new technology our all electric commercial vehicle platform recently received a top award at the rvx trade show in the sustainability category with that overview i will now turn the call over to bryan hughes to review our fiscal 2019 second quarter financials in more detail bryan bryan hughes vice president and chief financial officer thanks mike and good morning everyone second quarter consolidated revenues were 432 7 million a dre decrease of 7 6 compared to 468 4 million for the fiscal 2018 period driven by a decrease in rv unit sales and partially offset by the addition of chris craft and pricing actions taken during the last 12 months across all of the rv business units gross profit was 66 4 million a decrease of 1 8 compared to 67 7 million for the fiscal 2018 period gross profit margin increased 100 basis points in the quarter driven by favorable revenue mix pricing and motorized operational improvements which more than offset inflationary cost pressures and heightened dealer incentives second quarter operating income was 28 9 million a decrease of 18 compared to 35 3 million in the second quarter of last year driven primarily by the decline in rv unit sales unit sales growth in sg a during the quarter partially driven by ongoing and one time investments we are making in the business also contributed to the decline at operating income some of the one time investments referred to is a continuation of the strategic project that was discussed as a driver of the sg a increase in our first quarter this combined with the chris craft acquisition and associated amortization contributed 12 percentage points of the 16 increase in sg a in the quarter net income of 21 6 million a decrease of 2 2 compared to last year was favorably impacted by discrete tax items totaling 2 5 million or 0 08 earnings per share earnings per diluted share were 0 68 a decrease of 1 4 versus the same period last year we have provided non gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda performance measures in our press release as a comparable measure to clearly illustrate our performance the schedules accompanying the press release show a reconciliation between net income and adjusted ebitda consolidated adjusted ebitda was 34 5 million for the quarter compared to 39 4 million last year or a decrease of 12 4 now turning to the individual segments and starting with the towable segment revenues for the second quarter were 250 7 million down 5 9 year over year this decrease was primarily driven by continued dealer network efforts to reduce inventory levels we are also comparing against extremely strong shipments in the second quarter of last year segment adjusted ebitda for the second quarter was 33 6 million down 7 3 from the prior year and adjusted ebitda margins decreased 20 basis points reflecting enhanced price advances over the past year that did not fully offset inflationary input cost most notably materials turning now to motorized segment motorized revenues were 164 7 million for the quarter down 17 3 versus last year driven by a decrease in class a and class c unit sales partially offset by strong shipments of our class b products pricing also impacted sales but some of the benefit of the pricing actions we have taken over the past 12 months were offset by higher dealer incentives in the quarter segment adjusted ebitda was 4 4 million for the second quarter down 23 4 year over year adjusted ebitda margin decreased 30 basis points driven primarily by the decline in sales and further impacted by investments in sg a partially offset by favorable product mix related to the strength of class b relative to class a and class c turning to our balance sheet as of the end of the second quarter the company had outstanding debt of 276 9 million net of debt issuance costs of 6 4 million working capital was 175 3 million our current net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio was 1 6 times just above our targeted leverage ratio range of 0 9 to 1 5 times cash flow from operations was 51 9 million year to date up 36 9 million or approximately 250 from the same period last year as we continued to execute our transformation initiatives we are confident that the combined strength of our balance sheet and cash flow provide the flexibility to strategically invest in the business and investing in the growth of our business remains our top capital allocation priority the effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 12 8 compared to 27 2 for the same period in fiscal 2018 the favorable rate in the quarter versus last year was driven partially by the tax cuts and jobs act which drove a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21 recall last year we used the blended rate and also by identifying favorable discrete r d related tax credits this was made possible by our decision to invest in new talent in our tax function and in doing so we identified that we had an additional opportunity to capture further credits as endorsed by the tax code associated with our extensive r d activities total discrete tax items contributed 0 08 to our earnings per share for the quarter including the 12 8 tax rate for our fiscal second quarter we now anticipate our full fiscal year tax rate will approximate 22 we currently anticipate under the current tax code that our ongoing rate for our fiscal year 2020 and beyond will be approximately 23 to 24 finally our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0 11 per share payable on april 17 2019 to common stockholders of record at the close of business on april 3 2019 that concludes my review of our quarterly financials and with that i will now turn the call back to mike to provide some closing comments mike michael happe president and chief executive officer thanks bryan as you ve heard us mentioned this morning we are pleased with the progress we ve made in our fiscal year 2019 but we also recognize that there remain significant potential within our business for the future each quarterly report is not the final grade but a quiz on the way to hopefully a successful attainment of an advanced degree at winnebago industries we remain steadfast in the pursuit of our vision around becoming a trusted outdoor lifestyle our internal transformation efforts around talent process portfolio and capital allocation have not only advanced our competitive position in the industry but they have also made our company more resilient hopefully more consistent and able to better navigate the headwinds affecting the rv industry without surprising or dire consequences it is always two steps forward and one step back during these early stages and we aspire to much more in the future this resiliency is due in large part to our new enterprise platform approach which is more diversified than ever before with active full line rv luxury marine and specialty vehicle operations just three short years ago we were largely a one division organization with motorhomes representing 93 of our overall sales we are confident that over the next five to 10 years there will be significant opportunities for organic share expansion and inorganic investment in each of those global markets and as we said last quarter we continue to search for premium companies with strong brands great talent valued channel partnerships that deliver on the product and a promises they make to further leverage our strengths and expand our business next i d like to share with you my thoughts on some of the market challenges facing both the rv industry and its retail prospects for the remainder of 2019 although a sentiment in the broader rv market has maintained its bearish trajectory we remain optimistic about the long term retail prospects for the rv industry secular demand for camping being outdoors and generally collecting experiences versus possessions is continuing to grow across multiple lifestyle and demographic segments the versatility and breadth of what is called a recreational vehicle continues to expand and brings more and more interest to the space in the short term there remains a good deal of macroeconomic noise as it relates to the rv industry recent industry reports clearly show a decline in rv shipments in the first part of 2019 due to dealer inventory rationalization following unusually high seasonal orders in the previous year and retail that has slowed from years of double digit compound growth retail has likely been impacted by a variety of pressures higher product prices as a result of increased tariff and material costs higher interest rates due to increased fed fund costs from increases in the back half of calendar year 2018 volatility in the equities market uncertainty about 2018 tax returns for the middle class and a general sense of anxiety by end customers as they try to determine where the economy is truly headed in the next year as dealers are seeking to balance purchases with demand they are selling through existing inventories and carefully managing the quantity of new orders for new product they also recognize that most rv oems can now currently respond to new orders in a more timely manner these developments impacted our overall sales during the second quarter but it also served to validate the uniquely strong position our brands have in the market which provides us some insulation from macro headwinds and definite opportunity for the future we believe that we are poised to capture incremental growth as we enter the 2019 retail season despite the inventory related headwinds challenging the industry there are several tailwinds serving as positive indicators regarding future sales and growth opportunities consumer confidence has remained relatively stable and we are continuing to see our customers choose to invest their valuable discretionary resources on creating lasting outdoor experiences with family and friends reasonable fuel and oil prices continue to be a strong positive for our businesses lastly customers access to capital and financing remains strong as financing companies have for the most part avoided abnormally constraining credit availability the recent data from retail shows and certain sales data over the last several weeks has also been positive we re seeing retail showed traffic and sales come in ahead of expectations as both were expected to be down during the first part of the year this further demonstrates our resiliency and our ability to gain share and outperform our peers in a moderated market we are cognizant of the rv industry s wholesale shipment forecast for calendar year 2019 and support the association s forecast we also continued to believe that flat retail for the whole of calendar year 2019 is a good aspirational target for the industry as we said during our last call however we believe retail will more quickly be down low to mid single digits for the calendar year over the last 12 months winnebago industries consolidated rv retail growth our brands has consistently outperformed the industry by 15 to 20 basis points and we are confident in our ability to retain a double digit spread as we compete forward this calendar year one comment on the marine industry as we continue to learn quickly about this market through the tremendous team at chris craft the marine industry has been on a much steadier recovery trajectory for the last eight to nine years since the financial crisis certain categories have incurred momentum versus others chris craft is fortunate right now to be growing for multiple reasons channel commitment and expansion product line expansion and competitive shifts we are confident that chris craft will continue to meet and or exceed our m a model projections for their first full year and for the foreseeable future the integration continues to go well and best practices and chemistry due to the chris craft addition to our portfolio are building across the company we remain interested in the marine space as an opportunity to grow selectively and profitably as we look ahead to the second half of fiscal 2019 we are poised to maintain our track record of outpacing both the rv and the marine industry as it relates to top line sales profitability and share expansion we will continue to execute against our strategic priorities and work to be a high quality well managed company that investors can place their trust in finally i ll close with a comment regarding the recent board of director announcement over the past several years we have made changes to our business model leadership and strategies during this transformational period bob chiusano has played a key role as chair of the winnebago industries board of directors by leading with passion courage and sharing his significant operating expertise on behalf of all winnebago industries employees i d like to personally thank bob for his service as chair and for his ongoing service as a board member he and the board many of which are also new to winnebago industries in the last three and a half years have been both diligent but also supportive of the strategic journey that management has recommended bob was especially instrumental in the ceo leadership change process which occurred in the fall of 2015 and he will continue to be a valued director within our organization at the same we look forward to having david miles step up as our new chair the board has valued dave s financial expertise strategic insight and overall governance instincts over the past several years and now we re pleased to have him serve in his new role in the exciting years to come i look forward to working personally with dave to collectively drive this company to greater heights with that we will wrap up our formal comments for this morning thanks very much for your time today and i will now turn the line back over to the operator for the q a session questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of craig kennison with robert w baird your line is now open craig kennison robert w baird analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions the first one had to do with the class b market as you know there has been some disruption in that class b market that frankly may create an opportunity for winnebago how would you frame that opportunity and what are you doing to get after it michael happe president and chief executive officer yes good morning craig this is mike and i ll answer that question we are certainly aware of some of the developments specific to the roadtrek business in canada we are fortunate that winnebago industries and our motorhome business have a significant share position currently in class bs depending on the share reports on a monthly basis you look at it somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 roadtrek i believe has been consistently no 2 in those same share reports so certainly the disruption to their business at least in the short term and the unknown long term future of their business certainly has many end customers and dealers asking questions in our industry and we believe our brand winnebago and our current line of class b products and some new products that we have in our pipeline are well positioned to compete for any shifts in share organically that could happen in the future as well so our motorhome team is very intentionally focused on that part of our business they re engaged with our dealers about the opportunities for potential market share increases there and we will continue to be very focused on trying to serve the market with what we believe is the best line in the business that being the winnebago class b line craig kennison robert w baird analyst thanks and second question has to do with the 2020 plan that you outlined i think in november of 2017 based on your market share trend recently it appears you ve achieved one of those goals how do you feel about your plans to also achieve 10 operating margin and 10 of revenue from outside key rv segments michael happe president and chief executive officer yes thanks craig as many of you probably recall in november of 2017 at our investor day in new york city we did share four goals craig as you mentioned one of the goals was hoping to attain 10 north american rv market share by the end of 2020 we seem to be on good track to doing that and as my comments alluded we ve even seen winnebago industries achieve that mark on a stand alone monthly basis here just recently so we hope to maintain that position and candidly exceed that in the future the operating income goal is definitely a little bit tougher than we had anticipated in november of 2017 if you remember that was before most of the or many of the tariffs were formally put in place and some of the other material cost inflation had begun to impact our business and so i would say the 10 operating income goal is still one we will strive to achieve we hope to make good progress on that in the back half of our calendar year fiscal year 2019 but that is definitely a tougher goal so i would call that more of a stretch goal for the end of our fiscal 2020 but i can assure you it s one that we re still talking about on a daily basis the 10 new business goal had to do with achieving 10 of our net sales by the end of f 2020 on either new businesses that we were not in at the end of our fiscal 17 year or new product categories within our organic businesses that we were not in and that we ve made good progress against that goal with the acquisition of chris craft but also the introduction of some new products in the new rv categories such as the stick and tin business and grand design s entry into that so we re not at this point going to share any thoughts on specifics around further inorganic business development opportunities but we have i guess 18 months here to try to achieve that goal as well so stay tuned we appreciate you reminding us of those and we will do everything we can to make a very good progress if not attain both of those going forward craig kennison robert w baird analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of scott stember with cl king your line is now open scott stember c l king analyst good morning guys michael happe president and chief executive officer good morning scott scott stember c l king analyst mike in the press release you guys talked about i guess in your third quarter you would expect the industry would be i guess more of a state of equilibrium when weighing retail and wholesale but maybe just if you could just give us a little bit more granular expectations there on a monthly basis when you would expect that to actually hit a bottom and that will be my first question thanks michael happe president and chief executive officer thank you scott for the question yes i think the words we used in the press release were approaching an equilibrium in our quarter 3 we ve been i guess over the last six months relatively consistent that we had been hopeful that the shipment in retail levels would achieve some sort of new normal and equilibrium in the late spring early summer of 2019 i think specifically we have talked about april may candidly it s really anybody s guess i know different public companies in our sector have offered their own thoughts on this but we re still hopeful that especially for our business but increasingly so for the industry that you ll start to see that equilibrium happen again in late in our q3 could it spill over into june of into our early q4 it probably could as well i am personally pleased with the way spring is starting to break weather wise in certain parts of the country we have seen some seasonally good retail in some of the warmer weather states and we re waiting for that retail season to truly kick off in the northern part of the country and i think that last comment there will be probably the factor that will drive some of this timing a bit more when the dealers north of let s say the mason dixon line start to experience some hopefully good retail here so again we re sticking to late spring early summer and we hope that s the case if that s not the case our business is still well positioned to take retail market share at a minimum and hopefully outperform the industry scott stember c l king analyst that s great and as far as discounting goes i know you guys talked about that in the release it s one of the reasons for or one of the headwinds you had to go up against in the quarter from a gross margin perspective but i know that you ve talked about grand design has been steadfast about discounting or not discounting i just wanted to make sure that we re still talking about that factor and that you guys are still holding your ground as we go into the selling season michael happe president and chief executive officer yes we are very pleased with the performance of our grand design business they continue to do very positive things and as we ve stated since we ve owned them that we remain committed to the business model that made them successful in their early years and attractive as an acquisition target to us more than two years ago and we are pleased to report today that that business model is still in its entirety in place as they operate and that includes the discipline of not discounting on a quarterly basis as some other companies in the industry do and in fact some of our own winnebago branded products still have to do so the strength of the grand design product line and their relationships with the dealers allow them to run a good clean pure business there and we are working very intently to move our winnebago branded motorhome and winnebago branded towable businesses there in the future as well and that will take some time but we should be able to do that over time as our product lines get stronger there and as our positions on those dealer lots improve as well scott stember c l king analyst got it and just one last question on the motorized profitability side with the closing of the oregon facility i know there s going to be some transitory costs in the next quarter could you just remind us of i guess what we should be modeling and also what some of the low hanging fruit will be a couple of quarters out once some of those cost savings come in thank you bryan hughes vice president and chief financial officer yes this is bryan good morning i ll take that one so in q3 the costs incurred were immaterial so we didn t really speak to those sorry in q2 they were immaterial so we didn t really speak to those as being a driver for the quarter for q3 and q4 we expect them to be of the magnitude of 0 02 eps for each of those two quarters in 2020 we expect the savings and the cost to roughly offset each other and then in fiscal 21 and forward we expect about 4 million of savings in every year going forward so those are the metrics that we ve disclosed previously scott stember c l king analyst got it thanks for taking my questions guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve o hara with sidoti company your line is now open steve o hara sidoti and company analyst hi good morning can you just talk about the your expectations you gave kind of your retail expectations and i think you said that you thought you could continue to materially outperform i think back on the towable side but if you could just go into that a little more obviously i think as you grow maybe that gap begins to narrow just from a size standpoint but if you could just talk about maybe how you expect that motorhome to play out as well as you kind of continue to improve the results there thank you michael happe president and chief executive officer yes steve good morning our market share growth for most of the last several years has definitely been ignited by the towable segment growth in our business both the acquisition of a fast growing business in grand design but also the acceleration of our winnebago towables business as well which we re pleased to report over the last several years the size of the business has more than doubled and the profitability of that business dollar wise on the bottom line has tripled so both our towables businesses have been contributing to the market share growth but i think that s where you ll continue to see our industry outperformance happen led by grand design supported by winnebago towables as both of those companies continue to expand their product lines introduce new products strengthen their dealer relationships and even in some markets upgrade and or find their way into new dealer relationships that position us better in those particular markets i did mention in my comments this morning that we are extremely pleased that our winnebago motorhome business has had two consecutive stand alone months of small but meaningful market share gain improvements at retail through the ssi resource and we need to see a much longer streak to feel better about that business but we are pleased to start to see some of the momentum there and as the earlier question alluded to a lot of that comes from the strength of our class b business the move or the shift to smaller motorhomes here in the last probably 12 to 18 months in terms of retail demand certainly positions winnebago in a positive fashion especially around class b products but we ve even spent a lot of time on improving our class c lineup here recently with the introduction of the outlook a year ago and the new version of that being shown here recently at rvx but also the new mercedes sprinter chassis product on our view and navion series being unveiled in salt lake as well so we do intend and are optimistic that we can gain market share for some time in the future i won t put an end date on it we ll work very hard to make sure that lasts as long as possible but it will be driven mostly by towables but now we re starting to see motorhome contribute to that as well which is great steve o hara sidoti and company analyst ok and then maybe just a follow up to that i think in the past you had talked about not having the right product in the market on the motorized side for a number of years prior to maybe the new management team coming on and i m just wondering where you think that process is in terms of having the right product at the right price point and where that stands and then relative to the dealer base has that helped maybe improve the your reception from the dealers and i think there have been a number of dealers that have kind of dropped winnebago brand at some point and more of you seeing them come back to you and maybe where that stands as well thank you michael happe president and chief executive officer yes the winnebago motorhome turnaround continues to be a work in progress and it starts with having a product line that end customers have strong appeal for and dealers that view those products favorably as well and we ll advocate for them on their lots against the other brands that they carry our class b lineup i think is market leading and we will continue to work very hard to make that even stronger the new boldt and travato product we showed at rvx are examples of us not resting on our laurels there as i ve mentioned we ve been working on the class c line as well with the outlook but also now the refreshed and now relaunched view and navion and our class a gas line on the winnebago motorhome side has been repositioned with the intent the vista and the adventurer now positioned well in that line so we re better than where we were several years ago we do have models that are still tired and still need both a refresh we have some new products in the pipeline that we ll unveil in the coming years that we can t speak about right now i would say our opening price point class a diesel product the forza is in good shape and has performed well at retail here in during this fiscal year we need to strengthen our diesel lineup overall as we transition the production and assembly process from oregon to iowa so boy it s tough to come up with a metaphor i guess steve to kind of say exactly where we re at in that journey but i think we re feeling better and better every quarter and that s why you re starting to see both margins improve on a year over year basis but also the market share is starting to stabilize and hopefully turn in a positive direction but we will have roughly 15 market share in that business and candidly i d like to see the market share for that line get to 20 in the future or more and that s a team that a goal that the team that is clearly aware of from my perspective and working hard to that end but that will still take some time steve o hara sidoti and company analyst thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gerrick johnson with bmo capital markets your line is now open gerrick johnson bmo capital markets analyst thank you good morning i have two questions here first when you guys say that wholesale shipments and retail sales equation will approach a new equilibrium what exactly does that mean does that mean retail and wholesale units will be the same or does that mean the percent growth of each will be equal so what precisely does that comment mean thank you michael happe president and chief executive officer thank you gerrick for the question what i mean by that comment is that the pace of dealer inventory destocking will slow and reach a point where dealers are comfortable with the inventory on their lots as it pertains to their turns targets going forward and that will probably vary by category towables and motorhomes and even by subcategories within there but on a macro basis we ll see the destocking of dealer inventory slow to a much more reasonable pace if not to a more stable place so the certainly the math would have to be that retail will continue to have to outpace shipments on a percentage basis over the next several months in order to get there but that s what i mean by that i m probably not in a position here to give you specific numbers but that s the intention of that comment gerrick johnson bmo capital markets analyst no that s great appreciate it very helpful the second question i have is you guys said that in the quarter one time investments were 12 points the 16 increase in sg a and it sounds like that does not include much oregon cost if any and you quantified that oregon cost for third quarter and fourth quarter i guess 0 02 each quarter how about those other onetime ish investments how much more of that will we have in future quarters and for how long bryan hughes vice president and chief financial officer gerrick this is bryan i ll take that one yes so in q2 we continued to have that project alluded to in q1 as an investment we re not going to commit to future quarters in terms of having or not having those types of investments we reserve the right to invest strategically when we see the opportunity to do so i will say that the specific strategic projects that we alluded to in q1 and q2 here is wrapped up effectively so as it relates to that specific item we don t expect cost to be incurred again here in a material way in q3 but like i said we do reserve the right to continue to invest in other items as we see the opportunity gerrick johnson bmo capital markets analyst all right perfect thank you very much bryan hughes vice president and chief financial officer thank you gerrick operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael swartz with suntrust your line is now oepn michael swartz suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey guys good morning michael happe president and chief executive officer morning mike michael swartz suntrust robinson humphrey analyst mike just wanted to maybe flesh out your comments around the retail backdrop for 2019 and i guess correct me if i m wrong but it sounds like down low single digit to down mid single digits is how you re thinking about it now and i think when we talked previously on your first quarter call you were thinking more low single digits it sounds like maybe that got a little worse but on the share gain side i think i remember you saying that you expected to outperform retail by eight to 10 points now you re saying by double digits so it sounds like your share is actually getting better so are those correct and maybe what have you seen in recent weeks that gives you more comfort that that kind of 10 point share gap is the right way to think about it michael happe president and chief executive officer yes thanks mike for the questions i do believe you stated our assumptions well in your question there industry retail has been a little softer in the last couple of months than i think we had projected earlier and our over performance has i think hung in there very well at that double digit over performance rate and so that s really simplistically the genesis for modifying slightly both our industry retail thoughts for 2019 as a calendar year but also i guess our over performance both of those as you would probably agree two points either way or probably within the margin of error as we sit here today but i would hope that retail for calendar year 2019 for the industry is no worse than 5 down and again hopefully closer to lower single digits i m still not quite there myself in terms of being able to project a flat to slightly up retail year i d love to see that but i d still like to see a couple more months of evidence that that can happen but our teams are very focused and whether it s the class b market share gain potential that we think we have but also the momentum of our towables business and specifically the grand design momentum we think we can continue to serve dealers well earn their business satisfy our end customers and we know our competitors are fierce and they will continue to serve their customers as well as they can but i guess you are right those are some of our latest assumptions michael swartz suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok great and then one point of clarification i think you said you lost a number of days due to weather in the second quarter i think specifically february did you quantify how many days that actually was maybe on a year over year basis was it three fewer days or how to think about that michael happe president and chief executive officer i will tell you so mike i ll give you some numbers here but i do want to make sure everybody takes some with a grain of salt because it is hard to sometimes go back and calculate exactly what could or should have happened have you had a stable operating environment but we ve roughly calculated that in the second quarter we lost approximately 10 production days across our various facilities now that s not 10 whole days calendar wise but several facilities were down for the same day and other facilities were down just by themselves but 10 production days several hundreds of units and we believe that had a potential value of 20 million in terms of possible shipments to the market and so you ll notice here i m just a bit tentative and stressing that because we re by no means are we going to use that as a crutch or an excuse because the rest of the industry saw some of that as well in north indiana i will say that the state of iowa and the state of minnesota where we have some our operating facilities was it was an especially harsh winter here and so those are the numbers 10 production days in total and approximately 20 million of potential lost revenue we attribute to weather but we stand by our results and are still pleased with them for q2 michael swartz suntrust robinson humphrey analyst no that s great thanks for that color and then one more and as we think about the inventory situation is there a way you think about it geographically just in terms of how we re progressing in this kind of rebalancing act are there areas where inventory seems to be a little heavier than others or are we across the board kind of in the same position michael happe president and chief executive officer no i would say that geographically the northern part of the country still appears to be lagging in terms of dealer inventory correction meaning they probably have a little bit further ways to go and the southern part of the country is ahead of the north and that would seem to make common sense due to weather and spring coming earlier in the south than it does in the north and that s just from some of our own qualitative feedback but also candidly a number of you analysts do a great job in your own dealer surveys of looking at that inventory on a regional basis and we read those reports as well and get some feedback from our inventory finance partners but i don t want to get into further regional specificity but i would just say the north is a bit behind the south and we expect the north to continue to destock here over the next two or three months for sure as retail starts in this part of the country michael swartz suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok great all for me thank you michael happe president and chief executive officer thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david whiston with morningstar your line is now open david whiston morningstar analyst kind of following up on the last question in terms of dealers have been going through a pretty sounds like pretty significant rightsizing process just now that they re at least in the south maybe toward the end of that do you think your dealers nationwide are relatively optimistic going to the spring selling season and will incentives slow or do you think they re still pretty uneasy about the macro situation michael happe president and chief executive officer well i think it s in some ways it s a mix of both i don t think any rv dealers are predicting that the sky is falling and that there s going to be a massive retail correction here in calendar year 2019 i think it depends on the strength of the dealer the lines that they carry their competitive position in their various markets that they may have a presence in so my general dealer view is that especially coming off rvx in salt lake city that they are optimistic that they can have a solid retail season they are seeing good foot traffic at some of their retail shows the marine and rv industries are both noting however a more difficult environment to close sales specific to retail shows in some cases but also when customers are on their lots and i think that is due to a number of factors that i mentioned earlier in the formal comments but just a general anxiety of kind of where the economic conditions are but again i think your strong dealers continue to get stronger and your dealers that don t have as good of a competitive position are probably more pessimistic and again i think it depends on the lines they carry and i know dealers that for example carry grand design are very bullish about their retail prospects in many ways because of the grand design presence on their lots and so and we re glad that that s the case but david whiston morningstar analyst ok thanks and on free cash flow generation in the second half of fiscal 19 first half really benefited from the inventory reduction on working capital do you think second half is going to still be robust even if there s an inventory tailwind bryan hughes vice president and chief financial officer yes dave this is bryan we do feel good about second half cash flow generation we ve got a lot of working capital initiatives under way at the moment and working capital as you can appreciate is always a challenge to manage as the market is shifting down or as we re seeing headwinds on the wholesale shipments so we ve been struggling with managing it overall in the first half of the year as i m sure our peers are as well because you have to get ahead of that sales downturn but we do expect with the initiatives we have under way to manage it well in the second half and that is our current expectation david whiston morningstar analyst thanks bryan hughes vice president and chief financial officer thank you david operator thank you our next question comes from the line of greg badishkanian with citigroup your line is now open fred wightman citi analyst hey guys it s actually fred wightman on for greg just a quick clarification last quarter you would talk about dealer inventory concerns lessening each month and has that pattern continued since then michael happe president and chief executive officer yes i would say for our business we had always maintained fred that our business was probably late in the cycle in terms of dealer destocking and that our brands were being impacted a little bit later than some of the other brands in the industry q2 definitely showed some headwinds in terms of dealers taking more inventory of our brands and i think you saw that on some of our top line softness i would tell you that our inventories continue to drop on a year over year basis from end of q1 to end of q2 they re in getting in i guess better shape as it pertains to position for future retail in terms of turns our winnebago motorhome inventory has always been in a relatively good shape i would tell you i think that s more a function of the strength of the product line but also the motorhome space being a little softer here in recent months as an industry in several spots so we are we continue to feel good about our field inventory we ve watched the aging very carefully the turns we have some spots that we are focused on working down there are some dealers that we are working with selectively and we always have an aspiration to drive our field inventory turns higher and we look to do that here as well in the next year or two so not much of a change in terms of macro thoughts but our inventory position continues to improve on our brands as well fred wightman citi analyst perfect and then just from a wholesale perspective the rvia data for february down sort of mid teens on an overall basis so down year over year but not as much as last month i mean is that sort of consistent with what you guys saw from a cadence perspective i mean should we really be thinking that you ve seen the low point in terms of year over year declines just at an industry level then it will sort of continue to approach being more aligned similar to what you re saying into the late spring early summer michael happe president and chief executive officer yes i would hope that would certainly be the case i would need to have to go back fred and look at the numbers here for the next couple of months a bit more closely but i would hope that most of your significant shipment declines on a year over year basis i would hope many of those are behind us and you start to see those numbers improve now i don t think they ll turn positive here anytime in the next couple of months but at an industry level but i would think that our chances for seeing better negative shipment conditions will improve here over the next several months so but we ll have to see we are still only 10 of the north american rv industry 90 of the rv industry is in the hands of some other players we ll work to make our number larger and their numbers smaller but the rest of the industry is really still driving a lot of the shipment and the inventory pacing fred wightman citi analyst sure and then just finally from a if we do see retail pickup in april and may how confident are you guys that you can meet that demand from a wholesale perspective michael happe president and chief executive officer i would say we re very confident that we can turn things back on some of it depends on how quickly that you can ramp back up the supply chain but we have good relationships with almost all of our suppliers certainly and we are not running anywhere near full production in most of our plants at this time with the exception i would say of the class b line that s probably the one production plant that continues to produce at a strong rate but and we still have more capacity there as well so i think we can respond it will depend probably series by series line by line and in some cases supplier by supplier but we are not talking about capacity constraints a lot in our business anymore we ve done a lot of investing in the towable segment to address those we ve done a number of projects on the efficiency side in north iowa around the motorhome business we ve identified some new space in north iowa for the diesel line and i would tell you that the place where we re having capacity discussions going forward is really around our chris craft business because that is continuing to exceed the expectations that we had in our m a model and we bought that business thinking that we could grow it significantly and still maintain the luxury brand integrity that it has in the space and those are our latest capacity expansion discussions around that particular branded business fred wightman citi analyst great thank you michael happe president and chief executive officer thank you fred operator thank you we have no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to steve stuber for any further remarks steve stuber director financial planning analysis and investor relations great thank you everyone for joining our call today we certainly appreciate your time and look forward to speaking with many of you throughout the quarter have a great day and thanks again

by anne o krueger washington dc us president donald trump s trade war with china has been slogging along for more than a year now and could escalate further if current talks do not lead to a deal but in the meantime the trump administration has also accused two longstanding us partners turkey and india of benefitting unfairly from the us generalised system of preferences for developing countries having already erected trade barriers against turkey last year the us will now revoke the preferential treatment afforded to certain turkish and indian imports under the programme according to the us trade representative india has implemented a wide array of trade barriers that create serious negative effects on united states commerce in fact it is an insult to suggest that us industry cannot compete with lower productivity firms in a lower income country india s per capita gdp at around 1 900 in 2010 dollars is one quarter that of china and less than one twentieth that of the us and that is a vast improvement on previous decades when india like most developing countries was abjectly poor with an extremely low literacy rate abysmal infrastructure and a weak health system in 1960 the country s per capita gdp was a mere 304 after india s independence in 1947 its first government under prime minister jawaharlal nehru made economic development a top priority and based its policies on the belief that indian producers could not possibly compete with those in advanced economies accordingly india prohibited imports of goods that could be produced domestically and imposed high tariffs and quantitative restrictions on many other imports it was not alone during the decades after world war ii most other developing countries including china and turkey did the same while also establishing or expanding significantly the role of state owned enterprises soes and limiting or prohibiting that of private companies yet by the 1990s china india turkey and many other developing countries had all experienced decades of disappointing growth with trade protectionism having clearly impaired their competitiveness and overall economic performance they removed almost all of their quantitative restrictions and began lowering tariffs substantially at the same time many countries moved to more realistic exchange rates adopted policies to control inflation and relaxed or eliminated controls on private enterprises while reducing the role of soes in their economies the results ranged from good to spectacular for example in the three decades following south korea s adoption of an outward oriented trade strategy in the early 1960s real inflation adjusted wages there rose sevenfold the south koreans had moved to a realistic exchange rate allowed exporters to import intermediate inputs duty and license free lowered tariffs and kept inflation under control likewise china s growth started accelerating soon after it introduced market friendly economic reforms in the early 1980s as did india s following its reforms in the early 1990s lastly turkey despite being an oil importer experienced the highest growth rate in the world in the late 1980s following its removal of protectionist policies earlier that decade in all of these cases the lesson was learned open trade accompanied by appropriate domestic policies is good for growth there are a number of reasons for this whereas competition and the opportunity to learn from others make domestic producers more efficient and innovative high protectionist trade barriers can result in sclerotic monopolies moreover world markets enable economies of scale in production and provide exporters with the precise amount and type of inputs they need and precisely when they need them at the lowest price all told countries that have pursued greater economic openness have enjoyed improved nutritional health and educational outcomes as well as higher productivity and incomes and those that have not namely russia north korea and some countries in africa have fared poorly for an outward oriented strategy to be successful politicians must refrain from over regulating the economy and private economic activities should take place on a level playing field if a large country like china intervenes in ways that affect the world market such as by subsidising steel production a multilateral response is the best policy in an interconnected global economy all countries must work together the trump administration disagrees but its complaints about unfair tariffs elsewhere are hard to take seriously given that the us is raising its own trade barriers if history is any guide the current us approach to trade will result in deteriorating us economic performance because it implies that yesterday s industries will be coddled while the industries of tomorrow will be starved of investment the great irony is that if china india and other developing countries continue to remove protectionist barriers and create a level playing field they will grow stronger and more competitive vis √† vis the us as a democracy with a rapidly growing economy india should be a natural friend for america not least in its efforts to contain china the trump administration s decision to pick on the country thus makes no sense indeed behind all of trump s trade moves is a perverse bargain the us is essentially threatening to harm its own economy unless other countries abolish their protectionist policies and become more competitive but if the goal is to protect us producers from foreign competition the administration should be doing exactly the opposite encouraging developing economies to increase their reliance on inefficient soes protecting against foreign competition and allowing political interference in the economy that together with higher investment in basic research education and infrastructure would ensure america s global economic primacy for decades to come anne o krueger a former world bank chief

a lot of attention and ink are being poured these days in trying to explain to a generation of voters why socialism always fails not only does socialism always fail to deliver the economic goods it is also a source of massive oppression and pain i get why so many are devoting such amounts of energy to this task first the likes of senator bernie sanders and representative alexandria ocasio cortez and a few others have made the notion of socialism acceptable in some circles and even hip also according to a poll from august for the first time since gallup has asked the question more democrats approve of socialism than of capitalism however if all we do is talk about how venezuela is a hellhole and cuba is a terrible place i fear that we might end up being the modern equivalent of don quixote fighting the windmill the cuban model there is a ton of work still to do to help younger americans understand how venezuela and cuba ended up being such horrible places in some cases we even have to explain that yes indeed these are horrible places until venezuela was in the news on a regular basis because of the approach of its people toward starvation as well as the expropriation and daily tyranny from the chavez maduro regime there were plenty of intellectuals praising the system and let s not forget the praises or lack of condemnation for the oppressive regime that is cuba coming from many world leaders after fidel castro finally died so yes there is a lot of work to be done however if that s all we do in response to aoc and sanders promising americans that a socialist regime will produce a world where everyone works less earns more gets free healthcare and schooling and receives generous subsidies from the government even when one decides not to work no one tempted by socialism will listen the swedish model that s because when sanders and his ilk talk about socialism they aren t talking about expropriating property rights nationalizing all businesses or eliminating all but one the state s television channel they aren t talking about venezuela or cuba instead they are talking about denmark and sweden it is true that sanders and his people fail to understand that socialism exists on a spectrum on one side you have the dictatorships while on the other side you have the social democracies both sides of the spectrum use oppression and compulsory taxation to achieve their goals but the degree to which they do so varies a great deal this variation in socialist methods gives rise also to variation in the legitimacy of different degrees of socialism no one seriously ever thinks of french president emmanuel macron as a despot even though his own people happen to call him tyrannical on a regular basis in spite of the gigantic size of the french state and the enormous amount of taxes extracted by the regime one side allows elections the other side either forbids them or makes a mockery of the concept all varieties of socialism fail to achieve their goals for the same reason all varieties attempt to one degree or another to substitute the decisions of government planners for those of private citizens interacting in competitive markets yet it is also true that all varieties of socialism fail to achieve their goals for the same reason all varieties attempt to one degree or another to substitute the decisions of government planners for those of private citizens interacting in competitive markets and in doing so all varieties of socialism suffer from the insurmountable knowledge problem as beautifully demonstrated by the late economist don lavoie in his book 1985 book national economic planning what is left that said there is still a vast difference between venezuela and denmark in terms of how much of the economy planners try to control and as a result how much of the economy planners destroy i worry that if we keep talking as if today s american democrats envision controls as extensive as exist in venezuela those of us who warn of the dangers that lurk in the schemes of sanders and aoc won t get through the french model in addition to this difficulty is the fact that while they claim that they are talking about nordic countries what sanders and aoc actually have in mind is a regime more like that of france when sweden and denmark each had in place a regime closer to what sanders is talking about the results were so bad that each of these countries put in place pretty dramatic free market reforms these two countries are by no means libertarian paradises but thanks to large spending cuts and lower taxes they aren t the hot mess that they once were france is though such a mess that s because there is one aspect in particular that the aocs and sanders of the world fail to mention to their followers when they talk about their socialist dream all of the goodies that they believe the american people are entitled to receive in fact come at a great cost and so the only way to pay for these goodies is with oppressive and regressive taxes i e taxes heaped on to the backs of the middle class and the poor france was once a role model for what big government can do for its people but it has become an embarrassing example since the gilets jaunes took to the streets to demonstrate against the insane amount of taxes they pay these guys aren t upper class they are the people who have until now supported the policies that are inevitable when you have the government providing so many services and involved so deeply in so much of the economy talking about taxes the wsj had a good summary of the situation the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released its annual revenue statistics report this week and france topped the charts with a tax take equal to 46 2 of gdp in 2017 that s more than denmark 46 sweden 44 and germany 37 5 and far more than the oecd average 34 2 or the u s 27 1 which includes all levels of government france doesn t collect that revenue in the ways you might think despite the stereotype of heavy european income taxes on the rich paris relies disproportionately on social insurance payroll and property taxes social taxes account for 37 of french revenue the oecd average is 26 payroll and property taxes contribute 3 and 9 compared to the oecd averages of 1 and 6 as a reminder the payroll tax is very regressive it consumes a larger share of low and middle class earners than rich people in addition then europe adds a regressive consumption tax the value added tax in france vat and other consumption taxes make up 24 of revenue and that s on the low side compared to an oecd average of 33 consumption taxes often fall hardest on the poor and middle class who devote a greater proportion of their income to consumption to be sure the spending is also more regressive in france in that the biggest share goes to the middle and low income earners but it is a stupid system in which you tax one group to redistribute to that same group add one more increase to an already high and regressive gas tax in france to the existing 214 taxes and duties and the people went nuts they have been protesting continuously since november 17th 2018 i don t condone the violence but i understand why the protestors are so furious regimentation in labor their anger is further fueled by the very rigid labor market france has all sorts of labor regulations on the books some preventing firms from firing workers and hence creating a disincentive to hire workers in the first place other regulations such as the minimum wage make the cost of employing people so high that employers don t employ people it is also not surprising that so many fast food restaurants in france have replaced employees with robots like other countries the french also have all sorts of generous family friendly laws that end up backfiring and penalizing female employment the french government is also very generous to those people who don t work all of these policies make the lives of lower and middle class people harder unemployment is high 24 5 percent for young french people and economic growth has been anemic for decades all those people in america who currently fall for the socialism soup that aoc and sanders are selling need to realize that if their dream came to pass they not the rich not the bankers and politicians will be ones suffering the most the bottom line is this all those people in america who currently fall for the socialism soup that aoc and sanders are selling need to realize that if their dream came to pass they not the rich not the bankers and politicians will be ones suffering the most from the high taxes high unemployment and slow growth that go hand in hand with the level of public spending they want everyone would suffer of course but those who will be screwed the most are definitely those at the bottom this article was reprinted from the american institute for economic

as alarm bells sound over the advancing destruction of the environment a variety of green new deal proposals have appeared in the u s and europe along with some interesting academic debates about how to fund them monetary policy normally relegated to obscure academic tomes and bureaucratic meetings behind closed doors has suddenly taken center stage the 14 page proposal for a green new deal submitted to the u s house of representatives by congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez does not actually mention modern monetary theory but that is the approach currently capturing the attention of the media and taking most of the heat the concept is good abundance can be ours without worrying about taxes or debt at least until we hit full productive capacity but the devil is in the details mmt advocates say the government does not need to collect taxes before it spends it actually creates new money in the process of spending it and there is plenty of room in the economy for public spending before demand outstrips supply driving up prices critics however say this is not true the government is not allowed to spend before it has the money in its account and the money must come from tax revenues or bond sales in a 2013 treatise called modern monetary theory 101 a reply to critics mmt academics actually concede this point but they write that these constraints do not change the end result and here the argument gets a bit technical their reasoning is that the fed is the monopoly supplier of cb currency treasury spends by using cb currency and since the treasury obtained cb currency by taxing and issuing treasuries cb currency must be injected before taxes and bond offerings can occur the counterargument made by american monetary institute researchers among others is that the central bank is not the monopoly supplier of dollars the vast majority of the dollars circulating in the united states are created not by the government but by private banks when they make loans the fed accommodates this process by supplying central bank currency bank reserves as needed and this bank created money can be taxed or borrowed by the treasury before a single dollar is spent by congress the ami researchers contend all bank reserves are originally created by the fed for banks government expenditure merely transfers previous bank reserves back to banks as the federal reserve bank of st louis puts it federal deficits do not require that the federal reserve purchase more government securities therefore federal deficits per se need not lead to increases in bank reserves or the money supply what federal deficits do increase is the federal debt and while the debt itself can be rolled over from year to year as it virtually always is the exponentially growing interest tab is one of those mandatory budget items that taxpayers must pay predictions are that in the next decade interest alone could add 1 trillion to the annual bill an unsustainable tax burden to fund a project as massive as the green new deal we need a mechanism that involves neither raising taxes nor adding to the federal debt and such a mechanism is actually proposed in the u s green new deal a network of public banks while little discussed in the u s media that alternative is being debated in europe where green new deal proposals have been on the table since 2008 european economists have had more time to think these initiatives through and they are less hampered by labels like socialist and capitalist which have long been integrated into their multiparty systems a decade of gestation in europe the first green new deal proposal was published in 2008 by the new economics foundation on behalf of the green new deal group in the uk the latest debate is between proponents of the democracy in europe movement 2025 diem25 led by former greek finance minister yanis varoufakis and french economist thomas piketty author of the best selling capital in the 21st century piketty recommends funding a european green new deal by raising taxes while varoufakis favors a system of public green banks varoufakis explains that europe needs a new source of investment money that does not involve higher taxes or government deficits diem25 proposes for this purpose an investment led recovery or new deal program to be financed via public bonds issued by europe s public investment banks e g the new investment vehicle foreshadowed in countries like britain the european investment bank and the european investment fund in the european union etc to ensure that these bonds do not lose their value the central banks would stand ready to buy them above a certain yield in summary diem25 is proposing a re calibrated real green investment version of quantitative easing that utilises the central bank public development banks already have a successful track record in europe and their debts are not considered debts of the government they are financed not through taxes but by the borrowers when they repay the loans like other banks development banks are moneymaking institutions that not only don t cost the government money but actually generate a profit for it diem25 collaborator stuart holland observes while piketty is concerned to highlight differences between his proposals and those for a green new deal the real difference between them is that his however well intentioned are a wish list for a new treaty a new institution and taxation of wealth and income a green new deal needs neither treaty revisions nor new institutions and would generate both income and direct and indirect taxation from a recovery of employment it is grounded in the precedent of the success of the bond funded roosevelt new deal which from 1933 to 1941 reduced unemployment from over a fifth to less than a tenth with an average annual fiscal deficit of only 3 percent roosevelt s new deal was largely funded through the reconstruction finance corporation rfc a public financial institution set up earlier by president hoover its funding source was the sale of bonds but proceeds from the loans repaid the bonds leaving the rfc with a net profit the rfc financed roads bridges dams post offices universities electrical power mortgages farms and much more and it funded all this while generating income for the government a system of public banks and green qe the u s green new deal envisions funding with a combination of the federal reserve a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks which could include banks owned locally by cities and states as sylvia chi chair of the legislative committee of the california public banking alliance explains on medium com the green new deal relies on a network of public banks like a decentralized version of the rfc as part of the plan to help finance the contemplated public investments this approach has worked in germany where public banks have been integral in financing renewable energy installations and energy efficiency retrofits local or regional public banks says chi could help pay for the green new deal by making low interest loans for building and upgrading infrastructure deploying clean energy resources transforming our food and transportation systems to be more sustainable and accessible and other projects the federal government can help by for example capitalizing public banks setting environmental or social responsibility standards for loan programs or tying tax incentives to participating in public bank loans uk professor richard murphy adds another role for the central bank as the issuer of new money in the form of green infrastructure quantitative easing murphy who was a member of the original 2008 uk green new deal group explains all qe works by the buying debt issued by the government or other bodies using money that it quite literally creates out of thin air his money creation process is what happens every time a bank makes a loan all that is unusual is that we are suggesting that the funds created by the using this process be used to buy back debt that is due by the government in one of its many forms meaning that it is effectively canceled the invariable objection to that solution is that it would act as an inflationary force driving up prices but as argued in my earlier article here this need not be the case there is a chronic gap between debt and the money available to repay it that actually needs to be filled with new money every year to avoid a balance sheet recession as uk prof mary mellor formulates the problem in debt or democracy 2016 page 42 a major contradiction of tying money supply to debt is that the creators of the money always want more money back than they have issued debt based money must be continually repaid with interest as money is continually being repaid new debt must be being generated if the money supply is to be maintained this builds a growth dynamic into the money supply that would frustrate the aims of those who seek to achieve a more socially and ecologically sustainable economy in addition to interest says mellor there is the problem that bankers and other rich people generally do not return their profits to local economies unlike public banks which must use their profits for local needs the wealthy hoard their money invest it in the speculative markets hide it in offshore tax havens or send it abroad to avoid the cyclical booms and busts that have routinely devastated the u s economy this missing money needs to be replaced and if the new money is used to pay down debt it will be extinguished along with the debt leaving the overall money supply and the inflation rate unchanged if too much money is added to the economy it can always be taxed back but as mmters note we are a long way from the full productive capacity that would overheat the economy today murphy writes of his green qe proposal the qe program that was put in place between 2009 and 2012 had just one central purpose which was to refinance the city of london and its banks what we are suggesting is a smaller programme to kickstart the uk economy by investing in all those things that we would wish our children to inherit whilst creating the opportunities for everyone in every city town village and hamlet in the uk to undertake meaningful and appropriately paid work a network of public banks including a central bank operated as a public utility could similarly fund a u s green new deal without raising taxes driving up the federal debt or inflating prices before you go

airbus is considering whether or not to shift the assembly process of its latest generation of a330 planes to china as part of a bid to increase its market share in the world s fastest growing civil aviation market the european multinational is following a trend started by boeing which recently opened a new completion plant in china on the face of it the decision by the two companies which dominate the civilian aviation market makes sense build where your biggest customer lives especially as china does not yet have a fully home grown civil aviation industry ready to compete globally the benefits are many including the goodwill and esteem of the country that would be buying these planes in the long term however that might prove to be a costly miscalculation based on its recent history here and here it won t take long for china to catch up and largely displace both companies domestically in beijing s home aviation market as well as seizing a large chunk of the corporate duopoly s global market share airbus and boeing could therefore be making short term decisions with negative long term consequences for their future profitability given china s formidable economic advancement none of this should come as a surprise to either airbus or boeing nor should it shock western governments the problem is that everybody has historically been guided by the na√Øve assumption that simply admitting china to organizations such as the world trade organization wto would induce beijing to in the words of philip pan eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring china into the fold of democratic nations or the chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot china has many aims and goals that are antithetical to the long term prosperity of western companies and economies china has unquestionably modernized but its politically illiberal dirigiste polity has if anything massively moved in the opposite direction strengthened by that very modernization process that has done anything but falter furthermore the country has many aims and goals that are antithetical to the long term prosperity of western companies and economies as the european union is beginning to recognize boeing and airbus might simply become the latest western sacrificial lambs beijing has explicitly targeted wide bodied aircraft as one of its 10 new priority sectors for import substitution in its made in china 2025 document so whatever short term gains airbus and boeing receive in terms of securing additional orders from china could well be undermined longer term the resultant technology transfers and lower labor costs will almost certainly give beijing a quantum leap toward competing directly and ultimately displacing both companies given the merger with mcdonnell douglas boeing will continue its march toward in effect becoming a branch of the us department of defense as its civilian market share crashes but airbus doesn t really have the luxury of a military alternative given the relative paucity of european defense expenditures as if boeing needed any further problems the 737 fiasco represents the latest in a series of setbacks for the company boeing s 737 global recall coming on the heels of the initial launch problems of the 787 dreamliner some six years ago where the demoduralization of production meant that boeing could not fully account for stress transmission and loading at the system level as gary pisano and willy shih write together illustrate the dangers of spreading manufacturing too far across the globe engineers notes city university of new york fellow jon rynn need to kick the tires of the new production processes they design so while a market may be global production and the growth of production take place most efficiently in relatively close geographic quarters american companies such as boeing consistently underestimate the value of closely integrating research and devlopment and manufacturing while underplaying the risks of separating them as recent events have demonstrated again to the company s cost by deciding to expand its a330 production in china airbus looks poised to repeat boeing s error a potential miscalculation that most european union companies have hitherto largely avoided because the eu has prioritized domestic manufacturing discouraged offshoring more than its us counterparts in regard to the loss of us manufacturing jobs attributable to china the american economic review paper by justin r pierce and peter k schott specifically notes that there was no similar reaction in the european union where policy did not change beijing itself has historically balanced its purchases from both major civil aviation manufacturers to ensure that it does not rely too heavily on one aircraft supplier which means that airbus will likely benefit from the void created by the 737 recall all the more reason why the european conglomerate should be wary of following the pied piper like expansion into china the 737 recall also complicates resolution of the us china trade conflict which had appeared closer to resolution in light of beijing s proposal to buy an additional us 1 2 trillion in us exports over six years boeing aircraft purchases featured heavily on beijing s shopping list the longer term challenges relate to china s economic development path and its corresponding move up the high tech curve which have largely been characterized by mercantilist policies of protection and heavy government subsidy but the longer term challenges relate to china s economic development path and its corresponding move up the high tech curve which have largely been characterized by mercantilist policies of protection and heavy government subsidy in this regard the chinese state has followed a national development strategy first outlined in the mid 19th century by german economist friedrich list who argued that the national government should play a crucial role in promoting guiding and regulating the process of national economic advancement protectionism list argued should play a role here as well during the country s catch up phase of technological development list wrote the analysis against a historic backdrop where germany was beginning to challenge the dominant economic power of its time the united kingdom so the defenders of beijing might well point to his work to show that there is nothing new about using the state as a principal instrument to accelerate economic development and innovation however list was analyzing two capitalist economies operating within the context of a 19th century gold standard global financial system which invariably circumscribed the scope of state involvement the finite availability of gold reserves limiting fiscal policy options by contrast today the global economy operates under a fiat currency system and what therefore distinguishes china s economic domestic development from its 19th century predecessors is the sheer scale of fiscal resources it can deploy in the furtherance of its economic and military objectives some of these objectives might not be so benign to the west longer term which points to another consideration for the west for all of its supposed embrace of capitalism china is still primarily a state dominated economy which eschews the disciplines of a free market economy this means it has the capacity and ideological predisposition to use the national fiscal policy as a loss leader absorbing losses well beyond what would be tolerated in an economy dominated by private enterprise private companies of course can go bust beijing underwrites its designated national champions by relying on a combination of subsidies some disguised as they flow through state backed investment funds and the financial sectors and buy china preferences to develop chinese products even though these policies are contrary to the rules of wto membership which china eagerly joined in 2001 as economist brad setser argues various parts of the chinese state compete absorb losses and then consolidate around the successful firms other countries worry about the losses notes setser but not the chinese government which simply socializes the losses at the national level and writes them off in this regard boeing and airbus would do well to consider china s experience in the solar industry designating this as another strategic sector for growth in the 1990s chinese solar companies with the explicit backstop of the state ultimately raised enough funding via debt to build sufficient solar capacity for the world three times over the overinvestment ultimately killed the cash flows of major western competitors and knocked them out of the business leaving the market free for china to dominate commenting on the trend scientific american highlighted that between 2008 and 2013 china s fledgling solar electric panel industry dropped world prices by 80 percent a stunning achievement in a fiercely competitive high tech market china had leapfrogged from nursing a tiny rural oriented solar program in the 1990s to become the globe s leader in what may soon be the world s largest renewable energy source here was a classic case of state guided supported commercial companies receiving benefits that went far beyond anything in say south korea or taiwan or even japan in the earlier part of their development now this trend is manifesting itself across the entire spectrum of the chinese guided economy including agricultural equipment industrial machinery telecommunications artificial intelligence computer chips and civil aviation in another disturbing parallel that boeing and airbus would do well to consider the timeline of china s rise began in the late 1990s when germany overwhelmed by the domestic response to a government incentive program to promote rooftop solar panels provided the capital technology and experts to lure china into making solar panels to meet the german demand according to scientific american much like the german solar companies which shipped valuable manufacturing and technological expertise to china to sustain demand boeing and airbus could well be signing their economic death warrants by agreeing to offshore increasing amounts of production in china to sustain their global market shares aided and abetted by their more market oriented governments which frown on the idea of national industrial policy the same thing is happening in wind power in china which is expected to see offshore wind capacity grow from 2 gigawatts last year to 31gw in the next decade china s expansion here has already forced siemens and gamesa to merge to cope with the rising competitive challenge as far as aviation itself goes setser makes the point that china may cut into the united states future exports by building its own competitor to the 737 and also cut into europe s future exports if airbus decides to build the a330 in china and china buys made in china rolls royce engines for the c929 and the a330 even if this allows the duopoly to maintain its dominance in global civil aviation it is hard to see how shifting manufacturing production of aircraft components to china to get orders constitutes a win for the us or european workers who are already being displaced and boeing s weak kneed response to the 737 crisis will likely exacerbate the company s problems going forward the bottom line is that both western governments and western corporations have persistently underestimated the power of china s economic development model and the corresponding economic threat that it poses to the west s own affluence the usual criticism leveled against the chinese growth model is that a country that subsidizes its industries ends up with inefficient industries because heavily protected local firms are shielded from global competition ultimately leaving the country that resorts to protectionism with inferior products the idea of national champions built up via state dirigisme according to classic liberal economic doctrine ultimately ensures that economic efficiency and commercial considerations get squeezed out rent seeking and corruption become institutionalized goes the argument so these national champions ultimately will not be able to compete in the global marketplace that was certainly the assumption of milton friedman who called the communist party of china s state driven strategy an open invitation to corruption and inefficiency by contrast according to defense and the national interest the governing assumptions of capitalist economies is that the discipline of the marketplace not the state is better suited to choose winners and knock out losers who cannot offer the prices or quality or features of their competitors china represents the ultimate repudiation of these seemingly ironclad economic laws the country s success has come across a slew of industries clean tech notably wind and solar power internet companies despite overwhelming censorship china has corporate behemoths such as alibaba or baidu that rival google in scale and scope and more recently in the telecommunications sector where huawei has clearly benefited from buy china preferences created by the state via its state owned telecommunications enterprises and now is considered to be the global leader in 5g telephony in practice therefore there is no reason the same model cannot work with regard to civil aviation even as airbus and boeing eagerly provide the rope with which they may hang their respective companies in the future this article was produced by economy for all a

the reserve bank of new zealand came close to cutting rates when it delivered last month s monetary policy statement according to uk based economist andrew hunt the central bank knows new zealand is exposed to the global slowdown particularly to a slowdown in china and new zealand s banks are dependent on offshore wholesale funding hunt told an investment conference in wellington organised by nikko asset management concerns about liquidity in wholesale interest rate markets globally is one of the reasons the reserve bank is proposing to nearly double banks minimum tier 1 capital to ready the banks to withstand a one in 200 year catastrophe hunt says since the gfc the amount new zealand banks need to borrow from offshore has fallen from about 40 percent of their assets to about 25 percent and has shifted from short term borrowing to significantly longer terms hunt says that since regulators in the united states and japan have acted to stop banks from lending in emerging markets the world has gone from a glut of credit to a shortage the world is already in a trade and industrial production recession as a result of that credit squeeze he argues and asian nations have returned to exporting deflation given about a third of us goods are manufactured in asia that s likely to decrease inflation in the us by about 100 basis points and will offset the inflationary impact of rising wages in the us hunt says after the passage of president donald trump s us 1 5 trillion tax package in late 2017 which included incentives for us companies to repatriate capital only about a dozen us companies bothered to bring money back from offshore he says the outcome of the mid term us elections last november which resulted in control of the house of representatives shifting from the republican party to the democratic party was a wake up call for companies which hadn t gotten around to repatriating capital they realised the incentives might not always be available within 10 days of those elections us corporates repatriated us 220 billion flooding us markets with cash during the government shutdown and until very recently hunt says with about us 750 800 billion of treasuries set to be issued in april and may there are questions about who will buy them given three month yields are now higher than on 10 year treasuries he says the three month treasury bills were quoted recently at 2 4527 percent while 10 year treasury bonds were at 2 439 percent while the industrial sector in china was beset by a credit crunch through 2018 china s households were saving less and spending more but now the wider economy in china is feeling a credit crunch and its economic growth is slowing hunt says growth is likely to drop to about 3 percent this year that would be down from 6 6 percent in 2018 which was already the slowest pace in 28 years growth is also slowing in japan and europe and all this means the imf forecast of 3 percent world growth in 2019 is a joke hunt says all these events have fed into the reserve bank of new zealand s calculations and hunt says the central bank will sacrifice the new zealand dollar by cutting interest rates to ensure nominal gdp growth if you re a small open economy the easiest way to maintain gdp growth is through your currency if your terms of trade remain quite consistent it works very well he says businessdesk comments from our readers no comments yet add your comment your name your email not displayed to the public comment comments to sharechat go through an approval process comments which are defamatory abusive or in some way deemed inappropriate will not be approved it is allowable to use some form of non de plume for your name however we recommend real email addresses are used comments from free email addresses such as gmail yahoo hotmail etc may not be approved anti spam verification type the text you see in the image into the field below you are asked to do this in order to verify that this enquiry is not being performed by an automated process related news hgh meets challenger bank milestone nz 210m equity raise april 8th morning report being ai limited trade with caution statement fletcher building executive team announcement manawa energy appoints gm market operations gm people april 5th morning report paysauce quarterly market update march 2024 april 3rd morning report bank of china new zealand limited director change ccc appointment of ceo aiden keegan

san antonio icis the chemical industry is starting one of its biggest conferences at a time of continued worries about economic growth public backlash again plastic waste and increased interest in turning larger amounts of oil into chemicals it s a lot to contemplate during the international petrochemical conference ipc which starts on sunday at this point in the year companies expected that the industry would be showing signs of recovering from the slowdown in demand that took place in the fourth quarter that slowdown has several causes rising interest rates made automobiles and housing more expensive to finance causing sales to fall growth in europe started to slow china attempted to rein in debt which tightened lending and slowed growth the tariffs resulting from its trade dispute with the us aggravated the downturn concerns about global demand led to a sharp decline in oil prices during such steep drops petrochemical buyers typically delay purchases and rely on their inventories to meet their needs in a phenomenon called destocking this caused demand for petrochemicals to fall companies acknowledged all of this during their q4 earnings calls and said the factors were in place for chemical demand to recover a sentiment repeated by an economist at a recent conference european monetary policy remains loose which should stimulate demand china has changed course on its campaign to reverse interest rates and has introduced a multi pronged stimulus programme that lowered bank reserve requirements and taxes the federal reserve has halted its campaign to raise interest rates in the us few economists expect a recession this year although the chances increase substantially in 2020 and even more so in 2021 despite this relative optimism for 2019 signs point to more trouble us listed shares of chemical companies fell sharply on friday and they have lagged behind the recovery in the overall stock market this year the slowdown could be worse than expected the yields on 3 month and 10 year us treasurys inverted for the first time since 2007 inverted yield curves often preclude a recession by several months among chemical companies us based huntsman expects q1 adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda to be 10 lower versus q4 2018 on weaker construction and auto markets in the us as well as softer demand patterns in most large european economies us based eastman chemical on 15 march announced a modest and targeted reduction in its workforce and a delay in salary increases for most employees on a weakening outlook specifically in china and europe in addition to a shaky recovery the industry will also face growing public backlash against plastic waste plastics consumption has increased sharply in emerging economies which often lack the capacity to collect waste plastic packaging end up in mountains of waste or in rivers that feed oceans graphic photographs of plastic waste have created backlash against plastics around the world leading to regulations that restrict or ban plastic straws bags and other items that are used one time before being discarded trade groups and other non governmental organisations are setting goals to adopt increasing amounts of recycled material in plastics chemical companies have a legitimate concern that regulations and sentiment could reduce or even wipe out demand for many applications worries about bisphenol a bpa leaking into food and beverages led to companies to find replacements phthalate based plasticizers were replaced in toys in the us methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe was replaced by other octane boosters in gasoline chemical companies and trade group have spent much of the past year talking about sustainability their industry s role in achieving it and what they can do to reduce waste the american chemistry council acc has its own goal calling for all plastic packaging to be reused recycled or recovered by 2040 plastic producers have teamed up with converters consumer group and waste management firms to create the alliance to end plastic waste aepw just as downstream plastic markets are changing because of sustainability the chemical industry could see shifts in upstream production as well oil companies are considering whether they should convert a larger share of their crude into petrochemicals refineries already produce petrochemicals catalytic reforming units convert naphtha into benzene toluene and xylenes btx these aromatics can be blended into gasoline sold as solvents or used to make other petrochemicals fluid catalytic cracking fcc units convert gasoil into gasoline and refinery grade propylene rgp these older technologies could be revamped to produce even larger amounts of petrochemicals companies are considering units that could convert other refining streams into petrochemicals saudi aramco is even developing new technology that could convert a larger portion of a barrel of oil into chemicals petrochemicals are attractive to refiners because demand is growing at faster rates than fuel if policy makers become more aggressive about restricting greenhouse gas emissions then growth in fuel demand could be even slower new technology could make electric vehicles more affordable than gasoline fueled automobiles regardless of any government incentives or subsidies petrochemicals could provide oil companies with a hedge in the event that fuel demand falls below expectations it is unclear whether it will be an adequate hedge petrochemical markets are orders of magnitude smaller than fuel markets demand for ethylene and propylene derivatives is growing faster than chemicals derived from oil based feedstock such as aromatics companies are producing these olefins with gas feedstock via ethane crackers and propane dehydrogenation pdh units the backlash against plastic waste could extend to greenhouse gas emissions and the oil industry this would also make refineries a less attractive hedge oil to chemicals technology sustainability and slowing growth could take the chemical industry down an uncertain path where it could end up could become clearer during the conference hosted by the american fuel petrochemical manufacturers afpm the ipc takes place on 24 26 march in san antonio texas additional reporting by joseph chang

the wider economy in china is feeling a credit crunch and its economic growth is slowing the wider economy in china is feeling a credit crunch and its economic growth is slowing the reserve bank of new zealand must have come close to cutting rates when it delivered last month s monetary policy statement according to uk based economist andrew hunt the central bank knows new zealand is exposed to the global slowdown particularly to a slowdown in china and new zealand s banks are dependent on offshore wholesale funding hunt told an investment conference in wellington organised by nikko asset management concerns about liquidity in wholesale interest rate markets globally is one of the reasons the reserve bank is proposing to nearly double banks minimum tier 1 capital to ready the banks to withstand a one in 200 year catastrophe hunt says since the gfc the amount new zealand banks need to borrow from offshore has fallen from about 40 per cent of their assets to about 25 per cent and has shifted from short term borrowing to significantly longer terms hunt says that since regulators in the united states and japan have acted to stop banks from lending in emerging markets the world has gone from a glut of credit to a shortage the world is already in a trade and industrial production recession as a result of that credit squeeze he argues and asian nations have returned to exporting deflation given about a third of us goods are manufactured in asia that s likely to decrease inflation in the us by about 100 basis points and will offset the inflationary impact of rising wages in the us hunt says after the passage of president donald trump s us 1 5 trillion tax package in late 2017 which included incentives for us companies to repatriate capital only about a dozen us companies bothered to bring money back from offshore he says the outcome of the mid term us elections last november which resulted in control of the house of representatives shifting from the republican party to the democratic party was a wake up call for companies which hadn t gotten around to repatriating capital they realised the incentives might not always be available within 10 days of those elections us corporates repatriated us 220 billion flooding us markets with cash during the government shutdown and until very recently hunt says with about us 750 800 billion of treasuries set to be issued in april and may there are questions about who will buy them given three month yields are now higher than on 10 year treasuries he says the three month treasury bills were quoted recently at 2 4527 per cent while 10 year treasury bonds were at 2 439 per cent while the industrial sector in china was beset by a credit crunch through 2018 china s households were saving less and spending more but now the wider economy in china is feeling a credit crunch and its economic growth is slowing hunt says growth is likely to drop to about 3 per cent this year that would be down from 6 6 per cent in 2018 which was already the slowest pace in 28 years growth is also slowing in japan and europe and all this means the imf forecast of 3 per cent world growth in 2019 is a joke hunt says all these events have fed into the reserve bank of new zealand s calculations and hunt says the central bank will sacrifice the new zealand dollar by cutting interest rates to ensure nominal gdp growth if you re a small open economy the easiest way to maintain gdp growth is through your currency if your terms of trade remain quite consistent it works very well he says
a developing story march 25 2019 do social rights affect social outcomes christian bj√∏rnskov jacob mchangama american journal of political science forthcoming abstract while the united nations and ngos are pushing for global judicialization of economic social and cultural rights escrs little is known of their consequences we provide evidence of the effects of introducing three types of escrs into the constitution the rights to education health and social security employing a large panel covering annual data from 160 countries in the period 1960 2010 we find no robust evidence of positive effects of escrs we do however document adverse medium term effects on education inflation and civil rights a forensic examination of china s national accounts wei chen et al brookings papers on economic activity forthcoming abstract china s national accounts are based on data collected by local governments however since local governments are rewarded for meeting growth and investment targets they have an incentive to skew local statistics china s national bureau of statistics nbs adjusts the data provided by local governments to calculate gdp at the national level the adjustments made by the nbs average 5 of gdp since the mid 2000s on the production side the discrepancy between local and aggregate gdp is entirely driven by the gap between local and national estimates of industrial output on the expenditure side the gap is in investment local statistics increasingly misrepresent the true numbers after 2008 but there was no corresponding change in the adjustment made by the nbs we provide revised estimates of local and national gdp by re estimating output of industrial wholesale and retail firms using data on value added taxes we also use several local economic indicators that are less likely to be manipulated by local governments to estimate local and aggregate gdp the estimates also suggest that the adjustments by the nbs were insufficient after 2008 relative to the official numbers we estimate that gdp growth from 2008 2016 is 1 7 percentage points lower and the investment and savings rate in 2016 is 7 percentage points lower does an inclusive citizenship law promote economic development patrick imam kangni kpodar imf working paper january 2019 abstract this paper analyzes the impact of citizenship laws on economic development we first document the evolution of citizenship laws around the world highlighting the main features of jus soli jus sanguinis as well as mixed regimes and shedding light on the channels through which they could have differentiated impact on economic development we then compile a data set of citizenship laws around the world using cross country regressions panel data techniques as well as the synthetic control method and subjecting the results to a battery of tests we find robust evidence that jus soli laws being more inclusive lead to higher income levels than alternative citizenship rules in developing countries though to a less extent in countries with stronger institutional environments technology in 1500 and genetic diversity tiago neves sequeira marcelo santos empirical economics april 2019 pages 1145 1165 abstract the study of the deeply rooted determinants of development technology and innovation is a very recent strand of the literature this paper investigates the relationship between technology in 1500 and the ancestral genetic diversity of populations it shows a strong hump shaped relationship between genetic diversity and technological developments in 1500 this means that some of the technological achievements may stem from the genetic diversity mostly determined more than a millennium before results are robust to the introduction of several controls and to iv estimation moreover our results highlight that agriculture and communication were the technologies most influenced by genetic diversity the world system and the hollowing out of state capacity how structural adjustment programs affect bureaucratic quality in developing countries bernhard reinsberg et al american journal of sociology january 2019 pages 1222 1257 abstract the administrative ability of the state to deliver effective policy is essential for economic development while sociologists have long devoted attention to domestic forces underpinning state capacity the authors focus on world system pressures from western dominated international organizations scrutinizing policy reforms mandated by the international monetary fund imf the authors argue that structural conditions exert deleterious effects on bureaucratic quality by increasing the risk of bureaucrats falling prey to special interests and narrowing potential policy instruments available to them the authors test these arguments using a new data set on imf conditionality from 1985 to 2014 their analysis shows that structural conditions especially conditions on privatization price deregulation and public sector employment reduce bureaucratic quality using instrumentation techniques the authors also discount the possibility that the relationship is driven by the imf imposing structural conditions precisely in countries with low bureaucratic quality a careful reconsideration of imf policy reforms is therefore required to avoid undermining local institutions estimating causal relationships between women s representation in government and corruption justin esarey leslie schwindt bayer comparative political studies forthcoming abstract does increasing the representation of women in government lead to less corruption or does corruption prevent the election of women are these effects large enough to be substantively meaningful some research suggests that having women in legislatures reduces corruption levels with a variety of theoretical rationales offered to explain the finding other research suggests that corruption is a deterrent to women s representation because it reinforces clientelistic networks that privilege men using instrumental variables we find strong evidence that women s representation decreases corruption and that corruption decreases women s participation in government both effects are substantively significant money and modernization in early modern england nuno palma financial history review december 2018 pages 231 261 abstract classic accounts of the english industrial revolution present a long period of stagnation followed by a fast take off however recent findings of slow but steady per capita economic growth suggest that this is a historically inaccurate portrait of early modern england this growth pattern was in part driven by specialization and structural change accompanied by an increase in market participation at both the intensive and extensive levels these i argue were supported by the gradual increase in money supply made possible by the importation of precious metals from america they enabled a substantial increase in the monetization and liquidity levels of the economy hence decreasing transaction costs increasing market thickness changing the relative incentive for participating in the market and allowing agglomeration economies to arise by making trade with asia possible precious metals also induced demand for new desirable goods which in turn encouraged market participation finally the increased monetization and market participation made tax collection easier this helped the government to build up fiscal capacity and as a consequence to provide for public goods the structural change and increased market participation that ensued paved the way for modernization path dependence in european development medieval politics conflict and state building avidit acharya alexander lee comparative political studies forthcoming abstract during the middle ages most european polities operated under a norm that gave only the close male relatives of a monarch a privileged place in the order of succession when no such heirs were available succession disputes were more likely with distant relatives and female line heirs laying competing claims to the throne these disputes often produced conflicts that destroyed existing institutions and harmed subsequent economic development a shortage of male heirs to a european monarchy in the middle ages could thus have harmful effects on the development trajectories of regions ruled by that monarchy we provide evidence for this by showing that regions that were more likely to have a shortage of male heirs are today poorer than other regions our finding highlights the importance of the medieval period in european development and shows how small shocks can work in combination with institutions and norms in shaping long run development paths vestiges of transit urban persistence at a micro scale leah brooks byron lutz review of economics and statistics forthcoming abstract we document intra city spatial persistence and its causes streetcars dominated urban transit in los angeles county from the 1890s to the early 1910s and were off the road entirely by 1963 however we find that streetcars influence remains readily visible in the current pattern of urban density and that this influence has not dissipated in the 60 years since the streetcar s removal we examine land use regulation both as a consequence of streetcars and as a mechanism for streetcars persistent effect our evidence suggests that the streetcar influences modern behavior through the mutually reinforcing pathways of regulation and agglomerative clustering the long run effects of government spending on structural change evidence from second world war defense contracts zhimin li dmitri koustas economics letters may 2019 pages 66 69 abstract this paper studies the long run effects of the largest government spending program in u s history second world war defense spending on structural change in local economies we link a dataset of war supply contracts with economic data at the county level spanning from 1930 to 2000 using counties that received no defense spending as a comparison group and controlling for prewar characteristics we find that wartime defense spending led to sustained reallocation of labor to manufacturing and other non agricultural sectors in war production centers contributing to the long term population growth in those regions institutions and the resource curse evidence from cases of oil related bribery paasha mahdavi comparative political studies forthcoming abstract while some resource rich countries are highly corrupt others have transparent and well functioning governments what explains this wide variation in so called resource cursed states i show that these differences result from domestic institutional choices over how resource extraction is governed some governments grant procurement authority the ability to award contracts for production rights to state owned enterprises whereas others place this authority in ministries building upon agency theory i argue that this choice matters the relative political autonomy of state owned enterprises compared with ministries fosters an opaque regulatory environment that incentivizes malfeasance using new data on transnational bribes in 59 oil producing countries i show evidence for a robust link between oil related institutions and bribery even after addressing the endogeneity of institutional choice via instrumental variables analysis this research has implications not only for the political economy of the resource curse hypothesis but also for existing theories on corruption and regulatory independence diversity institutions and economic outcomes post wwii displacement in poland volha charnysh american political science review forthcoming abstract how does an increase in cultural diversity affect state society interactions do institutional differences between heterogeneous and homogeneous communities influence economic activity i argue that heterogeneity not only impedes informal cooperation but also increases demand for third party enforcement provided by the state over time the greater willingness of heterogeneous communities to engage with state institutions facilitates the accumulation of state capacity and in common interest states promotes private economic activity i test this argument using original data on post wwii population transfers in poland i find that homogeneous migrant communities were initially more successful in providing local public goods through informal enforcement while heterogeneous migrant communities relied on the state for the provision of public goods economically similar during state socialism heterogeneous communities collected higher tax revenues and registered higher incomes and entrepreneurship rates following the transition to the market these findings challenge the predominant view of diversity as harmful to economic development the paradox of power principal agent problems and administrative capacity in imperial china and other absolutist regimes debin ma jared rubin journal of comparative economics forthcoming abstract tax extraction is often low in absolutist regimes why are absolutists unable to convert power into revenue supported by evidence from imperial china we explain this puzzle with a principal agent model which reveals that absolutists unconstrained by rule of law and unable to commit to not predating on their tax collecting agents and the masses may find it optimal to settle for a low wage low tax equilibrium while permitting agents to keep extra unmonitored taxes our analysis suggests that low investment in administrative capacity is a conscious choice for an absolutist since it substitutes for credible commitment to refrain from confiscation from its agents

1 company overview gazprom has the largest natural gas reserves and currently is the most important producer of natural gas in the world it has 17 of the global and 72 of the russian natural gas reserves under control gazprom serves customers in more than 30 countries with a transmission system which has a total length of more than 172 thousand kilometers futhermore the company is russia s largest producer of lng and among the country s four biggest oil producers 1 1 pipelines and projects under construction the pipeline system transmits big amounts of gas to many european and asian countries source gazprom feeds pipelines to germany the balkans the czech republic poland austria bulgaria finland ukraine turkey and western russia the route through the baltic sea is less risky and cheaper for gazprom than the routes to poland and germany for it does not have to pay passthrough fees to belarus or the ukraine hence nord stream 2 which is currently under construction is very important for the gas supply to germany and will reduce gazprom s dependence to neighbour countries like the ukraine gazprom currently has many pipelines under construction to serve more customers especially in china power of siberia turkey turk stream and germany nord stream 2 1 2 the political implications of nord stream 2 due to the crimea crisis in 2014 the ukraine and russia are on a collision course with no hope for easing of tension nord stream 2 will be completed by the end of 2019 and will add 55 bn cubic meters of gas per year to the total supply to germany european countries and the united states want to stop the pipeline because they fear an increasing market share for the russian company gazprom could maximize its market power to raise gas prices for the customers however many members of the eu already import more than 75 of their natural gas from russia and the demand for russian gas is steadily increasing the usa s plan is to import more lng to europe and to compete with russia and norway for gas customers consequently nord stream 2 is a real threat to amercian lng and the us government fights the projects by threatening european companies which are involved in the nord stream 2 construction like richard grenell an us diplomat said that nord stream 2 despite sanctions and strong opposition the german government and the eu parliament support the project and recently came to a compromise which increased the probability of the completion of the pipeline all in all gazprom can increase its gas supply through the baltic sea next year and the project nord stream 2 will pay off in the future 1 3 the power of siberia supply to the world s largest population the pipeline power of siberia is under construction since 2014 and is a cooperation with china national petroleum corporation cnpc the two companies signed a 30 year agreement and the pipeline will provide 38 bn cubic meters of gas per year gazprom expects to start gas supply on december 20 2019 this pipeline is one of two possible pipelines to china and can be seen as an initial cooperation with the 1 4 bn people country as it is likely that china will need more gas in the near future to cover the demand of its people and growing middle class power of siberia reduces gazprom s dependency on europe and is a geographical diversification for the business when finished this year gazprom will earn money with this pipeline and can further reduce construction costs 1 4 turkstream a pipeline through the black sea to turkey and east europe source the map shows the route through the black sea from anapa in russia to luleburgaz in turkey the pipeline won t touch ukrainian territory and consequently gazprom won t pay any fees to neighbour countries for the gas supply turkstream will add 31 5 bn cubic meters per year and the company expects the start of operations in late 2019 turkstream will help gazprom to cover the steadily increasing gas demand of eastern european countries like austria hungary or bulgaria all new projects make sense in the light of a rising demand in all countries which are gazprom s customers by the end of 2019 gazprom s three main projects will be completed which means less costs and increasing earnings 1 5 gazprom neft gazprom neft is one of the biggest russian oil companies and 95 of shares are owned by gazprom pjsc since the oil price collapse in 2014 gazprom neft s earnings tripled from 25 8 rubel per share to 80 rubel in 2018 gazprom directly profit from increasing dividends and a rising oil price which crashed from over 100 nyse wti to under 30 in early 2016 the price recovered last year and now trades for around 59 as of 3 22 2019 if the oil price stabilizes this year or continues to rise gazprom neft will improve gazprom s earnings and profitability 2 earnings history dividends cashflows and balance sheet 2 1 earnings history from 2011 to 2017 gazprom never showed an annual loss and achieved a stable to slightly rising dividend 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 1 9 20182018 e eps in ruble 57 1 51 6 49 7 6 9 34 2 42 1 32 2 46 0 60 0 e dividend per share in ruble 8 97 5 99 7 2 7 2 7 89 8 04 8 04 10 43 e click to enlarge gazprom is expected to earn nearly 60 ruble per share in 2018 and average earnings of the last eight years are 41 8 ruble per share in 2014 the oil and gas prices collapsed and the russian economy suffered from the crimea crisis 2014 was also the year when many pipeline projects started and cost a lot of money in the next decade gazprom will be able to increase earnings because of an increasing gas demand and the completion of several projects 2 2 cashflowscapital expenditures will probably decrease for years which will improve the company s cashflow situation in the first nine month of 2018 gazprom s operating cashflow increased from 613 bn ruble to 1 4 trillion ruble 128 while cashflows from investing were nearly flat as a consequence gazprom could repay more long term debt than last year and showed an increase of cash and cash equivalents of 16 bn rubles for the first nine month of 2018 2 3 dividends the dividend will be 10 43 ruble for 2018 and supported by cashflows will also rise in the future as it does for years now the current payout ratio is below 25 and far away from the government s plan of a minimum payout ratio of 50 gazprom achieved a temporary exemption from the rule as long as the company has to pay for new pipelines if russia forces gazprom to pay 50 of its net income in the near future not only the dividend will double or triple but also the share price will jump higher 2 4 balance sheet the financial situation of gazprom is very solid and good source as of 9 30 2018 gazprom has short term liabilities of around 2 5 trillion rubles but current assets of 3 8 trillion rubles and 0 885 trillion rubles in cash property plant and equipment is the biggest portion of the balance sheet gazprom s equity ratio is 66 8 which shows that it is a financially healthy company 3 valuation gazprom s share capital is divided into 23 673 bn shares and shares currently 3 22 2019 trade for 152 3 rubles or 2 36 per share 1 adr 2 gazprom shares adr price of 4 72 the total market cap is 55 87 bn the pe ratio is 2019 eps of 60 rubles is 2 5 and the pe8 ratio is 3 6 which are very low numbers and show great pessimism among investors the stocks of the peer group trade for higher pe multiples data by ycharts the book value per share is 544 rubles and so the pb ratio is 0 28 which is ridiculously cheap for a blue chip with a multi billion dollar market cap the current dividend yield expected 10 43 rubles per share is 6 8 and the dividend is nicely covered by earnings and will probably rise in the future compared to gazprom s peers the dividend yield is very attractive data by ycharts 4 gazprom s future the golden twenties 4 1 scenario 1 the russian economy keeps growing nord stream 2 will be completed gas demand will rise sharply and gazprom must pay out 50 of its net income probability 55 this scenario offers a huge investment opportunity because gazprom will increase its earnings significantly if nord stream 2 and the power of siberia achieve a 100 workload while gas prices in europe and chine rise and capex falls gazprom can easily double its net profits and will achieve average annual earnings of at least 100 rubles per share if gazprom is forced to raise the payout ratio to 50 50 rubles buying the shares now could lead to outstanding returns a fair share price would be in the range of 800 1000 rubles which is an increase of 425 550 4 2 scenario 2 nord stream 2 will be cancelled but gas demand rises in asia and the payout ratio increase to over 30 probability 30 this scenario is not realistic because nord stream 2 has strong support in europe and the pipeline is right on schedule however even in the case of nord stream 2 cancellation gazprom is strong enough to increase its earnings because of the strong demand in china and the power of siberia which will add 38 bn cubic meters per year to the company s annual gas supply a cancellation of the china pipeline won t happen because the political relationship between the two countries is good and both parties are in favour for the power of siberia it is likely that china will ask for a second pipeline which is already discussed at gazprom this scenario will increase gazprom s average annual earnings for the next decade to 75 80 rubles per share and provides a dividend of 24 rubles a fair share price would be in the range of 500 600 rubles which is an increase of 225 300 4 3 scenario 3 nord stream 2 cancellation recession in russia and china gas demand and dividend remain at current levels probability 15 this scenario is unrealistic because the russian economy is on track for a long term recovery russia survived the big recession during the crimea crisis aftermath and another escalation with europe or the usa is not a real threat at the moment a chinese recession is more likely but the gas demand will increase in the long term by the end of the 2020s the chinese middle class will be more important and wealthier than today and more chinese people will live in heated homes or flats with gas heatings the chinese gas demand will triple by 2040 and gazprom is well positioned to profit from this trend nevertheless scenario 3 could occur but gazprom s earnings will be stable around 50 60 rubles as long as the company can reduce its capex and it will pay a stable dividend of at least 10 15 rubles a fair share price would be at least in the range of 300 450 rubles which means that the stock will double or triple from the current cheap and low levels 5 risks gazprom is a very political stock on the one hand the russian federation owns 38 of gazprom s shares and wladimir putin has a strong influence on alexej miller the ceo of gazprom on the other hand gazprom represents russia in the world and as a result sanctions could hurt the company s businesses and profits as long as many pipelines pass the ukraine gazprom is dependent on the support of european politicans and companies it tries to become more independent by diversify its pipeline system across asia and southern europe furthermore for many european or american investors it is not possible to buy gazprom at the moscow stock exchange so they must buy the adr which also entitles them to the dividend but which is not comparable to regular shares 6 conclusion gazprom is undervalued compared to peers and compared to fair pe and pb ratios for blue chip stocks investors can t expect short term gains as long as political tensions between russia and the united states exist investors need to be patient instead but patience will lead to above average returns even in the worst case scenario all in all gazprom investors will undergo an interesting and golden decade of the twenties editor s note this article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major u s exchange please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks
the asia pacific region has become a hub for financial technology or fintech attracting almost 30 billion in investment last year according to accenture and as fintech businesses proliferate lawyers find their hands full advising these exciting new companies fintech in big business today in asia financial technology companies in the region raised 29 8 billion in 2018 almost twice as much as similar businesses in north america according to a report by consulting firm accenture the report added that about 54 percent of the world s 55 3 billion in fintech investments last year went to the asia pacific with china alone accounting for 46 percent of the total and while a big chunk of this came from a single fundraising round of 14 billion by ant financial a digital payments arm owned by alibaba group investors are certainly looking to the region as a pioneer in innovative payment services according to mark parsons tmt partner and head of hogan lovells corporate practice in hong kong the boom in fintech in the region is a combination of market factors and regulatory initiatives quite a few governments in the region have embraced fintech as a priority area for technological innovation and economic development he says this official support has been backed up by regulatory sandbox initiatives and moves to modernise regulation to facilitate fintech market factors are of course at least as important as the regulatory drivers the outlook varies from country to country but there is generally high consumer acceptance of fintech in asia s increasingly wired increasingly smart economies providing support for established financial institutions and entrepreneurs alike to bring innovations to market victor tse a counsel with bird bird in hong kong says that the rise of asia as a strategic destination for fintech investment is driven by many factors take for example its unique culture he says a significant portion of asia s growing population especially its middle class have long been used to a mobile highly connected and digital way of life with mobile electronic devices forming an integral part of their daily lives the fast pace of life has also set higher customer expectations centred on immediacy convenience and reliability then there is a strong demand for innovative financial services in the region asia is home to a number of major international financial centres including hong kong and singapore says tse the large volume of financial transactions carried out in asia drives and justifies investment into technologies that improve speed efficiency and security also people in asia generally have good appetite for trying new innovative services particularly where this delivers real value or clear efficiencies which encourages businesses to innovate additionally he highlights the fast and efficient way of doing business in the region the main commercial centres in asia all have legal financial systems that meet international standards a reliable tech savvy workforce and stable access to capital market competition in asia drives businesses to assess investment opportunities at a rapid pace notes tse alexander shepherd a partner at bird bird in singapore says that the contrast between richer economies in asia such as singapore hong kong japan taiwan korea and less rich countries such as indonesia philippines vietnam myanmar and cambodia in asia is much starker than in europe regionally there are a significant number of countries with a very high proportion of unbanked consumers he says accordingly there is a significant opportunity for fintech companies to offer payment and e wallet solutions in the less rich countries and significant incentive to do so given the huge success of alipay and others in china the growth of the regional transportation companies such as grab and go jek has enabled them to use their dominance in the transport delivery market to enter the payments market and seek to be the de facto incumbent payment provider in that country he adds approaches to fintech regulation it s impossible to think of the asia pacific as a homogenous bloc with differences in culture economic development and styles of government across its various countries and in the same vein government approaches to fintech have been disparate the only commonality is that governments and regulators in asia all recognise the importance of fintech innovation and have implemented policies and initiatives to support this says tse there are differences in the way fintech is regulated in different asian jurisdictions notes tse the regulators in hong kong hong kong monetary authority or hkma and singapore monetary authority of singapore or mas adopt a relatively measured approach to regulation with the chief executive of hkma noting that the premature and indiscriminate introduction of exhaustive regulations based on a zero risk tolerance and no gaps allowed mindset may hinder the development of fintech there is currently no specific regulatory regime in hong kong and singapore specific to fintech businesses which instead are governed by the established body of laws on financial services that apply to all financial service providers he says that to encourage fintech experimentation the hkma in september 2016 launched the fintech supervisory sandbox fss that allows banks and their partnering technology firms to conduct pilot trials of fintech initiatives involving a limited number of participating customers without the need to achieve full compliance with the hkma s supervisory requirements the mas provides a similar sandbox scheme in singapore as of the end of january 2019 43 pilot trials have been allowed under the hkma s fss notes tse in contrast tse says china takes a more prescriptive approach to fintech regulation firstly multiple regulators are involved with developing regulations for fintech including the people s bank of china pboc china banking regulatory commission cbrc china insurance regulatory commission circ china securities regulatory commission csrc and the ministry of industry and information technology miit he adds since 2015 the chinese regulators have issued various guiding opinions and regulations on internet financing for example online payment lending crowdfunding and online sale of funds peer to peer lending and client verification requirements for online payment systems the regulatory approach in hong kong and singapore is generally seen as setting relatively lower barriers of entry that with effective risk control measures for example via the fss allow and encourage fintech businesses to experiment with new service offerings concepts says tse role of regulators the role of regulators in facilitating and promoting fintech activity cannot be understated says tse and hong kong is one good example in september 2017 the hkma through its fintech facilitation office ffo introduced various initiatives to facilitate fintech development in hong kong and lead hong kong s transformation into the smart banking era he notes tse cites three key initiatives launched in hong kong to boost the fintech scene firstly there was the release in may 2018 of guidelines on authorisation of virtual banks he notes a virtual bank is a bank that primarily delivers retail banking services through the internet or other electronic channels instead of physical branches the hkma has received 30 applications for a virtual bank licence through this programme and is currently conducting due diligence reviews the hkma expects to start granting licences to virtual banks in the first quarter of 2019 secondly he mentions the release in july 2018 of an open application programming interface open api framework the framework allows third party service providers to electronically exchange data with banks to obtain information on products services apply for banking products e g loans and credit cards retrieve update account information and perform banking transactions for authenticated customers says tse banks will implement the open api functionality in phases which will bring more innovative banking services to the public finally he notes the launch in september 2018 of the faster payment system fps being a round the clock service that connects banks and e wallet operators on the same platform it enables the public to transfer funds anytime anywhere across different banks or e wallets with funds available almost immediately says tse transfers can be settled in hong kong dollars or chinese yuan as of the end of january 2019 a total of 23 banks and 10 stored value facility or e wallet operators have participated in the scheme these initiatives provide a critical platform from which fintech businesses are encouraged to work with banks to develop new technology driven service offerings in hong kong he adds meanwhile in singapore the intellectual property office ipos launched in april 2018 a fintech fast track initiative to expedite the file to grant process for fintech patent applications in singapore to as fast as six months tse says it will be interesting to see whether the hong kong intellectual property department hkipd will introduce similar measures when it launches its new original grant patent system which will allow standard patent applications to be filed directly in hong kong opportunities for law firms with this amount of activity taking place not to mention the increasing involvement of regulators in the fintech landscape law firms see an increasing amount of work stemming from the fintech space we have the benefit of advising across the sector advising leading financial institutions and technology companies on digital financial services as well as advising earlier stage companies on legal and regulatory aspects of their growth strategies says parsons we receive many queries about licensing and regulatory requirements with banking securities and payments licences being particularly key he adds that the firm also more broadly advises on compliance with data protection laws and cybersecurity laws as these new companies seek to develop sustainable business models that recognise that data is a valuable asset but also an important responsibility a large part of our practice is commercial work as well dealing with technology acquisition licensing and development and increasingly we are pleased to see collaboration arrangements between and amongst fintechs financial institutions and technology companies tse says he advises fintech companies on a broad range of intellectual property and commercial issues in terms of technology trends there is clear interest in workflow automation intelligent service centres for example using chatbots data mining using machine learning artificial intelligence and novel applications of distributed ledger technology blockchain fintech firms often begin as start ups with a very flexible mindset they know how important it is to define and protect their technical niche and will to invest in intellectual property protection to achieve that however less experienced fintech firms often in their rush to implementation may overlook basic housekeeping issues like having proper agreements in place to ensure the company owns the relevant ip and issues relating to non disclosure agreements and inadvertent disclosures that may prejudice a later patent filing fintech firms often develop their technologies upon tools platform of other technology suppliers or in collaboration with other parties says tse most fintech firms know the importance of conducting proper ip due diligence or freedom to operate review before devoting significant time and investment into developing a brand or technology that belongs to someone else he notes we often help fintech firms devise workarounds to avoid such ip traps which can sometimes lead to an improved solution with new technical advantages this process is relatively straight forward if you work with a legal advisor with the right technical background fintech services are increasing about capturing and making use of data which raises obvious issues concerning cybersecurity data privacy data ownership and data transfer requirements he adds bright future this breakneck development isn t slowing down anytime soon say lawyers tse of bird bird notes there has been significant growth in fintech patent filings in asia in recent years and he expects that trend to continue fintech innovations involving artificial intelligence biometrics and distributed ledger technology will continue to show promise he notes the hkma s open api faster payment service and licensing of virtual banks will define the key growth areas in fintech at least in hong kong in the coming years parsons of hogan lovells agrees saying that hong kong is on the cusp of very significant development with virtual banking licences expected in the next few months and moves by the banking regulator to encourage financial institutions to open up product and customer data to the wider fintech ecosystem meanwhile china has seen a maturing of its fintech landscape with regulatory tightening in key areas such as peer to peer lending parsons says this still leaves an incredibly vibrant fintech environment with ambitions to globalise china is becoming increasingly cashless in its urban centres and this model will deepen much of fintech innovation is data driven and we expect to see the digitalization of financial services taking hold in basic payments functions to spread to other sectors such as private wealth and commercial banking the data intensive aspect of these services is drawing closer attention to data protection and cybersecurity regulations with lawmakers in china india singapore and australia adjusting and continuing to adjust laws and standards in part due to innovations seen in the fintech space he highlights that fintech is here to stay and it will only become a more prominent feature of financial services in asia we have seen ambitious moves by financial institutions to reinvent themselves as fully digital offerings moves by technology companies to leverage their incredible user experiences to deliver new and innovative financial services and the emergence of whole new business models in areas such as distributed ledger technologies and crypto currencies says parsons we continue to see a fairly fragmented landscape across the region and there is great interest in understanding when and where consolidation will start to come moves towards standardisation and inter operability consistency of regulation are critical on this front at the same time moves towards data localisation have a particularly acute impact on pan regional business models so there are some regulatory tendencies emerging that complicate the consolidation story in the u s fintech firms want to shake up banking by pete schroeder of reuters the u s federal reserve is wary of giving fintech firms such as ondeck capital or kabbage access to the country s financial infrastructure putting the central bank at odds with other regulators looking to bring them into the fold the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic are exploring granting federal bank like licenses to tech driven firms that offer financial services such as money transfers and lending the plan is part of a broader push by president donald trump s administration to boost small businesses and promote job growth federal licenses would allow fintech firms which currently operate under a patchwork of state rules to reduce their regulatory costs and expand into new regions and products however fintech firms say they are reluctant to invest heavily in nationwide expansion without access to the payment systems settlement services and other fed tools and the central bank has yet to decide whether to let those lightly regulated players in many fed officials fear these firms lack robust risk management controls and consumer protections that banks have in place they probably do want access to the payments system but they don t want the regulation that would come with that access st louis fed president james bullard told reuters in november i am concerned that fintech will be the source of the next crisis he added companies such as paypal and lendingclub have attracted millions of customers by offering greater convenience or better prices than traditional banks the occ and the fdic say such firms can broaden access to financial services because their low cost models allow them to reach poorly served areas and offer small loans that are uneconomical for bigger banks but some fintech firms say they would be reluctant to invest the time and resources in applying for and maintaining the new occ fintech license unless the fed gives them access to the payments system so they will not have to depend on banks to route money for them direct access would eliminate bank routing fees a top five operating cost for many fintech firms and would allow them to compete more effectively with traditional lenders it s hard to know if it s worthwhile applying if you don t know what access you d have to the fed services said jason oxman ceo of the electronic transactions association which represents fintechs and banks it would be helpful for the fed to clarify banks are pushing back arguing fintech firms should access the fed system only if they comply with the same rules banks face you don t want a new charter that skirts existing rules and regulations and call that innovation said paul merski executive vice president for the independent community bankers of america unveiled in july the occ special charter allows fintechs to operate nationwide under a single license provided they satisfy some liquidity capital and contingency planning requirements currently state regulators that oversee fintechs focus primarily on consumer protections such as capping interest rates on lending products privacy safeguards and preventing unfair or deceptive practices some states may also require firms to comply with anti money laundering rules submit business plans or allow onsite examinations by comparison nearly every aspect of banks operations is subject to rigorous scrutiny and multiple federal and state laws these include a host of capital and liquidity requirements operational risk cyber risk vendor risk anti money laundering and bank secrecy rules fair lending and anti discrimination lending laws the occ fintech charter does not permit companies to collect federally insured deposits now a precondition for accessing the fed s payment system to contact the editorial team please email albeditor

on thursday president trump once again criticized the chair of the federal reserve jerome h powell blaming the central bank for the u s economy s slowing growth that s an echo of his march 2 complaint at a conservative political action conference and of quite a few such critiques during 2018 when the president called out the fed for steadily raising interest rates and in late 2018 rumors circulated that trump had been asking whether he could dismiss powell as chairman after controversially declining to renominate previous chair janet l yellen only a year earlier those rumors led powell to declare on cbs s 60 minutes that he has every intention of serving his four year term while trump s open criticism is unusual in its tone and volume presidential dismay about fed policy is not william mcchesney martin who led the fed from 1951 to 1970 and was its longest serving chairman once called the fed s job to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going central banks often hike interest rates to prevent inflation distressing politicians who would rather keep rates low help fuel economic activity and thereby improve their reelection chances but our research shows that the more strongly insulated a country s central bank is from political interference the less a country has to pay to finance its national debts advertisement two recent illustrations over the summer and early fall of 2018 investors became weary of the monetary policy in turkey and argentina in both countries inflation was rising and investors were concerned about their respective central banks independence in turkey the president shortened the term in office of the central bank governor and deprived the central bank governor of any say in selecting deputy governors in argentina two central bank governors resigned in 2018 signaling policy disagreements with the government quickly investors began selling both the turkish lira and the argentine peso during 2018 both currencies lost about half their value against the dollar and both countries had to pay significantly higher interest rates to entice investors to purchase their debt the united states benefits from a unique position in the global financial system that affords it cheap access to capital yet there may be consequences even for the united states from a public brawl between the president and the fed so do the anecdotes illustrate anything larger are there measurable costs to meddling with the independence of a country s central bank or firing its head advertisement how we did our research we evaluated the economic costs of political interference by asking whether the governance of a country s central bank influences the nation s credit ratings assigned by standard poor s and moody s credit ratings are important because they affect whether a nation can access capital markets and how much such loans will cost the higher a country s credit rating the stronger the rating agencies confidence that the country will be able and willing to repay its debt when it comes due more confidence generally means a likelihood of a loan at lower rates our empirical analysis uses data from 1973 to 2010 from 78 developed and developing countries for each country we measure its credit rating issued by either moody s or standard poor s we convert the original ratings aaa aa a or aaa aa1 aa3 into 17 point numeric scales we measure central bank governance in two distinct ways advertisement first we use an index that codes countries laws to capture the legal autonomy of central banks to make monetary policy decisions independent from the political needs of governments this is a well accepted index that we updated in previously published work a central bank has more legal independence when the governor s term in office is longer the appointment and dismissal procedures are insulated from the government the bank s mandate is focused on price stability and the terms on central bank lending to the government are restrictive second we aim to capture tensions in the relation between the central bank and the government usually reflected by the dismissal or resignation of the central bank governor or chair we measured the departure of the head of the central bank before the end of the legal term in office independent central banks improve a country s credit ratings and government interference brings those ratings down advertisement we find strong evidence that greater legal central bank independence improves a country s credit ratings for example in january 2016 standard poor s lowered its outlook for poland s sovereign credit specifically noting that the governing law and justice party was weakening democratic institutions independence including that of poland s central bank standard poor s however raised its outlook in december 2016 when it judged that the governing party was no longer threatening the central bank generally open conflict about central bank autonomy as when a government dismisses or prompts the resignation of a central bank s governor reduces a nation s credit ratings for example in december 2018 after india s central bank s governor resigned moody s warned india s government to protect the central bank s independence why does central bank governance matter advertisement why do credit rating agencies closely watch how central banks are governed good governance serves as a heuristic that reduces uncertainty about the prospects of countries first preserving legal central bank independence signals that the government is committed to general macroeconomic stability including repaying its debt second when the central bank and the government have disagreements major enough to cause resignations or dismissals investors worry about increased uncertainty surrounding countries future policies central bank independence tells investors they can expect stable inflation and a predictable monetary policy good governance has long lasting effects dismissing or pushing out a central bank s head determine rating agencies to immediately downgrade the country s credit rating and the negative effect of the central bank s head irregular replacement will continue to be reflected in a lower credit rating over many years no wonder chairman powell insists that the fed does not take politics into account in making decisions about interest rates cristina bodea is an associate professor of political science at michigan state university
polaris industries nyse pii is a global powersports vehicle manufacturer the company operates in multiple segments including off road vehicles orv snowmobiles and motorcycles in which it holds the 1 2 and 2 market share position respectively it manufactures both gas powered and all electric all terrain vehicles under multiple brand names around the globe its snowmobile sales come primarily from the united states canada russia and northern europe where growth is the highest the company is reliant on global independent dealers which share the costs and profits from each product sold in 2018 these dealers made 1 6 billion in gross sales based on the company s financial reporting beyond the fact that sales are rather cyclical for the company the entire industry is extremely cyclical to global economic conditions these types of activities and sales excluding mobility assistance perhaps are reliant on hobbies and spare time activities and show slumps in times of recessions as more and more signals are flashing for a cyclical slowdown in global consumer spending the company is on the ropes this time around with high inventory and regular expenses given the amount of debt it has taken on i believe the company will underperform the market in case a recession does indeed hit industry overview the off road vehicle market is comprised primarily of all terrain vehicles atv and side by side vehicles with the former showing some decline in sales in 2018 but the latter showing an increase atvs sold around 370 000 units in 2018 while side by side vehicles topped 500 000 in the same time period which based off those numbers and an industry wide asp show the company as the market leader with the number one market share position the snowmobile market has seen increased sales in 2018 with the company estimating around 125 000 units being sold around the globe based off these numbers and industry asp the company holds the number two market share spot the motorcycle market is comprised of four segments cruisers touring sport bikes and standard motorcycles with sales dipping slightly to 190 000 in north america in 2018 one of the company s core market brands 900cc and above motorcycles also decreased slightly in 2018 and sold around 300 000 around the globe the company holds the second largest market share based off their sales and unit sales according to the company the company also has products to target the global adjacent markets which include mobility supporters light duty haulers industrial and urban commuting and tactical defense vehicles the addressable market is around 6 billion according to the company and they ve only just scratched the surface the company also targets what they call the aftermarket market which include parts garments and accessories and have an addressable market of around 10 billion the powersports market is also one the company is targeting with their products and has a 2 billion addressable market of which the company has barely touched the surface of and believes to have great potential in the company s recently acquired a boats market segment which helps them target an 8 billion industry of recreational marine boats which include bowrider cruiser pontoon and fishing boats the company believes fishing boats and pontoon boats are the fastest growing market segment and have adjusted their sales strategy accordingly all data according to company research and financial filings possible recession positioning throughout 2018 the company recorded much higher overall expenditures which were boosted by higher inventories with finished goods rising nearly 30 from the previous year this resulted in a high factory inventory expense of 108 million it is unclear if higher overall sales expectations were not met or if some other factor contributed to this rise which also included a rise in raw materials and parts another factor is the company s expansion it does own a good portion of its over 6m square feet of manufacturing r d wholesale distribution and other facilities around the world but its higher expansion costs right ahead of a possible cyclical slowdown in sales in the united states is not a good sign given the higher interest expense and the natural depreciation in manufacturing and other hardware and property any forced cost cutting measures will result in a net loss on investment for the company debt and spending the company has a debt issue after its acquisitions of tap and boat holdings in 2016 and 2018 respectively as it took on over 1 billion in debt to fund those acquisitions resulting in total debt holdings of 1 962 billion as a result of this debt and the fact that a substantial portion of their borrowings are subject to libor or prime rate changes interest expense climbed to 57 million in 2018 and is expected to be just under 80 million for 2019 cash flows are very uncertain with polaris given its capital expenditures expected for the upcoming years in 2017 the company normalized their spending habits but continued on course with nearly 1 billion in investing activities throughout 2018 if the company limits expansion and new facility manufacturing along with being more strategically focused when it comes to acquisitions or simply being forced to do so in a recessionary scenario they can comfortably generate 500 million in cash the company spent 350 million on share repurchases in 2018 like many other companies polaris falsely thought the market would continue to rise only a fraction of that was spent post december of 2018 and the company has 3 25m shares left to be repurchased under its various authorizations which totaled 90m shares since 1996 87m of which they used which means they have under 300 million in expense potential related to share buybacks in 2019 pending any new authorization plan expected cash flows from operations of 500 million for 2019 gets fairly diluted when you take into account 150 million in cash dividend and 80 million in interest expense that leaves 270 million which is just enough to repurchase the 3 25m remaining shares any increases beyond the previous year levels in capital expenditures will result in a net loss of cash in which the company only has 160 million of as of their latest report the company generated only 31 million in net cash for the entire 2018 reporting period expectations and projections the company has been showing a boost in revenues because of the aforementioned acquisitions of tap and boat holdings which contributed 700 million to sales in 2017 and 208 million in 2018 respectively the company s tap holdings are categorized under their aftermarket revenue segment nonetheless current projections based off the company s core addressable markets call for a nice bump in both sales and eps in the coming years 2019 eps is expected at 6 09 and sales at 6 78 billion an 11 5 rise from 2018 for 2020 eps of 6 96 and sales of 7 01 billion are expected a 14 3 and 3 4 rise from the prior year respectively for 2019 the company expects a combination of trade tariffs currency fluctuations and higher interest rates to have a 1 50 impact per share to earnings this may overall be a conservative estimate with no trade resolution in sight and currency fluctuations remaining on the high end due to global uncertainty on multiple fronts the company has 55 million in currency derivatives against the canadian dollar which is in losing territory and mexican peso longs from after the 2016 presidential elections which are in the money these hedges can cause another headwind for the company if trade disputes don t settle in the near future investment conclusion and valuation even though polaris has exceptional brand recognition alongside the 1st or 2nd market share position in most of its operating business segments it s clear by recent developments which include debt fueled acquisitions and expansions that the company is not well prepared for a cyclical slowdown in spending from a valuation standpoint given the uncertain prospect ahead for 2019 and the company s balance sheet headwinds i believe their fair value lies in an earnings multiple of around 14x which results in a 2019 price target of 85 00 per share this represents a neutral position on the company for the year ahead and if a recessionary spending environment does indeed occur in 2019 i believe the company will post negative sales growth which won t justify a valuation over 10x earnings which implies a price target of around 60 00 per share assuming they still post 6 09 in eps all in all this is a prime way to play a looming recession which if one does occur the company is positioned poorly with high interest expense and inventories which may be out of style and sold for discounted prices i remain neutral on the company until more consumer spending data comes in
gold bars in the face of prevalent political and economic uncertainties across the universe particularly in major developed countries such as the united states and the united kingdom the allure of gold as the safe haven stock to hold and the appetite for amassing it has seldom been so sharply focused as in today s troubled times with the ongoing global trade war between the fading and fast emerging super powers such as america and china making little progress how can the rest of the world remain calm the latest report of the world gold council wgc makes quite a revealing study about how countries prefer to place their faith in the yellow metal which was derided as the relic of a barbaric era by the renowned economist keynes that both nations and the constituents people opt to have their safe bets latched on to bullion is demonstrated by the fact that retail investment in coin was mostly made by individuals as a safety measure against turbulent times it zoomed to touch a five year pinnacle in 2018 of 236 4 tonnes and demand for gold bars held steady at 781 6 tonnes interestingly even central banks added a hefty 651 5 tonnes to official gold reserves in 2018 the second highest yearly total on record global gold mine production too inched up to a new record high of 3 347 tonnes last year bolstered by a healthy production pipeline net purchases jumped to their peak since the end of us dollar convertibility into gold in 1971 as the swathe of central banks turned to gold as a relieving diversifier from risks than any other form of investments including currencies this is predicated on the palpable fear that there might be greater currency volatility given the taut geopolitical situation and trade tensions among major powers with each slapping trade retaliatory tariffs and erecting formal and informal barriers across the free movement of goods the added apprehension is that with the mighty us dollar being likely to be buffeted by the unpredictable policy gyrations of the us and the anemic economic recovery in most of europe given the lacklustre performance and clash ridden situation such as in britain over brexit or in france over popular uprisings against macron s economic policies the holding of bullion looks attractive as its returns in local currency terms are quite mouth watering near home india that always boasts of being the largest consumer of gold is now ranked as being in possession of the eleventh largest gold reserves in the world india s overall position in terms of gold holding pegged at 607 tonnes would have been tenth had the roaster covered only countries and not institutions such as the international monetary fund imf which is third on the list with total gold reserves of 2814 tonnes for the record the foremost slot is held by the united states which with gold reserves of 8133 5 tonnes is followed by german with 3 369 7 tonnes barring imf italy and france finish the top five slots with reserves of a little over 2400 tonnes each among the asian nations china and japan possess 1864 3 tonnes and 765 2 tonnes respectively way ahead of india the new trend witnessed last year in gold holdings by countries persisted well into the first month of 2019 too with wgc computing that gross purchases of 48 tonnes and gross sales of 13 tonnes leading to global gold reserves rising by 35 tonnes on a net basis in january with substantial spurts from nine central banks mostly from the emerging economies in india the lure of gold both for making ornaments for retail sale and also by way of keeping bullion in the form of small sovereigns biscuits as safe investment bet remain too strong to be dissuaded by the authorities to wean them away from their entrenched habits this can be seen from the fact that imports of gold including gold dore bars during most of the modi sarkar tenures were around 915 tonnes in 2014 15 968 tonnes in 2015 16 780 tonnes in 2016 17 and 955 tonnes in 2017 18 the relative slump in the import during 2016 17 might be partly due to demonetization of high denominational currencies clamped by the government on november 8 2016 however the situation resumed its normalcy the very next year but the import costs always hovered between 32 to 34 41 billion dollars a year save during 2016 17 when it cost 27 52 billion dollars as the volume imported was also less although the nda government fashioned the gold monetization scheme gms to persuade people to make better use of the idle assets in their homes roughly only 1134 kilograms of gold were collected from the individuals hindu undivided families during the two years 2016 2018 however the authorities were able to get approximately 10 872 kilogrammes of gold from temples trusts mutual funds gold exchange traded funds and other entities such as companies and firms under the gms during these two years though the government claims that idle gold held by households trusts and various bodies in the country is deposited under the gms which has benefitted the jewellery industry with the gold gleaned being used to lend gold as gold metal loan the amount of gold deposited or recycled for the trade was no patch on the gargantuan appetite for the yellow metal and people s dogged faith in gold as a savior when there is an economic predicament unless and until unvarnished campaigns are made by celebrities to dissuade the purchase of the idle asset against their extant promotional campaigns for jewellery shops more serious results from schemes like the gms would seldom happen analysts plaintively say the author is

justin s note it s totally incorrect week here at casey research we ve shared doug casey s uncensored insights on topics ranging from the climate change hoax to the next 9 11 type event but today s essay may be the most controversial one yet doug says a disaster of historic proportions is on the menu for 2019 and it s critical to understand what s happening read on for four specific predictions about what lies ahead some of these predictions may seem outlandish but you owe it to yourself to hear what he has to say right on the money casey doug best price 7 46 buy new 13 68 as of 07 45 utc details prediction 1 the end of retirement the average american can forget about retirement we ve all heard these stories about how the average american couldn t lay his hands on 1 000 to save his life his expenses aren t going away however even if his income does it seems like things have reached a critical mass and if the economy slows down there are going to be a lot of people losing their homes again they ll be unable to pay their credit card bills their car payments their student loans or anything else they aren t going to be able to buy anything they wound up in breadlines in the 30s but today 40 million americans have snap cards to take away the hunger pains and embarrassment of being penniless there could be 100 million in a few years i know this sounds outrageous because right now everything is running fairly smoothly the standard of living of the average middle class american has degraded slowly over decades but hasn t yet totally collapsed but that s the way it is a day before a volcano explodes or a day before an earthquake or minutes before an avalanche starts coming down this isn t a theoretical discussion most retirement plans are in serious jeopardy many pension funds are already seriously underwater even after a very long boom the situation is likely to deteriorate the stock market is in a bubble the bond market is in a hyper bubble a lot of value could disappear very quickly by the time this depression bottoms in today s dollars i don t know what the dollars are going to be worth the dow could trade at 5 000 or less we re going to see interest rates exceed what we saw in the early 1980s when the u s government was paying 15 from a retiree s point of view things are not going to improve it s going to get worse not better his savings if he has any are going to be attacked from several angles i don t see any way out of this unless friendly aliens land on the roof of the white house and present trump with some kind of magic technology prediction 2 a white male privilege tax and other radical tax hikes you ve got to remember that the prime directive of any organism whether it s an amoeba a person a corporation or a government is to survive bankrupt governments and they re all bankrupt because of welfare state policies are going to fight to survive the only way that they can survive is to tax more and print more money and that s exactly what they re going to do of course don t discount a war these fools actually believe that would stimulate the economy the way only turning lots of cities into smoking ruins can i suspect they ll try to make white males bear most of the burden that s partly because they still have most of the money and partly because it s become fashionable to hate white males in particular it s natural to want to hurt people that they think are the problem what marxists would say are the class enemy we re going to see much higher taxes among other unsavory things there s no other way to pay for welfare state programs except sell more debt to the fed which they ll also do by necessity inflation will get out of control as a result of course you ve got to remember that as recently as the eisenhower administration the top marginal tax rate was theoretically 91 the average person didn t pay anywhere remotely near that because it was a steeply progressive tax rate nobody did frankly especially the rich because there were loads of tax shelters which no longer exist hiding money offshore among other things was easy now these things are out of the question now there s no place to hide from the state and envy is rampant how bad could it get in sweden during the 1970s the marginal tax rate including their wealth tax was something like 102 so almost anything is possible of course they ll raise taxes radically it s time to eat the rich prediction 3 like venezuela socialism will conquer the u s its ideas already have first we should define what socialism is it s state ownership of the means of production it was supposed to be a passing stage on the road to communism communism is communal ownership of private goods houses cars shops and consumer items as well as capital goods nobody even talks about that anymore since capitalism has given most people so much stuff that they don t even have room to store it all socialism in the u s is unlikely governments have found it s much more efficient to simply have the state control capital as opposed to owning and operating it it s so much easier to just take as much as they want of the profits then blame the capitalists if something goes wrong with delivery of the goods forgetting about north korea and cuba there are no socialist states anywhere in the world what we have instead are welfare states where the government provides some degree of free schooling free medical care free housing free food and so forth if not free then subsidized the next step is a guaranteed annual income the word socialism today is actually just shorthand for a welfare state which is what boobus americanus the hoi polloi really want they don t really care who owns the factories the fields and the mines what they care about is that somebody gives them a soft life when you give people the ability to vote themselves free stuff at somebody else s expense they ll do it but much worse they now actually think it s the right thing to do why mainly because of the propaganda that they ve absorbed through college and the media the entertainment world and numerous other places there s no question about the fact that the u s will turn into a full fledged welfare state socialism is basically about the forceful control of other people s lives and property it isn t just an intellectual failing it s actually a moral failing although perversely it s sold as being moral people buy it because they like to believe they re doing the right thing totally incorrect con louis james best price 2 00 buy new 9 41 as of 04 45 utc details it will end with an economic collapse then a political and most importantly a cultural collapse prediction 4 a new 9 11 type event real or a contrived false flag it s entirely possible it s still completely undetermined what actually happened on 9 11 and who was actually behind it notwithstanding that considering how the u s government continues to provoke people all over the world there s certainly some group most likely mohammedans who ll decide to strike out against the great satan and as 9 11 showed regardless of who was actually responsible a very small number of people can have a very large effect on things especially when the system itself is critically unstable which it is today they might do something like mumbai in 2008 it took only two dozen fanatics with ordinary guns they turned the whole city totally on its head for days that was extremely cheap low tech and easy warfare has always been a matter of economics cheap trumps expensive there are scores of ways to severely disrupt an advanced society for a trivial investment on the other hand it s extremely expensive to disrupt a primitive society as the u s is discovering in afghanistan anyway terrorism is an extremely low cost method of warfare it will have a gigantic effect when someone decides to use it in the u s 9 11 was just an amuse bouche you can plan your life around something like that happening again the world is evolving at the rate of moore s law in many regards let me emphasize that military technology is changing too aircraft carriers b2s f35s m1 tanks and so forth are basically junk great for fighting the soviet union which no longer exists they serve no useful purpose in the kind of battles that are likely in the future if someone wants to attack the u s they re not going to use an icbm they re extremely expensive clunky and you can see where they come from guaranteeing retaliation it s total idiocy that even a maniac wouldn t bother with not when you can deliver a backpack nuke by fedex cheap and on time or you could use any commercial aircraft container ship or truck if you want to blame iran and really whip up the u s population there would be nothing like a small nuclear or radiological attack to do it it s a pity since they re a distant regional power with a failing economy who present about zero threat to the u s if i were to attempt putting my finger on exactly when the u s will go over the edge i would think the real catalyst might be the next 9 11 type event i don t doubt it s going to happen how are we any different than the germans in the 1920s

diplomat and historian george f kennan writing as mr x sent an 8 000 word telegram to the us state department in 1946 about joseph stalin s aggressive foreign policy warning there would be no permanent peaceful coexistence between the united states and soviet union whose analysis provided an influential underpinning for america s cold war policies on the soviet challenge to the us dominated capitalist and liberal order kennan wrote the main element of any united states policy toward the soviet union must be that of a long term patient but firm and vigilant containment of russian expansive tendencies the soviet union historically one of the most powerful rivals of the united states collapsed decades ago nonetheless as author mark twain reputedly said history often rhymes and threats to the us led liberal international order have not yet been eliminated china is a member or signatory to hundreds of global institutions conventions treaties agreements and committees rand corporation 2018 the current order wrestles with both external interference and internal division on one hand the us leadership faces widening bifurcation between american first policies and keeping to the path of globalisation on the other hand a growing china dangles strength with assertive industrial policies and barely disguised ambition to transcend its rival interpreted by some as the harbinger of a new cold war between china and the united states there are many ways to address the question on whether china challenges the current world order from beijing s intentions or its de facto role in the current system many express concern that china is likely to challenge us leadership and incantation of a china threat the title of a book by bill gertz recalls the cold war era minxin pei a political scientist likewise claimed china is undermining the western liberal order in terms of ideological threats meanwhile china once a poor and weak country now sets rules for a number of industries from infrastructure to ai technologies and from trade regulation to international law for example huawei a china based telecommunications equipment company has been a leading actor in the 5g network the answer to this complicated question can be divided into three layers china reshaping itself to engage actively in the current world order rising and gradually asserting its global influence while also contributing innovations the current world order renovated at the end of the cold war has operated for decades under us dominance political democracy and capitalism market economy are the most prominent characteristics with the united states and the european union typically supporting democratic movements and globalisation regarded as liberal values that strengthen ties and foster respect for the rule of law both within and among countries free trade the engine of economic growth binds countries together so that war is deemed too costly to wage in retrospect china abandoned its soviet like planned economy model in 1978 starting market oriented reforms and gradually opening the market to private and foreign sectors china partially adjusted its financial institutions and industrial establishment and became a major component of the current order the government ultimately lifted price controls and actively engaged in the global trade system joining the world trade organisation in 2001 and becoming a major exporter during the recent waves of anti globalisation china portrays herself as a firm advocate of multilateralism and free trade with president xi jinping repeatedly emphasising that economic globalisation is inevitable and irreversible furthermore china is one of five countries with a un security council veto and welcomes development support from international institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund china is now the second largest funder of un peacekeeping forces participating in multiple un programs in 2015 beijing joined with washington in developing new norms for dealing with climate change and cyberspace conflicts china s economic institutions are still complicated distinguished from those in western countries with its conspicuous state intervention in general china so far cannot overthrow or challenge the current world order from which it receives significant benefits rather china adapts secondly a rising china exerts global influence in many areas despite an authoritarian regime china has achieved rapid economic growth gaining stakes to fill the power vacuum caused by wavering us positions according to the atlantic council the united states still maintains a lead in global influence but its share is declining not only in east asia but also outside the region including in nato member states and parts of africa china has surpassed us influence the united states is cutting support to a number of international institutions and agreements for example the trump administration announced us withdrawal from the 2015 paris agreement on climate change denied the value of global cooperation to tackle global warming and abandoned the iran nuclear deal despite an onslaught of criticism the united states left unesco and the un human right council cutting 1 3 billion from the un budget while suspending support for some refugee programs the us played a crucial role in global politics and its absence regardless of reasons will leave many problems unresolved and others in disarray source atlantic council meanwhile china increases its influence on the international stage with financial backing china s un contribution will rise to just over 12 for the period 2019 to 2021 granting the country more power in international affairs china s voting rights in the international monetary fund have increased and it holds a deputy director position in europe and the united states chinese expansion of overseas investment both in terms of quantity and quality reflects the chinese economy s growing sophistication and desire for greater global influence in particular the fact that chinese foreign direct investment targets cutting edge technologies and the role played by the chinese government in mergers and acquisitions has prompted an urgent response to determine if chinese investments threaten eu security and public order in the united states china also utilises methods such as co optation and acquisitions to complete corporate transfers many of these technologies such as supercomputing artificial intelligence robotics semiconductors drones hypersonic and 3d printing will help determine the future of global economy chinese and american scholars devote particular attention to analysis of the international order in anticipation of the changes that china s rise might bring with anxiety over redistribution of power the united states defends its international dominance from shrinking and china seeks to strengthen its international influence the so called thucydides trap thirdly with growing economic strength china is gaining confidence to provide innovations to the current order pointing out that maintaining the current system is not enough to cope with emerging challenges for example with globalisation trade does not benefit all countries the income gap is growing between developed and developing countries rich and poor south and north chinese leaders repeatedly stress that china remains a powerful supporter of the current order taking action not to replace existing organisations but supplementing them to strengthen that order china is building the asian infrastructure investment bank with more than 65 countries signing on as members the new institution provides funding for china s ambitious belt and road initiative aiming to enhance regional connectivity and prosperity on this basis china has proposed the concept of building a community of human destiny a natural result of interactions between china and the international order china portrays itself as a responsible alternative rejecting trade protectionism and economic nationalism one way or another china s rise challenges the balance of the us led order among the many forces contributing to its deterioration including refugee crises climate change and terrorism the united states does not offer a grand narrative appealing to large majorities domestically much less to other states a new equilibrium is underway and the process will last until the united states and china find a balance on power xueying zhang is a fox fellow at yale university she is pursuing her phd degree in international relations at fudan university china her research interests include east asia economic strategies international institutions and the world order she is also devoted to youth contributions to global affairs and represented china in the g20 youth summit 2017 yue hans zhu is a graduate student at yale economics department whose concentration is public policy and

philly com eleven years after it started buying trillions of dollars of mortgage bonds in an emergency campaign to prevent bloated banks from failing the federal reserve still has some normalizing to do but it s still not ready to sell those bonds and rush back to its smaller prerecession form federal reserve bank of philadelphia president pat harker told an international crowd of bank regulators and bankers monday in london england our aim is for the balance sheet to consist primarily of treasury securities but that is not its current composition and won t be for some time with still accounting for 40 percent of our total asset holdings harker acknowledged in prepared remarks to the official monetary and financial institutions forum released at 10 30 a m eastern time while president trump has urged a continued policy of cheap money to keep businesses and consumers borrowing the fed has felt pressure from conservative economists to boost interest rates and cut back its swollen balance sheet so it will be better able to fight the next recession the fed has decided not to rock the boat even if the u s economy slows down as some investors worry it will this year or next the balance sheet will not see any drastic change in the near future harker underlined bank bonds parked at the fed still total around 1 6 trillion 1 2 trillion less than the peak of 2 8 trillion back in 2014 and close to 600 billion less than when we started unwinding but still more than triple the precrisis fed harker noted the fed has shrunk enough for now and has no intention of going all the way back to its more modest profile of the early 2000s harker made clear we intend to end the balance sheet runoff in september resuming the reinvestment of all principal payments paydowns from 20 billion per month will be reinvested into which is consistent with our long standing plans to hold primarily treasuries in our portfolio that will still leave fed reserves above the level needed to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy harker amplified and put in context remarks by fed chairman jerome powell a trump appointee last week powell on friday said it is more likely the fed will stop shrinking its balance sheet now that it has halted a trend of boosting interest rates noted ryan sweet head of monetary policy research at moody s analytics the debate about the policy response to the next recession is good to have now the fed will have to think outside the box to address the next recession because they won t have as much fire power with regards to cutting interest rates as in the past added sweet though trump has urged the fed to stop boosting rates which he says will slow the economy powell has said the fed is moving away from higher rates for economic not political reasons this doesn t mean the fed has given up on fighting a future recession the central bank is still prepared to alter the size and composition of the balance sheet if future economic conditions call for the fed to fight a slowdown harker added but the fed does not plan to go there for a time more likely we will see a very and i do stress very gradual decrease in average reserves as currency and other non reserve liabilities grow but no more bonds are purchased the fed s plan is lacking in details says economist david r kotok chairman and chief executive of cumberland advisers sarasota fla harker doesn t say what economic conditions would trigger changes to the fed s new slow shrinking policy he doesn t say how to estimate the fed s long term balance sheet targets or what economic forces will change those targets and the fed s future efforts to boost the economy kotok concluded harker said economists at the philly fed led by roc armenter had conducted analyses that support this slow and steady approach which he called the safer option and one that reduces uncertainty about the fed s intentions making it more predictable and he warned against misinterpreting the federal reserve open market committee s intentions based on a few keywords in its statements which reporters and economists sometimes seem to regard as oracular revelations for example we often refer to the fomc s tool kit when discussing policy options balance sheet policy certainly remains an option but we ve put it back in the toolbox and stored it in the basement within arm s reach but out of sight for now harker added stressing that he was speaking for himself and not the fed as a whole harker predicted gdp growth a bit above 2 percent for this year returning to trend of around 2 percent sometime in 2020 as a result of the u s s aging population slow growing workforce and lower productivity growth consumers remain the primary driver of economic growth and harker noted that household spending continues at a strong sustained pace but business to the contrary is reporting an increase in uncertainty and a decrease in confidence the investment outlook is not quite as rosy as last year though the long obama trump era expansion continues with the economy reporting nearly 200 000 new jobs a month and inflation at around 2 percent as president of the philly fed harker is one of 11 regional fed heads who rotate on and off voting member seats on the open market committee which sets interest rate guidelines in hopes of controlling prices employment levels and bank solvency

tom barton the state columbia with 96 million south carolina could purchase 1 100 new school buses build two interstate interchanges or provide a one time bonus for state employees worth five percent of their salaries or state legislators could give it back to taxpayers who could buy what amounts to a tank of gas and a fast food lunch that second option to return 96 million in extra state money to every s c taxpayer in a flat 50 rebate check is gaining steam south carolina has nearly 1 billion in new money to play with in next year s budget most of that money has been set aside to pay for rising education pension and health care costs and raises for state employees including teachers among other priorities republican state legislators say those same lawmakers say the rest of the new money 96 million should go back into taxpayers pockets when you look at one billion new dollars in south carolina s economy to take 10 percent of that revenue and return it back to the taxpayers i think is a good thing said house majority leader gary simrill r york it s both symbolic and a goodwill gesture back to the people of south carolina who worked hard to fill the state s coffers not even a drop in the bucket republican gov henry mcmaster first proposed the idea of a rebate in his executive budget in january which called for returning 200 million to taxpayers we keep telling the taxpayers that our jobs in state government is to find ways to save money to spend money wisely and whenever we can return their tax money mcmaster said at the time this is the right year to make good on that promise and return that money to the citizens it s not an uncommon request especially coming from gop leaders who campaign on promises to keep government lean and taxes low the state s economic and population growth has meant more money flowing into the state s coffers each year and more money to spend republican lawmakers supporting the rebate say struggling south carolinians would benefit from it regardless of the size of the check anyone who paid state income taxes in 2018 would receive a 50 check in the mail from s c department of revenue it moves the needle in a family that is struggling who works every day to put food on the table simrill said but critics of giving that extra money back to taxpayers argue the new money is needed to provide services to a growing population in a state that a decade ago suffered massive recession era budget cuts and is still recovering democrats say the tax refund will do little to move the needle in a state where persistently low pay for teachers and state employees has led to schools and agencies struggling to hold on to talented employees and fill vacancies opponents of giving the refund also say the money would be better spent on employee bonuses and a backlog of deferred road bridge prison and state building upgrades the economy also won t see much of a boost from returning 96 million to consumers so they can spend it consumer spending in the state totaled more than 169 billion in 2017 according to the u s bureau of economic analysis it s not even a drop in the bucket state rep gilda cobb hunter d orangeburg said a one time shot of 50 is not going to have any permanent impact and all it does is allow politicians to thump their chest and say oh look at us didn t we do good when in reality all we are doing is make ourselves feel better the millions of dollars cobb hunter and other democrats contend could help shore up chronic funding woes at state agencies that would lead to improved safety and services to south carolinians for example one year after a deadly riot at lee correctional institution where seven inmates died s c prisons still lack modern equipment and standard safety features such as automatic locks prison staff currently must manually lock and unlock cell doors which takes up the majority of their day corrections director bryan stirling said currently if there ever was a serious fire at a prison it would be difficult for staff to evacuate all inmates from danger he said the 96 million lawmakers want to return to taxpayers would cover the 40 million stirling requested for detention services and equipment upgrades for state prisons the s c house only approved 10 million in the state budget now under consideration by the state senate the surplus 96 million would also put a large dent in the 101 3 million needed to pay for deferred maintenance at state owned and maintained buildings or buy roughly 1 100 new school buses the state fleet has 5 600 buses with 752 of them 22 years and older a south carolina school bus carrying kindergarten students to a field trip caught on fire monday according to richland 2 school district or help clear a backlog of interstate interchange improvement and road widening projects specifically 96 million could pay for two new interstate interchanges two to three major road widening projects or one intersection improvement in each of the state s 46 counties according to the s c department of transportation a 2017 gas tax increase put the state on the right path to address a backlog of deferred maintenance on s c roads and bridges but it will not be able to fund the much needed road projects to deal with congestion in our rapidly growing state the transportation department said in a statement to the state cobb hunter vice chair of the house s budget writing committee introduced failed proposals that would have used the one time rebate to help further shore up the state s underfunded pension system and provide a one time bonus for all state employees the house approved budget includes 41 million to give 2 percent pay raises to nearly 32 000 state employees cobb hunter though said she worries that isn t enough to slow turnover at state agencies roughly 75 percent of those workers earn less than 41 000 a year a 2016 state study found the pay of state workers lags 15 percent behind that of other states and 18 percent behind the private sector over the last year about 5 000 state employees have left s c agencies for better pay elsewhere according to the s c state employees association and about 8 000 vacant position needed to be filled at state agencies as of december said executive director carlton washington certainly taxpayers would benefit from improved services of employees who feel they re being paid competitively washington said economic impact will be low while a one time rebate will provide some relief for consumers it will be modest said richard auxier a research associate at the nonpartisan tax policy center who tracks state tax policy for some lower income households however such as a single parent home the extra money would be helpful but of little economic benefit for the state as a whole it s hard to see how handing each person 50 will have a major effect on south carolina s economy auxier said the south carolina economy is very big and 50 while it may seem like a lot to some it s definitely not an economic growth strategy one time tax relief tends to be less effective than a more systemic approach for returning a budget surplus to taxpayers auxier said oregon and colorado for example have enacted triggers that provide automatic refunds if revenues exceed projections again these are more budget programs than rebate programs the rebates are a tool to keep revenue in check not stimulate the economy auxier said last year former wisconsin republican gov scott walker pushed for and signed into law a one time tax payout for families using a state budget surplus to give parents a 100 bonus per child critics and economists including auxier saw the move as a political stunt by walker in a tough re election bid with no clear long term economic purpose the washington post reported think of your school system your workforce and transportation system auxier said of investments that would have a more meaningful impact on the state economy a one time jolt in the form of 50 doesn t measure up to other economic growth strategies including more comprehensive and long term tax reform when you re thinking about economic growth you want to be thinking of these far larger ideas that impact business development not these one time infusions university of south carolina research economist joseph von nessen however argues offering rebates from new money flowing into the state including a 61 million lottery jackpot windfall would generate new economic activity that would not exist otherwise typically taxpayers will spend it on a number of consumer goods in a variety of retail sectors von nessen said that generates a ripple effect in general for every dollar of new consumer spending in south carolina an additional 0 60 is generated in economic activity through the multiplier effect for a total of 1 60 the impact is relatively small but it s nice to have it s an extra tank of gas for each taxpayer von nessen said it is going to generate a positive ripple effect for south carolina and positive economic impact
march 25 2010 author editorial board anu it s nearly a year since the malaysian people overwhelmingly cast aside the domineering divisive and corruption riddled government of najib razak for an alternative led by mohamad mahathir that promised renewed focus on the people s interests the new pakatan harapan government undertook to restore good governance raise the bar for ministers and civil servants recover embezzled funds and deliver them back to malaysians as cost of living relief translating rhetoric into action has thus far proven an uphill battle for an inexperienced government accustomed to life in opposition it s struggling to turn the vision into concrete reforms as it tries to navigate a hostile upper house and entrenched vested interests progress has been confined to a handful of easy wins and the multiplication of committees to continue decades old debates about well understood policy failings malaysians are becoming restless for the government to deliver on the promise of a new malaysia that secures livings standards regardless of ethnicity efforts to deconcentrate centralised power structures and break up state monopolies are central to reinvigorating the economy this will enable more effective governance and help tackle endemic corruption malaysia s federal government commands over 88 per cent of total government revenue and expenditure the share is closer to 50 per cent in federations like australia and the united states leaving almost 170 states and local authorities with limited resources to address local needs imperious policymaking from the administrative capital of putrajaya coupled with non elected local governments bedevil the effective delivery of local services including law enforcement education and healthcare this week s lead article by wing thye woo argues that rowth requires state governments that are empowered to plan and implement their own development strategies this would require a significant shift from the highly political allocation of development finance that penalised opposition led states under the former government government linked corporations glcs dominate the malaysian economy and that needs to change glcs command a majority share of market capitalisation and key sectors of the economy including natural resources utilities construction and finance policies that reinforce glc dominance stifle innovative and dynamic small and medium enterprises and competitiveness as woo says glcs may perform well in theory but they don t in practice officials inevitably use them for political patronage and personal corruption glcs are political creatures not economic instruments downsizing the state related sector through privatisation is necessary for economic efficiency political accountability and income equality the government has acknowledged the problem but has been tentative in its approach to this critical reform its first substantive policy announcements and budget provided a major setback reinforcing the role of glcs in ethnic malay development strategies and increasing government dependence on glc dividends it s unclear whether the government now has the clout and political fortitude to pursue a privatisation and competition agenda decentralisation is more than just government ownership and power sharing it encompasses a shift in the mentality of government from one underpinned by heavy handed direction to one of empowerment this requires the creation of institutional and regulatory environments that empower people to shape the policies that affect them private business and entrepreneurship to fuel the engine room of economic growth and all levels of government to deliver an enabling environment in which private actors flourish empowerment means replacing ethnic discrimination with inclusive approaches to policy making lifting up all low income households it means constructing a tax and transfer system that reduces rather than perpetuates inequality and cost of living pressures positively reshaping the social contract between taxpayers and government and it requires liberating the education system from the mechanistic dictatorial one size fits all approach that has prioritised a one eyed conception of nation building over the development of inquisitive and adaptable minds effective governance starts with a recognition that meaningful reforms may not please everyone but if done well can benefit all it requires the strength of conviction to stay the course in the face of interest group pressures avoiding discouraging u turns like abandoning intentions to sign the united nations international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination it entails more than a solitary sugar tax to raise funds for development and social welfare when the tax revenue share of gdp is a third of the oecd average and it requires delivering substantive reforms to education in the light or in spite of next month s special task force report the government s recent by election defeat in semenyih provides a wake up call that its support among middle class malaysians depends on improving its performance not on disparaging its predecessor that means harnessing the electorate s heightened expectations towards charting a more prosperous course for the economy governance and for the malaysian people the eaf

ohio lawmakers are now considering several legislative proposals that would increase the state s motor fuel tax rates the initial proposed tax hike from gov mike dewine s 7 4 billion two year transportation budget would increase the state gas tax from 28 cents per gallon to 46 cents if adopted the rate increase would move ohio from the state with the 29th highest gas tax to the fifth highest the new rate would go into effect july 1 and increase with inflation each year beginning in july 2020 the budget estimates the new tax would raise an estimated 1 2 billion a year with 480 million going to local government projects tying any tax rate to a commodity price or the consumer price index cpi which is calculated by the u s bureau of labor statistics would be problematic and make politicians and regulators less accountable when tax changes occur even worse because the cost of transportation is one of the measures used in calculating the cpi indexing the gas tax would contribute to higher prices by placing upward pressure on the very measures used to determine the tax rate both houses of the legislature made severe cuts to dewine s proposed hikes the house proposal reduced the planned gas tax hike to 10 7 cents per gallon which would be phased in over two years the house plan would commence with a 7 cent increase on october 1 the house proposal would also dramatically increase the diesel tax which would ultimately rise by 20 cents over a three year period and it would eliminate dewine s proposed 200 fee on electric vehicles and 100 fee on hybrids it would not index the rate in the future the senate version of the proposal would cut dewine s proposed rates even further while also equalizing the gas and diesel rates this version would increase the tax rate by 6 cents per gallon the senate proposal would create an estimated 872 million per year in new tax revenue increasing the gas tax will simply result in the same revenue issues as fuel efficiency and electric hybrid car usage continues to increase the rise of fuel efficient cars has decreased motor fuel tax coffers and disproportionately shifted the transportation tax burden to low income drivers a group that typically owns older less fuel efficient vehicles in several states the gas tax has become increasing inefficient with revenue falling far short of estimated goals this has left a deficit that legislatures are struggling to fill increasing what has proven to be a failing tax is not the answer in 2015 daniel vock writing for governing analyzed state gas tax data reported to the u s census bureau and found two thirds of state fuel taxes failed to keep up with inflation leading to dramatic reductions in fuel tax related revenue wendell cox and ronald utt argue gas taxes have a significantly greater detrimental effect on lower and middle income families than they do on the wealthy and americans for prosperity estimates lower gas prices amount to approximately 100 in additional spendable income per month for an average family even worse a tax hike would raise prices on goods and services throughout the economy because virtually all consumer goods are transported using gasoline powered vehicles in fact nearly 70 percent of all freight transported annually in the united states accounting for manufactured and retail goods worth 671 billion is transported by truck according to truckinfo net businesses will simply pass these added costs on to consumers instead of raising taxes ohio legislators should explore modern and efficient ways to fund road construction and traffic infrastructure such as privatizing roads and establishing toll systems switching to an all electronic tolling system would be a cost effective way to generate revenue while providing a fairer system for taxpayers electronic tolling would also remove much of the administrative bloat created by older systems that relied on toll operators creating more tolls would also address many of the new problems created by the greater number of fuel efficient and electric vehicles on america s roadways gas powered and electric cars pay the same toll rates which means lawmakers wouldn t need to impose a separate fee for electric cars to make up for the disparity created by a gas tax according to the reason foundation all electronic tolling aet has already demonstrated that its collection costs are match or exceed gas tax revenues reason found that the net collection costs of an aet operation is roughly 5 percent of the revenue collected for a 5 toll or about 8 percent for a 2 toll one reform that merits consideration is limiting the use of gas tax dollars to transportation projects wasteful spending is an issue that has long plagued transportation funding bloat inflated labor costs through prevailing wage laws and project labor agreements and inefficient bureaucratic agencies often inflate the cost of new infrastructure projects far above initial estimates while the senate bill is an improvement over dewine s original proposal any gas tax should be offset by tax cuts elsewhere or else the total tax burden on taxpayers will increase ohio should consider for instance cutting the state s income or property tax rates the following documents provide additional information about how motor fuel taxes are applied and the impact they have on state economies dispelling the myths toll and fuel tax collection costs in the 21st century in this reason foundation policy study daryl s fleming examines all electronic tolling its basic operations plan and business model the principal factors affecting toll collection costs and a number of reforms states can make to reduce the cost of toll collection the buckeye institute policymakers must maintain user

tom barton the state columbia with 96 million south carolina could purchase 1 100 new school buses build two interstate interchanges or provide a one time bonus for state employees worth five percent of their salaries or state legislators could give it back to taxpayers who could buy what amounts to a tank of gas and a fast food lunch that second option to return 96 million in extra state money to every s c taxpayer in a flat 50 rebate check is gaining steam south carolina has nearly 1 billion in new money to play with in next year s budget most of that money has been set aside to pay for rising education pension and health care costs and raises for state employees including teachers among other priorities republican state legislators say those same lawmakers say the rest of the new money 96 million should go back into taxpayers pockets when you look at one billion new dollars in south carolina s economy to take 10 percent of that revenue and return it back to the taxpayers i think is a good thing said house majority leader gary simrill r york it s both symbolic and a goodwill gesture back to the people of south carolina who worked hard to fill the state s coffers not even a drop in the bucket republican gov henry mcmaster first proposed the idea of a rebate in his executive budget in january which called for returning 200 million to taxpayers we keep telling the taxpayers that our jobs in state government is to find ways to save money to spend money wisely and whenever we can return their tax money mcmaster said at the time this is the right year to make good on that promise and return that money to the citizens it s not an uncommon request especially coming from gop leaders who campaign on promises to keep government lean and taxes low the state s economic and population growth has meant more money flowing into the state s coffers each year and more money to spend republican lawmakers supporting the rebate say struggling south carolinians would benefit from it regardless of the size of the check anyone who paid state income taxes in 2018 would receive a 50 check in the mail from s c department of revenue it moves the needle in a family that is struggling who works every day to put food on the table simrill said but critics of giving that extra money back to taxpayers argue the new money is needed to provide services to a growing population in a state that a decade ago suffered massive recession era budget cuts and is still recovering democrats say the tax refund will do little to move the needle in a state where persistently low pay for teachers and state employees has led to schools and agencies struggling to hold on to talented employees and fill vacancies opponents of giving the refund also say the money would be better spent on employee bonuses and a backlog of deferred road bridge prison and state building upgrades the economy also won t see much of a boost from returning 96 million to consumers so they can spend it consumer spending in the state totaled more than 169 billion in 2017 according to the u s bureau of economic analysis it s not even a drop in the bucket state rep gilda cobb hunter d orangeburg said a one time shot of 50 is not going to have any permanent impact and all it does is allow politicians to thump their chest and say oh look at us didn t we do good when in reality all we are doing is make ourselves feel better the millions of dollars cobb hunter and other democrats contend could help shore up chronic funding woes at state agencies that would lead to improved safety and services to south carolinians for example one year after a deadly riot at lee correctional institution where seven inmates died s c prisons still lack modern equipment and standard safety features such as automatic locks prison staff currently must manually lock and unlock cell doors which takes up the majority of their day corrections director bryan stirling said currently if there ever was a serious fire at a prison it would be difficult for staff to evacuate all inmates from danger he said the 96 million lawmakers want to return to taxpayers would cover the 40 million stirling requested for detention services and equipment upgrades for state prisons the s c house only approved 10 million in the state budget now under consideration by the state senate the surplus 96 million would also put a large dent in the 101 3 million needed to pay for deferred maintenance at state owned and maintained buildings or buy roughly 1 100 new school buses the state fleet has 5 600 buses with 752 of them 22 years and older a south carolina school bus carrying kindergarten students to a field trip caught on fire monday according to richland 2 school district or help clear a backlog of interstate interchange improvement and road widening projects specifically 96 million could pay for two new interstate interchanges two to three major road widening projects or one intersection improvement in each of the state s 46 counties according to the s c department of transportation a 2017 gas tax increase put the state on the right path to address a backlog of deferred maintenance on s c roads and bridges but it will not be able to fund the much needed road projects to deal with congestion in our rapidly growing state the transportation department said in a statement to the state cobb hunter vice chair of the house s budget writing committee introduced failed proposals that would have used the one time rebate to help further shore up the state s underfunded pension system and provide a one time bonus for all state employees the house approved budget includes 41 million to give 2 percent pay raises to nearly 32 000 state employees cobb hunter though said she worries that isn t enough to slow turnover at state agencies roughly 75 percent of those workers earn less than 41 000 a year a 2016 state study found the pay of state workers lags 15 percent behind that of other states and 18 percent behind the private sector over the last year about 5 000 state employees have left s c agencies for better pay elsewhere according to the s c state employees association and about 8 000 vacant position needed to be filled at state agencies as of december said executive director carlton washington certainly taxpayers would benefit from improved services of employees who feel they re being paid competitively washington said economic impact will be low while a one time rebate will provide some relief for consumers it will be modest said richard auxier a research associate at the nonpartisan tax policy center who tracks state tax policy for some lower income households however such as a single parent home the extra money would be helpful but of little economic benefit for the state as a whole it s hard to see how handing each person 50 will have a major effect on south carolina s economy auxier said the south carolina economy is very big and 50 while it may seem like a lot to some it s definitely not an economic growth strategy one time tax relief tends to be less effective than a more systemic approach for returning a budget surplus to taxpayers auxier said oregon and colorado for example have enacted triggers that provide automatic refunds if revenues exceed projections again these are more budget programs than rebate programs the rebates are a tool to keep revenue in check not stimulate the economy auxier said last year former wisconsin republican gov scott walker pushed for and signed into law a one time tax payout for families using a state budget surplus to give parents a 100 bonus per child critics and economists including auxier saw the move as a political stunt by walker in a tough re election bid with no clear long term economic purpose the washington post reported think of your school system your workforce and transportation system auxier said of investments that would have a more meaningful impact on the state economy a one time jolt in the form of 50 doesn t measure up to other economic growth strategies including more comprehensive and long term tax reform when you re thinking about economic growth you want to be thinking of these far larger ideas that impact business development not these one time infusions university of south carolina research economist joseph von nessen however argues offering rebates from new money flowing into the state including a 61 million lottery jackpot windfall would generate new economic activity that would not exist otherwise typically taxpayers will spend it on a number of consumer goods in a variety of retail sectors von nessen said that generates a ripple effect in general for every dollar of new consumer spending in south carolina an additional 0 60 is generated in economic activity through the multiplier effect for a total of 1 60 the impact is relatively small but it s nice to have it s an extra tank of gas for each taxpayer von nessen said it is going to generate a positive ripple effect for south carolina and positive economic impact
sarai nietvelt a general doctor from belgium interacts with a chinese nurse in the foreign funded united family hospital in shanghai on october 19 2018 xinhua on march 15 the second session of the 13th national people s congress china s top legislature adopted the country s first foreign investment law to promote protect and manage foreign investment in the changed circumstances the new law which will take effect on january 1 2020 is expected to enhance the confidence of foreign funded enterprises in china the law eliminates the case by case approval system and makes fundamental changes to the foreign investment management system which is expected to promote all round opening up and bring a legal guarantee for a new open economic system it states that foreign investment shall be managed according to the system of pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list government policies supporting enterprise development will apply equally to them and they will be on par with domestic enterprises regarding participation in standardization work and government procurement activity the law cracks down on extra legal curbs on foreign investment governments and relevant departments at all levels are required to formulate foreign investment related regulatory documents in accordance with laws and regulations there are also provisions that they may not undermine foreign invested enterprises lawful rights or impose obligations in violation of law and shall not set market entry and exit conditions or interfere or influence foreign invested enterprises normal business activities in violation of law in addition the law stresses improving investment related services and simplifying management procedures demonstrating the government s commitment to creating a fair and equitable market mechanism and providing an open and transparent investment environment a phased approach china s current legal system to manage foreign investment√¢ consisting of the law on chinese foreign equity joint ventures the law on non equity joint ventures and the law on wholly foreign owned enterprises√¢ was put in place in the initial phase of reform and opening up that started in 1978 foreign investment projects are subject to administrative approval and normally enjoy preferential treatment after it joined the world trade organiza tion in 2001 china focused on developing its legal system in line with international standards and the laws and regulations on foreign investment were amended substantially still the three laws which will be replaced by the foreign investment law are not in line with the company law and the contract law that were amended in 2018 since the global financial crisis in 2008 the united states and other developed countries have accelerated negotiations on free trade agreements and come up with new rules of global trade and investment china needs to restructure the domestic economic system and creates new driving forces through a higher level of opening up as its economy has shifted from high speed to high quality growth a new round of opening up started in 2013 focusing on establishing pilot free trade zones ftzs the china shanghai pilot ftz was established the same year and china began to explore a pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system for managing foreign investment after a negative list was implemented in the shanghai ftz which specifies the sectors off limits to foreign investors relevant laws on foreign investment management were suspended within the zone for a three year trial period on january 19 2015 the ministry of commerce mofcom published the draft foreign investment law to solicit public feedback and in the following year the pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system was expanded across china based on the experience of pilot ftzs and trial reforms in the same year mofcom issued interim policies specifying that foreign funded enterprises no longer need approval to invest in areas not designated in the negative list in june 2018 a shortened negative list for foreign investment came into effect containing just 48 items down from the 63 in the previous version the new negative list the special administrative measures on access to foreign investment was jointly released by mofcom and the national development and reform commission in november 2018 president xi jinping gave his assurance at the first china international import expo in shanghai that china will speed up new foreign investment legislation fully implement the pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system and develop a world class business environment as china is shifting from opening up based on the flow of commodities and production factors to liberalization of rules and systems the case by case approval system in the original foreign investment laws fails to meet the needs of the new open economic system and wider opening up there is a need for a more favorable legal environment for institutional openness the new law meets that need creating a more transparent stable and predictable policy environment for foreign investors doing business in china global direct investment has shrunk with the rise of trade and investment protectionism china s original advantages for attracting investment have been weakened by the rising cost of domestic labor and other factors besides there are higher demands on china s investment environment such as opening up more sectors treating foreign investors on par with domestic enterprises strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights and banning forced technology transfer faced with these considerations china has striven to follow international standards by opening up wider enhancing government services and streamlining approval procedures and improving its business environment according to the world bank s doing business 2018 report china s ranking in the ease of doing business index improved from 78th to 46th last year against the sharp decline in global direct investment china maintained steady growth with the paid in amount reaching a record high at 134 97 billion in 2018 singapore accounted for 53 4 percent of the chinese mainland s total foreign investment a year on year increase of 10 6 percent the investment went to industrial parks including demonstration projects such as the suzhou industrial park in east china s jiangsu province that began as a bilateral project with singapore and the sino singapore tianjin eco city in north china besides capital singapore also exports advanced management expertise to china investment from european union countries maintained rapid growth in 2018 their investment amounted to 11 86 billion up 35 percent year on year with china opening up its financial healthcare and education sectors british investment registered strong growth with a total value of 3 89 billion increasing 159 3 percent year on year britain has become the fifth largest source of foreign investment for china improving from ninth place in 2017 the adoption of the foreign investment law reflects china s resolve to widen opening up and provide a more fair open and institutionalized business environment based on the rule of law that favors long term development of foreign funded enterprises notably it will promote utilization of high quality overseas capital technologies and professionals on a larger scale and give fuller play to resources from the domestic and international markets to ensure steady growth of

america s big superstar cities pull away from the rest of the country the former industrial hubs and rural towns left behind in today s tech driven economy are doing whatever they can to compete and it isn t always healthy the contest to host amazon s second headquarters epitomized their problem desperate for tech cachet and tens of thousands of jobs cities from albany to fresno stepped forward in many cases by offering subsidies and tax breaks they could barely afford even then amazon anointed the thriving washington d c suburbs and initially new york city as its winners as i and my brookings institution colleagues mark muro and bill galston noted in a recent report the u s economy suffers from a stark geographic divide america s largest cities places such as new york seattle and san francisco have accounted for 75 percent of the nation s employment growth since 2015 geographic inequality warps our politics the counties that voted for donald trump in 2016 account for barely more than a third of the nation s gdp past presidents and congresses weren t shy about singling out the most troubled communities and directing federal help toward them during the great depression franklin d roosevelt identified the entire south as the nation s no 1 economic problem and created agencies such as the tennessee valley authority and the rural electrification administration to address the needs of its most isolated communities in the 1960s and 70s when central cities were seen as the locus of economic distress successive administrations tried to arrest the decline of urban centers today the notion that washington should help poor people not poor places to the point of urging people in declining areas to move has become conventional wisdom with the exception of the modest opportunity zones a provision of the recent tax law that allows lighter capital gains taxation for investors in certain troubled areas place specific aid has fallen out of favor but troubled communities don t just give up left to their own fate state and local policy makers often end up shoveling money at companies in the hope of attracting future investment it isn t working for today s left behind communities to bounce back the federal government has to act each year state and local governments spend tens of billions of dollars on incentives directed toward individual businesses confronting political pressure to turn around the local economy state and local leaders feel compelled to make these offers and companies that don t seek them are leaving money on the table but the results are disappointing by almost any standard wisconsin alone offered the taiwanese electronics company foxconn more than 4 5 billion to create 13 000 new jobs in the state according to a recent bloomberg investigation the company is unlikely to create the jobs promised in the wisconsin valley meanwhile executives have flip flopped on whether a majority of the jobs created will be in production or research and development instead of fueling a midwestern manufacturing renaissance wisconsin is stuck with a company it can no longer trust elsewhere kansas and missouri spent years fighting a border war by collectively forgoing an estimated 217 million in taxes they succeeded in poaching companies from each other within the kansas city metro region without creating any new jobs that wouldn t have otherwise arisen when incentives do bring new jobs to a region most go not to the local unemployed but to workers who migrate to the area and as states and localities direct taxpayer dollars toward incentives to lure employers to the region funding dries up for education workforce development and infrastructure factors that help determine whether a place declines or thrives federal policy can and should discourage this race to the bottom a 100 percent federal tax on incentives and subsidies an idea put forward by former delaware governor jack markell would discourage communities from offering them at all but giveaways are only the symptom of a larger problem small and midsize communities face distinct and growing disadvantages relative to superstar cities and they need the federal government s help to deal with those obstacles tellingly amazon s hq2 search all but ruled out smaller cities its request for proposals noted a strong preference for metro areas with more than 1 million residents theoretically advances in communication technology should free companies to set up shop and workers to live in small cities and towns with low costs of living in practice internet service is often slow in rural areas if it s available at all should the federal communications commission fast track its goal of achieving universal broadband in the united states at affordable rates left behind places will disproportionately benefit small and midsize communities also suffer from a lack of business financing as the banking industry has consolidated many communities far removed from the nation s financial centers have become capital deserts where local entrepreneurs cannot find the money to launch and expand their businesses many big banks have stopped issuing business loans below 100 000 a problem for small borrowers congress should pursue reforms that improve data on small business financing to reduce the high transaction costs of small business lending and lift the current cap on small business lending by credit unions so that local businesses can generate jobs and build wealth in their communities worst of all small and midsize cities have trouble fostering tech savvy workforces the problem is self reinforcing many people with advanced digital skills gravitate to larger cities with many potential employers and new employers arise in places with deep reserves of tech savvy workers the federal government could help underserved communities by investing in computer science training and creating a national information network to match tech firms looking to expand to places outside today s tech hubs but beyond setting policies that target specific problems we also need to be willing to invest heavily in a few places instead of telling laid off workers to move to boston or dallas muro and rob atkinson of the information technology and innovation foundation want the government to cultivate growth poles smaller urban hubs with the potential to become economic anchors for left behind regions by beefing up universities transportation systems and economic development initiatives in places such as roanoke virginia and salem oregon the federal government can help these growth poles attract new employers and draw workers from the left behind communities around them the federal government hasn t attempted interventions on this scale in some time the prevailing view has been that any interference with today s winner take all version of urbanism that is anything that keeps workforce talent and highly productive firms from concentrating themselves in the same cities would be economically inefficient not even the congestion and high cost of living that define superstar cities have been enough to make companies seek employees and office sites in lower profile places amid a public backlash in new york city amazon backed off its plans to build part of its hq2 there yet instead of showering

london march 25 stock markets slid today with asia taking the heaviest hit as investors took flight on mounting fears of a sharp global economic slowdown advertisement investors shrugged off news that an investigation found no evidence of collusion between us president donald trump s election campaign and russia on currency markets the british pound faced fresh selling pressure with prime minister theresa may s political future hanging in the balance as she looks to push her brexit deal through parliament for a third time each week in the brexit saga promises to be a crunch week and despite suggestions to the contrary it seems unlikely that even a promise by the prime minister to resign will get her deal over the line noted ig analyst chris beauchamp advertisement the country is simultaneously bored of brexit and desperate for a resolution dealers have meanwhile been spooked by growing evidence of a slowdown after a broad based rally since the start of the year that was built on hopes for china us trade talks and a more dovish federal reserve concerns over the health of the global economy heat up at a rapid pace said analyst jameel ahmad at traders fxtm advertisement in europe london stocks lost 0 6 per cent by midday while frankfurt and paris each shed 0 3 per cent eurozone losses were capped by the closely watched ifo index that showed recovering confidence among germany s business leaders in march after six months of decline miserable session tokyo s main stocks index was hammered 3 0 per cent while hong kong and shanghai both dived two per cent as concerns festered also over a possible recession in the united states dealers said despite a miserable session for asia european markets are managing to avoid heavy losses added beauchamp the risk off mood at the end of last week seemed dramatic and was perhaps justified given the sudden shift in the economic outlook but a better reading from the german ifo index has provided some reason for optimism us and european equities had tumbled friday as the yield on 10 year treasury bonds fell below those for three month notes the first time this had happened since before the global financial crisis this so called inverted yield curve shows investors are more willing to buy long term debt usually considered higher risk as they consider the short term outlook more risky this development will psychologically encourage further anxiety and rocket fears that the global economy is heading for another downturn if recent economic releases across the globe have not already provided indications that the downturn has arrived added analyst ahmad the yield curve is closely watched since it has inverted prior to recessions in recent decades the rush to the 10 year us bond market followed weak manufacturing data out of the us eurozone giant germany and france on friday that came days after the fed s announcement that it was unlikely to lift interest rates this year owing to unease about the us and global economy key figures around 1200 gmt london ftse 100 down 0 6 per cent at 7 165 57 points frankfurt dax 30 down 0 3 per cent at 11 333 39 paris cac 40 down 0 3 per cent at 5 253 48 euro stoxx 50 down 0 3 per cent at 3 297 24 tokyo nikkei 225 down 3 0 per cent at 20 977 11 close hong kong hang seng down 2 0 per cent at 28 523 35 close shanghai composite down 2 0 per cent at 3 043 03 close new york dow down 1 8 per cent at 25 502 32 close pound dollar down at us 1 3192 from us 1 3209 at 2100 gmt on friday euro pound up at 85 79 pence from 85 59 pence euro dollar up at us 1 1315 at us 1 1302 dollar yen up at 110 12 yen from 109 92 yen oil brent crude down 22 cents at us 66 81 per barrel oil west texas intermediate down 28 cents at us 58 76 afp
introduction two years ago i started reading seeking alpha and got intrigued by building a passive income stream by investing into dividend paying stocks while being a chartered accountant taught me how to read company reports i√¢ m not a √¢ hardcore√¢ trader that needs to see a result within a certain time period i have time on my side and try to invest in business i understand i always enjoy seeing other contributors sharing their progress in reaching retirement goals so i decided to do the same forcing myself to track my portfolio more thoroughly than i otherwise would and questioning whether my current approach makes sense current situation i√¢ m 26 years old working as an accountant and living in ireland because of the mostly american audience on seeking alpha some issues i describe might not apply to you especially regarding withholding tax but i hope you can still find interest in the portfolio ireland√¢ s tax laws feature the personal retirement and savings account prsa which similar to iras or 401k in the usa allow to deduct contributions to the account from taxable income and not incur any tax on capital gains until the retiree draws down from his account being under 30 i can get tax relief on contributions equalling 15 of my earnings investments in this account are in global index funds as my portfolio is in usd my returns might differ from a us investor√¢ s return based on the exchange rates i will therefore report both the performances incl excl of exchange rate movements it is the portfolio in my regular investment account i want to share with seeking alpha and see if i√¢ m able to beat the performance of my retirement account i know even if i succeed with that i√¢ ll never make up the hefty 40 tax relief on contributions but it should still be fun i try to do regular contributions to the portfolio but the primary focus is maximising contributions into my prsa so the contribution here might differ from month to month portfolio strategy loving the concept of dividend growth i will only invest into dividend paying stocks i invest a large part of the portfolio into reits but i try to balance high yield slow growth with lower yield higher growth stocks i√¢ m aware that i have a concentration risk as my 5 largest positions make up 48 of my total portfolio i√¢ ll be directing future contributions towards other holdings to reduce the percentage share of the largest holdings in terms of companies to invest in i look for two things a stable business model product market i understand and where i have confidence in the future prospects growing fcf since my assumed holding period is 30 years before i retire i try to buy at fair prices but not necessarily postponing the buy hoping to catch another drop the main ratio i look at to make my buy decision is the dividend yield which i want to be in the upper third of the 10 year range while this approach might not work for everyone looking at a 30 year holding period i√¢ d rather miss the ideal entry point than miss out on a home run such as mastercard ma or visa v by waiting for lower entry points dividends are not automatically being reinvested but i will manually decide where to reinvest while understanding the risk of margin debt i am willing to use margin debt not more than 15 of my portfolio value only if the cash is available in my saving accounts if i see opportunities presenting i am at the upper end of my target range after i invested further money into the us canadian reits during the december january drop so at the moment any dividends or added contribution will go towards reducing the margin debt holdings my portfolio consists of the following holdings missing in this overview is the financial sector which i describe separately performance feb ytd since it is already mid march i checked the february ytd performance of my portfolio and then will update monthly going forward name sector closing value dividend income capital

over the same period so my portfolio has underperformed the market reits reits make up 40 of the portfolio value i√¢ m intrigued by the historical performance of the sector and my simple thinking is that the requirement for real estate will not disappear anytime soon i steer clear of companies in the mall and snf sectors since i√¢ m not comfortable with these areas and focus on residential reits and add smaller positions in specialized reits as diversification most of my reit positions performed admirably especially canadian apartment properties reit otc cdpyf and its irish subsidiary irish residential properties reit otcpk rshpf which i recommended here but gladstone land land turned out to be one of only two holdings in the red their latest earnings were somewhat disappointing but the need for farmland to feed the population will not disappear in the future the same logic applies to australian rural funds group otcpk rfndf which gained 6 excl fx so i√¢ m very happy to be invested in this sector tobacco the best performing sector was tobacco where i only have one holding more than half of imperial brands otcqx imbbf gains came from the british pound strengthening my total position in tobacco was too small though to move the needle for the whole portfolio imperial brands just reiterated their focus to push their vaping brand √¢ blu √¢ just before the fda in the usa announced increased scrutiny to vaping products imperial brands has a great dividend but i won√¢ t invest any additional money i might consider adding altria mo when fresh funds are available distillers vintners my distillers vintners position also benefited from the recovery of the british pound with diageo deo gaining 10 brown forman bf a showed a 2 7 gain this is a sector i√¢ m very confident in and i√¢ m planning to further invest in this sector food food sector benefited from the strong results of mowi otcpk mhgvy former marine harvest and the recovery in general mills gis unfortunately i only have small positions in these so the overall effect on my portfolio was negligible consumer staples main reason for my underperformance was my large allocation to the consumer staples sectors while pepsico pep performed well unilever√¢ s ul stagnant performance slowed total portfolio performance unilever is my oldest holding and i got lucky buying before kraft√¢ s khc failed takeover move so the total value of my unilever position ballooned i am concerned about the large allocation to it but i like its strong position in emerging markets and i am confident for the next 10 years for unilever financial the only outright negative sector was financial while blackstone bx and finnish bank nordea nrdef did well australian lender bendigo and adelaide bank otcpk bxrbf was a major drag i had a large position of which i already liquidated half in february and sold the other half in march i wrote a rather positive article back in august 2018 but although the banks cash earnings were good for the half year ended december 2018 the slowing interest rate hikes in the usa and signals from the reserve bank of australia made me reconsider my position and i will update my recommendation in a future article dividends in terms of dividend income received the first two months of the year are always slow i√¢ m looking forward to march where dividends should pick up speed closing i am curious to see how the year will play out for my portfolio with a conservative stance with large positions in residential reits and consumer staples i hope it will do well in a recession there will be monthly updates to track the future performance any comments recommendations or critical questions are most welcome
china has embraced the idea of defaults imposing some discipline on debtors in its bond market and some of the most troubled debtors are local governments financing vehicles so an lgfv default has long seemed on the cards but it just isn t happening moody s investors service thought the first one might come in 2017 almost two years later there have been some close calls including with a late payment by a unit owned by qinghai province on a dollar bond last month that caused ripples through the investment community but no default what it suggests is china s leadership isn t prepared for a borrower with a regional authority s imprimatur to renege on its principal triggering higher borrowing costs across a swath of the world s third largest bond market stepping in with official assistance when needed will help local authorities sustain the development spending key to holding up national growth the cost may be an even bigger future reckoning with bad debt
at the boao forum for asia bfa in china s southernmost province of hainan last year chinese president xi jinping announced that china will roll out broader and bolder reforms and further open up china s economy over the past year china has kept its promises on further reform and opening up with concrete deeds further reforms opening up in a keynote speech delivered at the opening ceremony of the annual bfa conference last april xi pledged a new round of reform and opening up measures he promised that china will significantly broaden market access create a more attractive investment environment strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights and take the initiative to expand imports in the following months china hosted a series of diplomatic and economic events including the shanghai cooperation organization qingdao summit the beijing summit of the forum on china africa cooperation and the first china international import expo ciie the ciie was attended by 172 countries regions and international organizations and more than 3 600 enterprises china s ministry of commerce said the second expo to be held later this year will feature larger exhibition area and be attended by more countries and enterprises besides during the just concluded two sessions a key annual event in china s political calendar china adopted its first unified foreign investment law which will become effective on jan 1 2020 beijing will introduce a series of regulations and documents in accordance with the foreign investment law to better protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors chinese premier li keqiang told a press conference after the conclusion of the legislative session calling the new law a sensible set of policies david dollar a senior fellow in the john l thornton china center at the brookings institution said it is definitely a step forward in the country s continued reform and opening up dollar said opening up more sectors would allow the entry of high quality imports and also increase competition so that chinese companies could improve which would ultimately benefit china s economic growth selcuk colakoglu director of turkish center for asia pacific studies said that the law enhances the protection of intellectual property rights ipr of foreign investors and makes international companies to invest more in china confidently delivering promises by holding the first ciie and opening up more sectors to foreign investment china has proved it will always honor what it has promised about 960 000 foreign invested enterprises had been set up in china with the accumulated fdi exceeding 2 1 trillion us dollars by the end of 2018 according to china s ministry of commerce colakoglu also a professor of international relations said the new law will allow foreign investors enjoy treatment no less favorable than that afforded to chinese investors at the stage of investment access according to the world bank china ranked 46th globally for ease of doing business in 2018 up from 78 in 2017 within this framework colakoglu noted that the foreign investment law will be a landmark arrangement that will open china s door wider to the outside world the belt and road initiative bri proposed by xi in 2013 to boost economic growth by improving the trade and infrastructure network connecting asia with europe africa and beyond is another manifestation of china s resolve to further open up over the past year more friends have joined in the initiative with an additional 50 plus countries and international organizations signing the cooperation documents raising the total number of such documents to over 150 during xi s recent state visit to italy the european country signed with china a memorandum of understanding mou on bri cooperation becoming the first group of seven nation to join the initiative i believe the initiative has great potential in terms of economic development and international cooperation it is a very interesting concept and a framework for a new type of multilateralism spurred by china said carola ramon berjano a member of argentina s council on international relations for countries like argentina that lacks the needed infrastructure to boost trade the bri is an attractive and relevant proposal said ramon berjano stressing that it will help the country achieve inclusive and sustainable development in the long run global benefits as china gradually advances the opening up in various sectors in accordance with the timetable announced at the bfa last year the world s second largest economy with its gdp now exceeding 90 trillion yuan about 13 4 trillion us dollars continues to contribute to global growth though china faced a complicated and challenging environment rarely seen in many years with the economy under new downward pressure the nation managed to accomplish main targets for economic and social development in 2018 li said in his government work report china is still in an important period of strategic opportunity for development and has ample resilience enormous potential and great creativity to unleash li noted according to data from the un conference on trade and development foreign direct investment fdi inflow to china has ranked first among developing countries for 27 consecutive years china did a great job to attract fdi to the country since 1979 gradual opening of the chinese domestic market has provided a sustainable development within a stable environment colakoglu said china s last four decades of transformation has attracted global attention and china is greatly sought by most nations for building engagements said swaran singh a professor at the school of international studies of the delhi based jawaharlal nehru university india there is increasingly acceptability today in china taking the lead in several regional and global initiatives he noted duncan freeman a research fellow at the college of europe in bruges belgium said china s opening up and reforms have been extremely important for the global economy for the past 40 years and it is even more so today when china has a very big economy when commenting on the global economic trend the expert said there are a certain number of challenges including those faced by the international economic system and the global growth for this reason china s commitment to ongoing reforms openness and sustaining its domestic growth is extremely important as a contribution not just to the maintenance of an open global economic system but to global growth he said xinhua reporters yi aijun in istanbul xiong maoling in washington hu xiaoming in new delhi and federico grandesso in brussels also contributed to the story
argentina s renovar programme has made the country a promising emerging market but now recession and a lack of grid capacity are starting to take hold argentina s surging wind industry has run into turbulence as the country s economic troubles make financing more difficult two years after the country launched its renewable energy programme developers in argentina are on a roll with new projects being added nearly every month the latest was genneia s 50mw villalonga wind farm in rio negro on 6 march a week earlier authorities cut the ribbons on the 125mw bicentenario site in santa cruz province owned by petrochemicals firm pcr by the end of next year the government expects to have added 5gw of capacity a major step towards its target of generating 20 of the country s electricity from renewables by 2025 argentina is one of the world s success stories in renewables said maximiliano morrone the government s director of renewable energy promotion argentina s growing energy needs and capacity factors reaching 50 on the windswept pampas have made it a hot destination not only for developers but also for manufacturers such as vestas which opened a hub and nacelle assembly plant outside buenos aires last november to meet more than 1 5gw worth of orders but the sector is now facing headwinds after argentina ran into one of its periodic economic crises last year the value of the argentinean peso plunged 50 against the us dollar as investors fretted over the government s ability to reduce the fiscal deficit forcing president mauricio macri to seek a record 57 billion bailout from the international monetary fund in december the country entered its third recession in five years as the government slashed public spending to meet the imf s tight macroeconomic targets projects already in development have been protected in part by guarantees backed by the inter american development bank put in place for just this kind of financial turbulence said morrone prohibitively expensive developers without financing in place have seen the cost of capital funding soar capital markets have largely closed their doors to argentina we re no longer sexy said ezequiel miraz√≥n energy utilities and mining leader at pwc argentina with interest rates in double digits and the country s credit default swap spread tripling during 2018 it has become prohibitively expensive to finance all but the most competitive wind and solar projects it s put at risk a significant number of projects that were unable to complete the necessary financing said doris capurro ceo of luft energ√≠a which developed the first wind farm to be built under the renovar programme of renewable energy tenders adding to the uncertainty is october s general election where economic turmoil high inflation and spending cuts could leave macri struggling to win a second term currently ahead in most polls is his predecessor cristina fern√°ndez de kirchner whose record of state intervention in the economy may further scare investors conscious of the dramatic deterioration in conditions since the first contracts were awarded the government is showing flexibility in february energy secretary gustavo lopetegui announced an extension of up to 12 months to the deadline by which projects awarded contracts under the second renovar tender must be online to qualify for the delay projects must agree to tighter criteria choosing two out of a 30 national content requirement a shorter supply contract or a lower installation incentive then in march the government announced a two month extension of the deadline to present offers under the third round of the renovar programme originally due at the end of the month even with the extra time some less attractive projects may disappear but the crisis is attracting a second wave of less risk averse investors which could acquire equity in existing projects on very attractive terms capurro said the government is keen to play down the difficulties facing the sector out of 6gw of renewable capacity contracted under the renovar programme or with private consumers more than 80 have been financed and are either operating or under construction morrone said this includes 57 out of 69 wind projects with contracts struggling grid a bigger hurdle facing the development of renewables is the lack of transmission capacity in argentina s transmission grid some lines are already operating close to capacity especially those linking regions with the greatest potential for renewables such as patagonia or the north west following delays in building the necessary infrastructure this year s third round tender focuses on smaller projects 500kw 10mw which can run on medium tension lines where the situation is less critical the government is working on a fourth tender for larger projects which could be launched in early 2020 morrone said but more larger scale projects can only be added once the government has tendered contracts to expand capacity on key routes

the nato war on yugoslavia which culminated in the 78 days bombing of historic cities and infrastructures as usual under atrocity propaganda and pretexts is on its 20th anniversary the grim anniversary is admirably recognized by science for peace members to remember and to prevent who knows what nato war crime next as humanitarian intervention from yugoslavia to iraq to libya where does it stop observe that trump is now seeking a nato alliance with bolsonaro brazil see image below to perhaps back the bombing of venezuela or any other society including the brazilian people not bowing to us led global corporate colonization socialist genocide is the unspeakable logic of the serial war crimes under international law so it is important to remember the long war of economic and financial destabilization that occurred over years before and after the bombing to destroy federal yugoslavia s market socialism in every workers control and social infrastructure it had evolved after 1945 to s olve the endless balkan ethnic wars of its past history this larger design is taboo to state us led genocide of any socialist society as covert state policy instead freedom and human rights is the reverse mask every time which is relentlessly dinned into people s heads in this way again and again the non stop succession of us international crimes under law is covered up into the present day so too federal yugoslavia once the envy of the world in democratic social progress was destroyed step by step its bonding social infrastructures were dismantled by unceasing all fronts us financial war in which nato bombing in 1999 was only the most evident event of the socialist genocide repressed witness of the killing of a multi cultural socialism below are excerpts from ottawa university professor of economics emeritus michel chossudovsky s long leading analysis which provides a minimalist through line of the effectively genocidal war against all not for profit institutions of a socialist society in which yugoslavia is a paradigm case the selected text excerpts below are from michel chossudovsky s 1996 article updated in 2002 published as a chapter in the globalization of poverty and the new world order global research montreal 2003 as heavily armed us and nato troops enforced the peace in bosnia the press and politicians alike portrayed western intervention in the former yugoslavia as a noble response to an outbreak of ethnic massacres and human rights violations in the wake of the november 1995 dayton peace accords the west was eager to touch up its self portrait as savior of the southern slavs and get on with the work of rebuilding the newly sovereign states but following a pattern set early on the plight of the balkans was promoted as the outcome of deep seated ethnic and religious tensions rooted in history 1 likewise much was made of the balkans power play and the clash of political personalities tudjman and milosevic are tearing bosnia herzegovina to pieces lost in the barrage of images and self serving analyses are the economic and social causes of the conflict the deep seated economic crisis which preceded the civil war had long been forgotten the strategic interests of germany and the us in laying the groundwork for the disintegration of yugoslavia go unmentioned as does the role of external creditors and international financial institutions in the eyes of the global media western powers bear no responsibility for the impoverishment and destruction of a nation of 24 million people thus yugoslavia s war ravaged successor states are left to the mercies of the international financial community as the world focused on troop movements and cease fires the international financial institutions were busily collecting former yugoslavia s external debt from its remnant states while transforming the balkans into a safe haven for free enterprise with a bosnian peace settlement holding under nato guns the west had in late 1995 unveiled a reconstruction program that stripped that brutalized country of sovereignty to a degree not seen in europe since the end of world war ii the genocide of market socialism the new constitution included as an appendix to the dayton accords handed the reins of economic policy over to the bretton woods institutions and the london based european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd the imf was empowered to appoint the first governor of the bosnian central bank who like the high representative shall not be a citizen of bosnia and herzegovina or a neighboring state it may not extend credit by creating money operating in this respect as a currency board while the central bank was in imf custody the london based ebrd heads the commission on public corporations which supervises since 1996 operations of all public sector enterprises in bosnia including energy water postal services telecommunications and transportation the ebrd president appoints the commission chair and is in charge of public sector restructuring i e the sell off of state and socially owned assets and the procurement of long term investment funds western creditors explicitly created the ebrd to give a distinctively political dimension to lending as the west proclaimed its support for democracy actual political power rests in the hands of a parallel bosnian state whose executive positions are held by non citizens western creditors have embedded their interests in a constitution hastily written on their behalf the neocolonization of bosnia was a logical step of western efforts to undo yugoslavia s experiment in market socialism and workers self management and to impose the dictate of the free market yugoslavia s success before system destabilization by us financial war multi ethnic socialist yugoslavia was once a regional industrial power and economic success in the two decades before 1980 annual gross domestic product gdp growth averaged 6 1 percent medical care was free the rate of literacy was 91 percent and life expectancy was 72 years 11 but after a decade of western economic ministrations and a decade of disintegration war boycott and embargo the economies of the former yugoslavia were prostrate their industrial sectors dismantled despite belgrade s non alignment and its extensive trading relations with the european community and the us the reagan administration had targeted the yugoslav economy in a secret sensitive 1984 national security decision directive nsdd 133 entitled us policy towards yugoslavia a censored version declassified in 1990 elaborated on nsdd 64 on eastern europe issued in 1982 the latter advocated expanded efforts to promote a quiet revolution to overthrow communist governments and parties while reintegrating the countries of eastern europe into a market oriented economy the us had earlier joined belgrade s other international creditors in imposing a first round of macroeconomics reform in 1980 shortly before the death of marshall tito that initial round of restructuring set the pattern secessionist tendencies feeding on social and ethnic divisions gained impetus precisely during a period of brutal impoverishment of the yugoslav population the economic reforms wreaked economic and political havoc slower growth the accumulation of foreign debt and especially the cost of servicing it as well as devaluation led to a fall in the standard of living of the average yugoslav the economic crisis threatened political stability it also threatened to aggravate simmering ethnic tensions these reforms accompanied by the signing of debt restructuring agreements with the official and commercial creditors also served to weaken the institutions of the federal state creating political divisions between belgrade and the governments of the republics and autonomous provinces a reaganomics arsenal ruled and throughout the 1980s the imf and world bank periodically prescribed further doses as the yugoslav economy slowly lapsed into a coma from the outset successive imf sponsored programs hastened the disintegration of the yugoslav industrial sector lunging to zero in 1987 88 and to a negative 10 percent growth rate by 1990 15 this process was accompanied by the piecemeal dismantling of the yugoslav welfare state with all the predictable social consequences debt restructuring agreements meanwhile increased foreign debt and a mandated currency devaluation also hit hard at yugoslavs standard of living shock therapy began in january 1990 although inflation had eaten away at earnings the imf ordered that wages be frozen at their mid november 1989 levels prices continued to rise unabated and real wages collapsed by 41 percent in the first six months of 1990 17 the imf also effectively controlled the yugoslav central bank its tight money policy further crippled the country s ability to finance its economic and social programs state revenues that should have gone as transfer payments to the republics went instead to service belgrade s debt with the paris and london clubs the republics were largely left to their own devices the economic package was launched in january 1990 under an imf stand by arrangement sba and a world bank structural adjustment loan sal ii the budget cuts requiring the redirection of federal revenues towards debt servicing were conducive to the suspension of transfer payments by belgrade to the governments of the republics and autonomous provinces in one fell swoop the reformers had engineered the final collapse of yugoslavia s federal fiscal structure and mortally wounded its federal political institutions by cutting the financial arteries between belgrade and the republics the reforms fueled secessionist tendencies that fed on economic factors as well as ethnic divisions virtually ensuring the de facto secession of the republics the imf induced budgetary crisis created an economic fait accompli that paved the way for croatia s and slovenia s formal secession in june 1991 crushed by the invisible hand the reforms demanded by belgrade s creditors also struck at the heart of yugoslavia s system of socially owned and worker managed enterprises by 1990 the annual rate of growth of gdp had collapsed to 7 5 percent in 1991 gdp declined by a further 15 percent industrial output collapsed by 21 percent 19 the restructuring program demanded by belgrade s creditors was intended to abrogate the system of socially owned enterprises the enterprise law of 1989 required abolishing the basic organizations of associated labor baol the latter were socially owned productive units under self management with the workers council constituting the main decision making body the 1989 enterprise law required the transformation of the boals into private capitalist enterprises with the worker s council replaced by a so called social board under the control of the enterprise s owners including its creditors 20 the assault on the socialist economy also included a new banking law designed to trigger the liquidation of the socially owned associated banks within two years more than half the country s banks had vanished to be replaced by newly formed independent profit oriented institutions 24 by 1990 the entire three tier banking system consisting of the national bank of yugoslavia the national banks of the eight republics and autonomous provinces and the commercial banks had been dismantled under the guidance of the world bank a federal agency for insurance and bank rehabilitation was established in june 1990 with a mandate to restructure and reprivatize restructured banks under world bank supervision 25 in less than two years the world bank s so called trigger mechanism under the financial operations act had led to the lay off of 614 000 out of a total industrial workforce of the order of 2 7 million the largest concentrations of bankrupt firms and lay offs were in serbia bosnia herzegovina macedonia and kosovo many socially owned enterprises attempted to avoid bankruptcy through the non payment of wages half a million workers representing some 20 percent of the industrial labor force were not paid during the early months of 1990 in order to meet the demands of creditors under the settlement procedures stipulated in the law on financial organizations real earnings were in a free fall social programs had collapsed with the bankruptcies of industrial enterprises unemployment had become rampant creating within the population an atmosphere of social despair and hopelessness shock therapy to take over natural resources in the wake of the november 1995 dayton accords western creditors turned their attention to yugoslavia s successor states yugoslavia s foreign debt had been carefully divided and allocated to the successor republics which were strangled in separate debt rescheduling and structural adjustment agreements 46 the consensus among donors and international agencies was that past imf macroeconomics reforms inflicted on federal yugoslavia had not quite met their goal and further shock therapy was required to restore economic health to yugoslavia s successor states the neocolonial administration imposed under the dayton accords and supported by nato s firepower had ensured that bosnia s future would be determined in washington bonn and brussels rather than in sarajevo western governments and corporations showed most interest in gaining access to strategic natural resources with the discovery of energy reserves in the region the partition of bosnia between the federation of bosnia herzegovina and the bosnian serb republika srpska under the dayton accords has taken on new strategic importance documents in the hands of croatia and the bosnian serbs indicate that coal and oil deposits have been identified on the eastern slope of the dinarides thrust retaken from krajina serbs by the us backed croatian army in the final offensives before the dayton accords bosnian officials had reported that chicago based amoco was among several foreign firms that subsequently initiated exploratory surveys in bosnia substantial petroleum fields also lie in the serb held part of croatia just across the sava river from tuzla the headquarters for the us military zone 55 exploration operations went on during the war but the world bank and the multinationals that conducted the operations kept local governments in the dark presumably to prevent them from acting to grab potentially valuable areas 56 with their attention devoted to debt repayment and potential energy bonanzas both the us and germany have devoted their efforts with 70 000 nato troops on hand to enforce the peace history repeats itself in patterns not events the pattern of criminal us destabilization and destruction of social states to loot them of their sovereign resources is the unseen history of the last century of the world yugoslavia provides the cornerstone example since the nazis inside europe with ukraine taken down since in the same pattern still taboo to see us led nato is the transnational war machine of the world

by ssemanda allawi commissioning of isimba hydro power station which increased the country s power capacity from 955mw to 1138 mw is a big breakthrough towards national economic growth the development means the cost of electricity will reduce and power outage challenge which affects businesses will also reduce the dam which was was constructed at a cost of 568m with the assistance of a 10 year loan from china s exim bank and 15 from ugandan government s energy fund will see the current cost of power reduce from 8cents pkwh to 5 cents per kwh making it the cheapest in the region this gives ugandans the opportunity to have an uninterrupted power supply as well an opportunity to connect more ugandans to hydropower grid which economists describe as one of the factors required to boost economic growth the development further puts uganda on the right track in regard to attaining the 17 united nations sustainable development goals sdgs by 2030 especially goal number 7 which calls for affordable and clean energy and goal 9 industry innovation and infrastructure therefore all efforts meant to support infrastructure development in uganda should be warmly welcomed for they really wish us well indeed after commissioning the power station president yoweri museveni tweeted i thank the chinese government through their exim bank that supported this project the chinese government are our and africa s reliable partners infrastructure projects such as hydropower dams roads as it s the case with entebbe expressway several other roads in different parts of the country and industrial parks which have been put up with chinese government support all will in short and long run contribute towards our national economic growth it is however important to note that while such infrastructural projects are needed to spur economic programs they are expensive and there are few development partners willing to support them with less or no conditions as other traditional western institutions such as world bank imf and their counterpart states often put stringent conditions on their funding hence ugandan government hailing beijing for supporting kampala s expensive infrastructure projects is very right indeed america s boston university s global development policy center s latest research indicates that the china development bank and china s export import bank of china now provide more financing to developing countries especially in africa more than the world bank this does not include chinese bilateral and multilateral development finance arrangements which the chinese government extends to developing countries via bilateral and regional development funds all over the world it is important to note that the world especially africa is still facing a shortage of funding especially infrastructure projects world bank and mckinsey global institute an american worldwide management consulting firm in 2018 report entitled bridging global infrastructure gaps infrastructure funding has considerably reduced unmet global infrastructure needs until 2030 top more than 3 3 trillion per year if they are to be conducted in a manner that is socially inclusive the report further notes that 60 of this must go to developing countries like uganda which china is doing sadly china s kindness and willingness to extend credit to african countries to support huge projects which the west seem not ready too rather than welcoming china s brotherly assistance to african countries the united states is mistakenly shunning chinese development finance around the globe last week america s assistant secretary of state for african affairs tibor nagy while addressing press in kampala criticised china for extending huge loans to african countries insinuating that african countries will fail to pay such loans and that china was receiving gushing praises yet the west s support receive less or no praises compared to china s while nagy is obsessed that china is extending infrastructure assistance to africa and other developing countries he doesn t mention that western led development finance from the bretton woods institutions such as world bank and its counterparts have reduced after being stagnant for decades secretary nagy also should acknowledge that global infrastructure facility an initiative for public private partnerships supported by the western dominated so called group of 20 g20 leading rich and developing nations and the world bank have raised 84 billions and committed just 37 million as opposed to china which has has negotiated close to 170 billion in bilateral and regional development funds including a whooping 60 billion pledge to african countries announced during the 2018 forum on china africa cooperation focac summit in beijing therefore because of the huge funding gaps particularly infrastructure which china is willing to support on basis of mutual benefit it is really natural that emerging economies and developing countries especially african countries are happily embracing chinese loans from international relations perspective an argument can be made that african countries prefer china s loans and assistance simply because china respects african countries and chinese assistance has no strings attached african countries are at liberty to invest such funds in projects they find more important to their people than western assistance which often comes with instructions on where to invest it western countries often give tough conditions such as demanding for very controversial policy reforms like privatization and deregulation of financial markets which many african countries have found to be burdensome indeed in west africa a study found that international monitory fund imf policy reforms the so called conditinalities forced governments to scale down fiscal space for investments in health in 16 countries which weakened health systems and exacerbated ebola outbreak stressing that every additional binding imf policy reform reduces government health expenditure per capita by 0 248 that said china is proving to african countries that it is a reliable partner while critics like secretary nagy continue to prophesize doom that african countries will default paying back chinese huge loans and therefore china is risking chinese investors have not abandoned africa on centrally western investors are fickle and retreat whenever such risks are raised to the centrally china has not given up on african countries and is really in it for the long haul this is a testimony that china is a reliable ally and deserves all praises nagy is accusing africa lastly in international relations there is a reason for every action or step taken it is therefore important to investigate why nagy and the west are disturbed with chinese development assistance to africa cui bono a concept used to identify beneficiaries especially in murder cases can help us to understand this well is it that they so much love china and don t want beijing to lose in the unfortunate event that african countries default is it that they so much love africa and would be touched if china decided to colonize africa as critics insinuate if chinese firms stop investing in africa wont western firms come in as chinese leader deng xiaoping who opened up china and started reforms that saw china start modernity path once noted it doesn t matter whether a cat is white or black as long as it catches mice africa also doesn t matter where development assistance is coming from provided it is not used to interfere in our domestic affairs or with conditions as chinese are doing such aid assistance is always welcome the writer is a phd candidate international relations diplomacy
gov jared polis stood in the greenlee elementary school library to announce that free all day kindergarten his no 1 campaign promise was on its way to reality every single child deserves a strong start the governor said late last week as he was flanked by lawmakers educators and students the current kindergarten system doesn t treat students equally he said what you get depends on chance where you live how much money you have polis s announcement came after the joint budget committee jbc set aside 185 million in next year s budget which he says is enough to fully pay for projected enrollment across the state but it took the jbc weeks to find room in the 30 billion state budget for the plan lawmakers say and it came at the expense of k 12 education repairs to government buildings and other state programs democrats consider to be underfunded the governor with the kindergarten request put pressure on every part of the budget said rep chris hansen a democrat from denver who serves on the joint budget committee so we re having to make some tough trade offs a revenue forecast released earlier this month projects a 1 billion plus surplus for the 2019 2020 fiscal year which begins in july due to continued economic growth despite the size of the surplus economists doubt it will be large enough to trigger refunds under the taxpayer bill of rights or tabor most of the 1 billion surplus is already spoken for on top of the 185 million for all day kindergarten budget writers want to spend 336 million on k 12 public schools which democrats say remain underfunded 230 million on transportation a dent in the multi billion dollar backlog and 121 million on higher education tuition which will hold tuition flat those expenditures combined with inflation and population growth and some smaller budget line items such as expanded mental health services eat up all but about 40 million of the surplus that 40 million will have to stretch far and wide democrats and the governor are discovering less than five months after they swept into office initiatives democrats promised during their campaigns including criminal justice reforms and efforts to expand health care and opioid use disorder treatment will be competing for cash universal kindergarten was one of the few polis pet programs the jbc funded but even so it gave him about 67 million less than he wanted he also asked for 13 million to expand public preschool slots for at risk children which the jbc made up of four democrats and two republicans did not approve in the first draft of the budget which is expected to be released as soon as today budget writers also denied the governor s requests for an additional 20 million to implement the colorado water plan to help avoid future water shortages 1 3 million to drive down the costs of prescription drugs 3 1 million to cover a paid family leave program for state employees and 11 million to move prisoners around the state withholding this funding could mean good news for democrats seeking funding for their own policy priorities such as school safety measures substance use disorder treatment and a state run paid family leave program for all employees funded mostly through employee and employer contributions initially but which could require general fund money initially there is a general recognition that the 40 million set aside will not cover all proposed legislation i think it forces us to prioritize a little bit about our major goals said rachel zenzinger a democrat from arvada who sits on the jbc the projected revenue surplus slightly less what lawmakers worked with last year was one reason polis and lawmakers were able to move ahead with free all day kindergarten but the economic boon may not last state economists forecast a cooling economy in colorado due to the waning influence of the federal tax cuts labor shortages and president donald trump s trade war with china this prospect has budget writers worried about starting new programs this year that might have to be cut in the event of a recession zenzinger said she is concerned the governor s new kindergarten program may cut into k 12 education funding in future years the state underfunds k 12 schools by about 672 million annually which is one reason why nearly half of public school districts are turning to a four day school week complicating matters is that much of any expected surplus in future years is already allocated the state may have to dish out hundreds of millions of dollars to the state pension plan known as pera beginning in the summer of 2020 medicaid is set to continue expanding and there s the possibility the state will have to begin making 250 million annual bond payments for transportation projects in an effort to free up some extra cash lawmakers are moving ahead with a plan to reform the tabor permanently the proposal would take taxpayer refunds and automatically channel them to k 12 and higher education and transportation budget aside democrats are working through internal divisions on a number of other issues an immigrant rights bill was killed before it was even introduced in part due to pushback from polis who has promised not to enact sanctuary policies which are loosely defined an effort to repeal the death penalty the passage of which seemed certain earlier this session is now in a holding pattern a bill that would provide people addicted to opioids a safe place to use and seek resources to get into treatment was also scuttled after several democrats wavered on the idea meanwhile democrats are also fending off the threats of recalls over a law that would have colorado join a national compact to elect the u s president using a national popular vote and bills to stiffen oil and gas regulations and establish a red flag law that would allow law enforcement to confiscate a person s firearms if a judge deems the person is a threat to themselves or others the senate approved the red flag bill on a voice vote late friday after democrats rejected several gop efforts to drastically alter the bill and stall debate sen owen hill a republican from colorado springs requested the journal which includes the day s notes motions and votes be read at length republicans have been trying to stall debate on a number of bills they oppose which could run out the clock at the end of the session earlier this session they invoked their right to have a 2 000 page bill read aloud at length democrats responded by using multiple computers to do the reading which cut down the time spent on the task from days to hours these stall tactics matter because the 120 day session ends on sine die or may 3 last year lawmakers wrapped up the budget just minutes before midnight on the last day this year lawmakers may plan a little extra time we have done the calculations it would take 20 hours to have the budget read at length zenzinger said i think we re gonna pass a budget

photo bob robinson it s no secret that mountain bikers will travel far to ride great trails we ve covered this thoroughly towns build trails mountain bikers travel to towns ride trails buy lots of beer and pizza after the ride businesses make money and the story goes on this isn t exactly a sustainable way of living for most of us though and the majority of a mountain biker s riding takes place close to where they live in fact this is imba s next big push if mountain biking can crown destinations that stand tall and proud then what can it do for our own cities imba s reasoning for the push on hometown trails statistics spell it out on their webpage about 63 of recreationists travel 10 miles or less to play 80 of americans live in urban areas and close to 90 of rides happen on what mountain bikers consider local trails which imba cites from singletracks imba also says that more trails mean a healthier community and a better quality of life community health these were the exact reasons the walton brothers started investing in a trail network in bentonville arkansas home of wal mart corporate headquarters and countless workers while it was their vision to have this great cycling culture and to bring people in it wasn t initially planned to do that says aimee ross bentonville is the home of wal mart and there are thousands of employees many of the vendors are based here and they also have employees they wanted to start providing a better quality of life for the people that live here while the economic benefits for mountain bike tourism destinations are well known by now what s not talked about as much is how building trails can improve residents health just as much as their economy in a huge study put together by the walton foundation a year ago they found that biking in northwest arkansas added about 86m in total health benefits to the local economy 79m of which are reflected in reduced mortality benefits according to the world health organization s health economic assessment tool they found about 7m in avoided health care costs also photo bob robinson the foundation determined avoided healthcare costs by estimating about 4 700 locals around northwest arkansas ride regularly at a moderate intensity level and do so frequently the study also found that biking in the region saved about ten lives per year by preventing conditions like diabetes and heart disease that are exacerbated by a sedentary lifestyle as the saying goes an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure but for businesses that are interested in saving health care costs associated with their employees by promoting biking it may be better stated that a dime of prevention is worth a dollar of cure while investing in a local trail network seems like a lot of money up front it appears to be worthwhile in the end trail incentives for one of the fastest growing cities in the nation boise has recognized mountain biking as a reason why people want to relocate there and the city is using it in certain cases to attract new employers historically boise has had a stake in the agriculture and food technology industries and is home to the simplot company founded by j r simplot who developed the frozen french fry now the city is also home to tech and startup companies like micron and paylocity when you look at the ages that are moving in it s definitely what you like to see from a workforce perspective says clark krause krause is the executive director of the boise valley economic partnership the organization offers assistance to businesses interested in relocating or starting in the boise area with the intent to oversee smart development and growth in boise part of that means that krause entertains business leaders when they visit boise to see if it s right for them occasionally that means taking clients on a mountain bike ride on the boise trails 200 miles of which krause says are accessible right from downtown and city neighborhoods he says this is one of the strongest selling points for businesses interested in moving mountain bikers in the boise foothills photo brent via flickr if we can then we close the deal recently he had a client who owns a fishing gear manufacturing company in the south come up to boise to consider relocating the business krause found out that the man and his wife both mountain bike so krause arranged to have a former pro take them out on the boise trails krause says he believes that ride influenced their decision to relocate tax incentives and government grants also make it easier for businesses relocating to boise there are tax breaks for companies that create new high wage jobs in idaho or build facilities that create jobs ideally there would be more government funding available to build even more trails to lure new residents but carlos matutes the executive director of southwest idaho mountain bike association swimba hopes that the influx of residents will result in more members and membership money soon he s seen places like salt lake city be more proactive in marketing their trails i m hoping that with the population growth and the more people that we re seeing on the trails we can change that we have a great trail network but it can be much better matutes has a few plans to draw new residents into swimba and increase membership dollars he wants to build an inclusive and diverse image which is challenging because he describes the boise community as mostly white the goal is to work with the nica leagues at local schools and engage the refugee population with mountain biking as a way to integrate with schoolmates swimba is working on a new skills park also and wants to build a bike library and a strider friendly trail to get kids started early getting the message out in vermont the message is more succinct the state has been steadily losing its population and the population as a whole is older which again from a workforce perspective isn t good these facts and this problem can no longer be ignored said new governor phil scott during his inaugural address and state of the state on jan 10 2019 just take our labor force as an example since 2009 our labor force has declined by about 15 000 riders in the killington bike park photo grant wieler in the public k 12 schools scott says they re educating 30 000 less students than they were in 1997 that means fewer people to grow up and support the vermont infrastructure local businesses and the state economy with fewer people paying into the state tax they ll be challenged to sustain government welfare and social programs or pay back the state s 4b debt multiple times throughout his address governor scott cited recreation as one of vermont s greatest strengths that s why the state started a remote worker grant in 2019 that rewards people interested in relocating to vermont and who also work remotely a grant of up to 5 000 that covers moving expenses remote worker expenses like computers and software or membership at co working spaces the program had over 3 000 inquiries after it launched the other incentive for people considering relocation to vermont a thriving recreation and mountain bike scene later in his speech governor scott talked about his visit to different towns and how employers have recruited new and young workers some more successfully than others a particular case caught scott s attention in lyndonville vt just outside of burke precision composites had no trouble filling positions even highly skilled positions like engineering kingdom trails vermont photo rob whelan now that got my attention said scott because just the week before i was at collins aerospace in vergennes and they said they were looking to hire 25 engineers but were struggling to do so what had precision composites done differently that ended with much different results they put a help wanted ad in a mountain biking magazine said scott the crowd mostly made up of local vermont government workers chuckled in unison at what a simple idea could do the point is we know people want to come here we just need to identify and reach those who do and if that works then cities in idaho and vermont could have a fairytale ending just like towns known for mountain bike tourism the question is can it steer an entire state s economy

by jonathan watts after water concrete is the most widely used substance on the planet but its benefits mask enormous dangers to the planet to human health and to culture itself in the time it takes you to read this sentence the global building industry will have poured more than 19 000 bathtubs of concrete by the time you are halfway through this article the volume would fill the albert hall and spill out into hyde park in a day it would be almost the size of china s three gorges dam in a single year there is enough to patio over every hill dale nook and cranny in england after water concrete is the most widely used substance on earth if the cement industry were a country it would be the third largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world with up to 2 8bn tonnes surpassed only by china and the us the material is the foundation of modern development putting roofs over the heads of billions fortifying our defences against natural disaster and providing a structure for healthcare education transport energy and industry concrete is how we try to tame nature our slabs protect us from the elements they keep the rain from our heads the cold from our bones and the mud from our feet but they also entomb vast tracts of fertile soil constipate rivers choke habitats and acting as a rock hard second skin desensitise us from what is happening outside our urban fortresses thank you for your feedback our blue and green world is becoming greyer by the second by one calculation we may have already passed the point where concrete outweighs the combined carbon mass of every tree bush and shrub on the planet our built environment is in these terms outgrowing the natural one unlike the natural world however it does not actually grow instead its chief quality is to harden and then degrade extremely slowly all the plastic produced over the past 60 years amounts to 8bn tonnes the cement industry pumps out more than that every two years but though the problem is bigger than plastic it is generally seen as less severe concrete is not derived from fossil fuels it is not being found in the stomachs of whales and seagulls doctors aren t discovering traces of it in our blood nor do we see it tangled in oak trees or contributing to subterranean fatbergs we know where we are with concrete or to be more precise we know where it is going nowhere which is exactly why we have come to rely on it this solidity of course is what humankind yearns for concrete is beloved for its weight and endurance that is why it serves as the foundation of modern life holding time nature the elements and entropy at bay when combined with steel it is the material that ensures our dams don t burst our tower blocks don t fall our roads don t buckle and our electricity grid remains connected solidity is a particularly attractive quality at a time of disorientating change but like any good thing in excess it can create more problems than it solves at times an unyielding ally at times a false friend concrete can resist nature for decades and then suddenly amplify its impact take the floods in new orleans after hurricane katrina and houston after harvey which were more severe because urban and suburban streets could not soak up the rain like a floodplain and storm drains proved woefully inadequate for the new extremes of a disrupted climate facebook twitter pinterest when the levee breaks the levee of the 17th street canal new orleans after it was breached during hurricane katrina photograph nati harnik ap it also magnifies the extreme weather it shelters us from taking in all stages of production concrete is said to be responsible for 4 8 of the world s co2 among materials only coal oil and gas are a greater source of greenhouse gases half of concrete s co2 emissions are created during the manufacture of clinker the most energy intensive part of the cement making process but other environmental impacts are far less well understood concrete is a thirsty behemoth sucking up almost a 10th of the world s industrial water use this often strains supplies for drinking and irrigation because 75 of this consumption is in drought and water stressed regions in cities concrete also adds to the heat island effect by absorbing the warmth of the sun and trapping gases from car exhausts and air conditioner units though it is at least better than darker asphalt it also worsens the problem of silicosis and other respiratory diseases the dust from wind blown stocks and mixers contributes as much as 10 of the coarse particulate matter that chokes delhi where researchers found in 2015 that the air pollution index at all of the 19 biggest construction sites exceeded safe levels by at least three times limestone quarries and cement factories are also often pollution sources along with the trucks that ferry materials between them and building sites at this scale even the acquisition of sand can be catastrophic destroying so many of the world s beaches and river courses that this form of mining is now increasingly run by organised crime gangs and associated with murderous violence concrete can take our civilisation upwards up to 163 storeys high in the case of the burj khalifa skyscraper in dubai creating living space out of the air but it also pushes the human footprint outwards sprawling across fertile topsoil and choking habitats the biodiversity crisis which many scientists believe to be as much of a threat as climate chaos is driven primarily by the conversion of wilderness to agriculture industrial estates and residential blocks for hundreds of years humanity has been willing to accept this environmental downside in return for the undoubted benefits of concrete but the balance may now be tilting in the other direction the pantheon and colosseum in rome are testament to the durability of concrete which is a composite of sand aggregate usually gravel or stones and water mixed with a lime based kiln baked binder the modern industrialised form of the binder portland cement was patented as a form of artificial stone in 1824 by joseph aspdin in leeds this was later combined with steel rods or mesh to create reinforced concrete the basis for art deco skyscrapers such as the empire state building rivers of it were poured after the second world war when concrete offered an inexpensive and simple way to rebuild cities devastated by bombing this was the period of brutalist architects such as le corbusier followed by the futuristic free flowing curves of oscar niemeyer and the elegant lines of tadao ando not to mention an ever growing legion of dams bridges ports city halls university campuses shopping centres and uniformly grim car parks in 1950 cement production was equal to that of steel in the years since it has increased 25 fold more than three times as fast as its metallic construction partner debate about the aesthetics has tended to polarise between traditionalists like prince charles who condemned owen luder s brutalist tricorn centre as a mildewed lump of elephant droppings and modernists who saw concrete as a means of making style size and strength affordable for the masses the politics of concrete are less divisive but more corrosive the main problem here is inertia once this material binds politicians bureaucrats and construction companies the resulting nexus is almost impossible to budge party leaders need the donations and kickbacks from building firms to get elected state planners need more projects to maintain economic growth and construction bosses need more contracts to keep money rolling in staff employed and political influence high hence the self perpetuating political enthusiasm for environmentally and socially dubious infrastructure projects and cement fests like the olympics the world cup and international exhibitions the classic example is japan which embraced concrete in the second half of the 20th century with such enthusiasm that the country s governance structure was often described as the doken kokka construction state facebook twitter pinterest a pressure controlled water tank in kusakabe japan constructed to protect tokyo against floodwaters and overflow of the city s major waterways and rivers during heavy rain and typhoon seasons photograph ho new reuters at first it was a cheap material to rebuild cities ravaged by fire bombs and nuclear warheads in the second world war then it provided the foundations for a new model of super rapid economic development new railway tracks for shinkansen bullet trains new bridges and tunnels for elevated expressways new runways for airports new stadiums for the 1964 olympics and the osaka expo and new city halls schools and sports facilities this kept the economy racing along at near double digit growth rates until the late 1980s ensuring employment remained high and giving the ruling liberal democratic party a stranglehold on power the political heavyweights of the era men such as kakuei tanaka yasuhiro nakasone and noboru takeshita were judged by their ability to bring hefty projects to their hometowns huge kickbacks were the norm yakuza gangsters who served as go betweens and enforcers also got their cut bid rigging and near monopolies by the big six building firms shimizu taisei kajima takenaka obayashi kumagai ensured contracts were lucrative enough to provide hefty kickbacks to the politicians the doken kokka was a racket on a national scale but there is only so much concrete you can usefully lay without ruining the environment the ever diminishing returns were made apparent in the 1990s when even the most creative politicians struggled to justify the government s stimulus spending packages this was a period of extraordinarily expensive bridges to sparsely inhabited regions multi lane roads between tiny rural communities cementing over the few remaining natural riverbanks and pouring ever greater volumes of concrete into the sea walls that were supposed to protect 40 of the japanese coastline in his book dogs and demons the author and longtime japanese resident alex kerr laments the cementing over of riverbanks and hillsides in the name of flood and mudslide prevention runaway government subsidised construction projects he told an interviewer have wreaked untold damage on mountains rivers streams lakes wetlands everywhere and it goes on at a heightened pace that is the reality of modern japan and the numbers are staggering he said the amount of concrete laid per square metre in japan is 30 times the amount in america and that the volume is almost exactly the same so we re talking about a country the size of california laying the same amount of concrete multiply america s strip malls and urban sprawl by 30 to get a sense of what s going on in japan traditionalists and environmentalists were horrified and ignored the cementation of japan ran contrary to classic aesthetic ideals of harmony with nature and an appreciation of mujo impermanence but was understandable given the ever present fear of earthquakes and tsunamis in one of the world s most seismically active nations everyone knew the grey banked rivers and which made the devastating 2011 tohoku earthquake and tsunami all the more shocking at coastal towns such as ishinomaki kamaishi and kitakami huge sea walls that had been built over decades were swamped in minutes almost 16 000 people died a million buildings were destroyed or damaged town streets were blocked with beached ships and port waters were filled with floating cars it was a still more alarming story at fukushima where the ocean surge engulfed the outer defences of the fukushima daiichi nuclear plant and caused a level 7 meltdown briefly it seemed this might become a king canute moment for japan when the folly of human hubris was exposed by the power of nature but the concrete lobby was just too strong the liberal democratic party returned to power a year later with a promise to spend 200tn yen 1 4tn on public works over the next decade equivalent to about 40 of japan s economic output facebook twitter pinterest it feels like we re in jail even though we haven t done anything bad a seawall in yamada iwate prefecture japan 2018 photograph kim kyung hoon reuters construction firms were once again ordered to hold back the sea this time with even taller thicker barriers their value is contested engineers claim these 12 metre high walls of concrete will stop or at least slow future tsunamis but locals have heard such promises before the area these defences protect is also of lower human worth now the land has been largely depopulated and filled with paddy fields and fish farms environmentalists say mangrove forests could provide a far cheaper buffer tellingly even many tsunami scarred locals hate the concrete between them and the ocean it feels like we re in jail even though we haven t done anything bad an oyster fisherman atsushi fujita told reuters we can no longer see the sea said the tokyo born photographer tadashi ono who took some of the most powerful images of these massive new structures he described them as an abandonment of japanese history and culture our richness as a civilisation is because of our contact with the ocean he said japan has always lived with the sea and we were protected by the sea and now the japanese government has decided to shut out the sea there was an inevitability about this across the world concrete has become synonymous with development in theory the laudable goal of human progress is measured by a series of economic and social indicators such as life expectancy infant mortality and education levels but to political leaders by far the most important metric is gross domestic product a measure of economic activity that more often than not is treated as a calculation of economic size gdp is how governments assess their weight in the world and nothing bulks up a country like concrete that is true of all countries at some stage during their early stages of development heavyweight construction projects are beneficial like a boxer putting on muscle but for already mature economies it is harmful like an aged athlete pumping ever stronger steroids to ever less effect during the 1997 98 asian financial crisis keynesian economic advisers told the japanese government the best way to stimulate gdp growth was to dig a hole in the ground and fill it preferably with cement the bigger the hole the better this meant profits and jobs of course it is much easier to mobilise a nation to do something that improves people s lives but either way concrete is likely to be part of the arrangement this was the thinking behind roosevelt s new deal in the 1930s which is celebrated in the us as a recession busting national project but might also be described as the biggest ever concrete pouring exercise up until that point the hoover dam alone required 3 3m cubic metres then a world record construction firms claimed it would outlast human civilisation but that was lightweight compared to what is now happening in china the concrete superpower of the 21st century and the greatest illustration of how the material transforms a culture a civilisation intertwined with nature into an economy a production unit obsessed by gdp statistics beijing s extraordinarily rapid rise from developing nation to superpower in waiting has required mountains of cement beaches of sand and lakes of water the speed at which these materials are being mixed is perhaps the most astonishing statistic of the modern age since 2003 china has poured more cement every three years than the us managed in the entire 20th century today china uses almost half the world s concrete the property sector roads bridges railways urban development and other cement and steel projects accounted for a third of its economy s expansion in 2017 every major city has a floor sized scale model of urban development plans that has to be constantly updated as small white plastic models are turned into mega malls housing complexes and concrete towers but like the us japan south korea and every other country that developed before it china is reaching the point where simply pouring concrete does more harm than good ghost malls half empty towns and white elephant stadiums are a growing sign of wasteful spending take the huge new airport in luliang which opened with barely five flights a day or the olympic bird s nest stadium so underused that it is now more a monument than a venue although the adage build and the people will come has often proved correct in the past the chinese government is worried after the national bureau of statistics found 450 sq km of unsold residential floor space the country s president xi jinping called for the annihilation of excess developments facebook twitter pinterest the three gorges dam on the yangtze river china is the largest concrete structure in the world photograph laoma alamy empty crumbling structures are not just an eyesore but a drain on the economy and a waste of productive land ever greater construction requires ever more cement and steel factories discharging ever more pollution and carbon dioxide as the chinese landscape architect yu kongjian has pointed out it also suffocates the ecosystems fertile soil self cleansing streams storm resisting mangrove swamps flood preventing forests on which human beings ultimately depend it is a threat to what he calls eco security yu has led the charge against concrete ripping it up whenever possible to restore riverbanks and natural vegetation in his influential book the art of survival he warns that china has moved dangerously far from taoist ideals of harmony with nature the urbanisation process we follow today is a path to death he has said yu has been consulted by government officials who are increasingly aware of the brittleness of the current chinese model of growth but their scope for movement is limited the initial momentum of a concrete economy is always followed by inertia in concrete politics the president has promised a shift of economic focus away from belching heavy industries and towards high tech production in order to create a beautiful country and an ecological civilisation and the government is now trying to wind down from the biggest construction boom in human history but xi cannot let the construction sector simply fade away because it employs more than 55 million workers almost the entire population of the uk instead china is doing what countless other nations have done exporting its environmental stress and excess capacity overseas beijing s much vaunted belt and road initiative an overseas infrastructure investment project many times greater than the marshall plan promises a splurge of roads in kazakhstan at least 15 dams in africa railways in brazil and ports in pakistan greece and sri lanka to supply these and other projects china national building material the country s biggest cement producer has announced plans to construct 100 cement factories across 50 nations this will almost certainly mean more criminal activity as well as being the primary vehicle for super charged national building the construction industry is also the widest channel for bribes in many countries the correlation is so strong people see it as an index the more concrete the more corruption according to the watchdog group transparency international construction is the world s dirtiest business far more prone to graft than mining real estate energy or the arms market no country is immune but in recent years brazil has revealed most clearly the jawdropping scale of bribery in the industry as elsewhere the craze for concrete in south america s biggest nation started benignly enough as a means of social development then morphed into an economic necessity and finally metastasised into a tool for political expediency and individual greed the progress between these stages was impressively rapid the first huge national project in the late 1950s was the construction of a new capital bras√≠lia on an almost uninhabited plateau in the interior a million cubic metres of concrete were poured on the highlands site in just 41 months to encase the soil and erect new edifices for ministries and homes facebook twitter pinterest the national museum of the republic by oscar niemeyer bras√≠lia brazil photograph image broker rex features this was followed by a new highway through the amazon rainforest the transamazonia and then from 1970 south america s biggest hydroelectric power plant the itaipu on the paran√° river border with paraguay which is almost four times bulkier than the hoover dam the brazilian operators boast the 12 3m cubic metres of concrete would be enough to fill 210 maracan√£ stadiums this was a world record until china s three gorges dam choked the yangtze with 27 2m cubic metres with the military in power the press censored and no independent judiciary there was no way of knowing how much of the budget was siphoned off by the generals and contractors but the problem of corruption has become all too apparent since 1985 in the post dictatorship era with virtually no party or politician left untainted for many years the most notorious of them was paulo maluf the governor of s√£o paulo who had run the city during the construction of the giant elevated expressway known as minhoc√£o which means big worm as well as taking credit for this project which opened in 1969 he also allegedly skimmed 1bn from public works in just four years part of which has been traced to secret accounts in the british virgin islands although wanted by interpol maluf evaded justice for decades and was elected to a number of senior public offices this was thanks to a high degree of public cynicism encapsulated by the phrase most commonly used about him he steals but he gets things done which could describe much of the global concrete industry facebook twitter pinterest paulo maluf attending the debate over the impeachment of president dilma rousseff in bras√≠lia 2016 photograph ueslei marcelino reuters but his reputation as the most corrupt man in brazil has been overshadowed in the past five years by operation car wash an investigation into a vast network of bid rigging and money laundering giant construction firms notably odebrecht andrade gutierrez and camargo corr√™a were at the heart of this sprawling scheme which saw politicians bureaucrats and middle men receive at least 2bn worth of kickbacks in return for hugely inflated contracts for oil refineries the belo monte dam the 2014 world cup the 2016 olympics and dozens of other infrastructure projects throughout the region prosecutors said odebrecht alone had paid bribes to 415 politicians and 26 political parties as a result of these revelations one government fell a former president of brazil and the vice president of ecuador are in prison the president of peru was forced to resign and dozens of other politicians and executives were put behind bars the corruption scandal also reached europe and africa the us department of justice called it the largest foreign bribery case in history it was so huge that when maluf was finally arrested in 2017 nobody batted an eyelid such corruption is not just a theft of tax revenue it is a motivation for environmental crime billions of tonnes of co2 pumped into the atmosphere for projects of dubious social value and often pushed through as in the case of belo monte against the opposition of affected local residents and with deep concerns among environmental licensing authorities although the dangers are increasingly apparent this pattern continues to repeat itself india and indonesia are just entering their high concrete phase of development over the next 40 years the newly built floor area in the world is expected to double some of that will bring health benefits the environmental scientist vaclav smil estimates the replacement of mud floors with concrete in the world s poorest homes could cut parasitic diseases by nearly 80 but each wheelbarrow of concrete also tips the world closer to ecological collapse chatham house predicts urbanisation population growth and economic development will push global cement production from 4 to 5bn tonnes a year if developing countries expand their infrastructure to current average global levels the construction sector will emit 470 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050 according to the global commission on the economy and climate this violates the paris agreement on climate change under which every government in the world agreed that annual carbon emissions from the cement industry should fall by at least 16 by 2030 if the world is to reach the target of staying within 1 5c to 2c of warming it also puts a crushing weight on the ecosystems that are essential for human wellbeing the dangers are recognised a report last year by chatham house calls for a rethink in the way cement is produced to reduce emissions it urges greater use of renewables in production improved energy efficiency more substitutes for clinker and most important the widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage technology though this is expensive and has not yet been deployed in the industry on a commercial scale architects believe the answer is to make buildings leaner and when possible to use other materials such as cross laminated timber it is time to move out of the concrete age and stop thinking primarily about how a building looks said anthony thistleton concrete is beautiful and versatile but unfortunately it ticks all the boxes in terms of environmental degradation he told the architects journal we have a responsibility to think about all the materials we are using and their wider impact but many engineers argue that there is no viable alternative steel asphalt and plasterboard are more energy intensive than concrete the world s forests are already being depleted at an alarming rate even without a surge in extra demand for timber phil purnell a professor of materials and structures at leeds university said the world was unlikely to reach a peak concrete moment the raw materials are virtually limitless and it will be in demand for as long as we build roads bridges and anything else that needs a foundation he said by almost any measure it s the least energy hungry of all materials instead he calls for existing structures to be better maintained and conserved and when that is not possible to enhance recycling currently most concrete goes to landfill sites or is crushed and reused as aggregate this could be done more efficiently purnell said if slabs were embedded with identification tags that would allow the material to be matched with demand his colleagues at leeds university are also exploring alternatives to portland cement different mixes can reduce the carbon footprint of a binder by up to two thirds they say arguably more important still is a change of mindset away from a developmental model that replaces living landscapes with built environments and nature based cultures with data driven economies that requires tackling power structures that have been built on concrete and recognising that fertility is a more reliable base for growth than solidity source concrete the most

lies that capitalists tell us william hawes follow 10 min read mar 23 2019 8 share co written with jason holland of reasonbowl com while idiotic supporters of our two party system wring their hands over the sensationalist nonsense reported by the mainstream media we thought it might be worth touching on the most dangerous lie of all time capitalism it s an all encompassing delusion including the myth of continual technological progress the mendacious assumptions of endless economic growth the lie that constant bombardments of media and consumer goods make us happy and the omissions of our involvement in the exploitation of the planet and the resources of distant poorer nations among other things we ve taken the time to hash out some of the most pernicious mendacities we ve come across in our relatively young lives in the workplace in our private lives and in the media please share these counter arguments far and wide in order to educate your fellow citizens and if necessary to provide the intellectual beat downs needed when arguing with pro capitalists so without further ado here is our list of the most devious lies that capitalists tell us 1 wealth will trickle down it s hard to believe an economic policy that conjures images of urination could be wrong but the idea is as bankrupt as the lower classes who have been subjected to the trickling less than ten people now have the financial wealth equivalent to half the planet and the trickling seems a lot more like a mad cash grab by the morally bankrupt elites rather than trickle down the 1 and their lackeys have hoovered up the majority of new wealth created since the 2008 crash after 40 years of stagnant wages in the us the people feel more shit on than trickled upon it s not a mistake that the elite reap most of the profits the capitalist system is designed this way it always has been and will be until we the people find the courage to tear it down and replace it with something better 2 i took all the risks it can be argued the average employee takes far more risks in any job than the average person who starts a business with employees the reason being is that the person starting a business usually has far more wealth where most americans can t afford a 500 dollar emergency

by haile gebriel endeshaw there are some books that need to be read repeatedly francis bacon said this in his own way there are some books to be tasted others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested yes there are some books that should be read with diligence and attention confession of an economic hit man is one of the books that won great acclaim by many readers those of us who are interested to know about the economic sabotage being done on developing countries in the name of aid will have to take time to read this wonderful book john perkins who served as an economic hit man ehm authored the book perkins said that it was very difficult for him to publish this book first he could not get daring publishers a man at a publishing house owned by a powerful international corporation read the draft and said a riveting story that needs to be told but fearing for bad reactions from his big bosses he advised perkins to fictionalize it but perkins did not accept the advice at last a courageous publisher which is not owned by an international corporation agreed to publish the book according to a reader perkins reveals shocking details of how united states government and corporate america work hand in hand in maintaining a dominating role in international affairs by using greed and corruption to inhibit foreign governments from economic development who are economic hit men ehms perkins tells us that ehms are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars they funnel money from world bank the u s agency for international development usaid and other foreign aid organizations into the coffers of huge corporations and the pockets of a few wealthy families who control the planet s natural resources if a certain country is believed to possess a natural resource like mineral oil cobalt diamond or uranium u s will take a closer look at that country let s say that the given mineral rich country desires to expand its infrastructure if the government of that country needs support or aid for the executions of these projects of infrastructure u s will take no time before it sends off its economic experts that do researches these experts are called economic hit men ehms the major tasks of the ehms are to collect pieces of information to be submitted to world bank wb or any other loan providing international organizations the information should be convincing so that these organizations can approve the loans perkins was told by his immediate boss about his responsibilities you are paid to cheat countries around the globe out of billions of dollars a large part of your job is to encourage world leaders to become part of a vast network that promotes u s commercial interests in the end those leaders become ensnared in a web of debt that ensures their loyalty we can draw on them whenever we desire to satisfy our political economic or military needs in return these leaders bolster their political positions by bringing industrial parks power plants and airports to their people meanwhile the owners of u s engineering and construction companies become very wealthy perkins recounts in his book the following like our counterparts in the mafia ehms provide favors these take the form of loans to develop infrastructure electric generating plants high ways ports air ports or industrial parks the loan given by wb never leaves the united states it is simply transferred from banking offices in washington to engineering offices in new york houston or san francisco the thing is that the poor country is purposely made to take a large amount of money which cannot be paid back by its own economic capacity this is said to burden the country with debts it can never pay when leaders of that country realize that they cannot pay back the loan they will be forced to do whatever they are asked by america when this happens then like the mafia we demand our pound of flesh this often includes one or more of the following control over united nations votes the installations of military bases or access to precious resources such as oil in this way the global empire demands its pounds of flesh in the form of oil concessions this is the reality we poor nations across the world have been confronted with if ehms are not successful in convincing or on the other way around compelling the leaders of that poor country to concede to the condition the next step will be taken the jackals will emerge to do their assignments these jackals are expected to do whatever is needed to overthrow or assassinate the leader of that country if the assassination is aborted a coup d √©tat will be orchestrated at long last if the jackals failed to do their assignments young americans will infiltrate under the cover of peacekeepers to sweep the dictators off their seats let s see this in the following way what happened in ecuador and panama is a good example america approached ecuador and panama by proposing loans for projects of infrastructure the real objective was that the global empire needed canal ownership and oil exploitation from these countries the two leaders of those countries however adamantly refused the extortion of their resources by the world super power yes president jaime roldos of ecuador and omar torrijos of panama did not bow down for the demand of america this means perkins who was assigned as ehm in these countries failed to convince them both now the lane seemed to have been left wide open for the jackals who were lurking around the jackals marched along with words of refusal of the two leaders echoing in their ears roldos warned all foreign interests including but not limited to oil companies that unless they implemented plans that would help ecuador s people they would be forced to leave his country he delivered a major speech at the atahualpa olympic stadium in quito and then headed off to a small community in southern ecuador he died there in a fiery airplane crash on may 24 1981 this was a lesson given to the other strong leader of panama general omar torrijos who insistently demanded america to relinquish the panama canal to its rightful owners omar torrijos confessed to having nightmares about his own assassination he saw himself dropping from the sky in a gigantic fireball it was prophetic two months after roldos s death omar torrijos s nightmare came true he died in a plane crash there was a bomb in the small plane in which he was flying it was july 31 1981 the surprising thing is that or every 100 of crude oil taken from ecuadorian rain forest the oil companies receive 75 of the remaining 25 three quarter must go to paying off the foreign dept most of the reminder covers military and other government expenses which leaves about 2 50 for health education and programs aimed at helping the poor thus out of every 100 worth oil torn from the amazon less than 3 goes to the people who need the money most those whose lives have been so adversely impacted by the dams the drilling and the pipelines and who are dying from lack of edible food and potable water after torrijos assassination his successor manuel noriega had strong attachment with u s but when he failed to renew license of the famous school of the americas of warfare training located in the canal zone of panama noriega was arrested following the bombardment of his country by the american army poor noriega was flown to miami and sentenced to 40 years of imprisonment the entire world was stunned by this breach of international law to invade an independent country mow down its defenseless people at the hands of the most powerful military force on the planet expressing the atrocious acts perkins says the u s army had prohibited the press the red cross and other outside observers from entering the heavily bombarded areas for three days while soldiers incinerated and buried the causalities the u s attack against panama was reported to be the largest air borne assault on a city since world war ii we can read in this book how oil embargo crippled the american economy in the early 1970s and how u s took measures to kneel down saudi arabia the major actor in this embargo how iraq was considered important to usa why it was invaded how venezuela was saved by sadam how usa orchestrated coup against the democratically elected premier of iran magnificent book to be read the writer can be reached at gizaw haile yahoo com
investors need to pay close attention to coty coty stock based on the movements in the options market lately for immediate release chicago il march 25 2019 zacks equity research unilever ul as the bull of the day adt inc adt asthe bear of the day in addition zacks equity research provides analysis on levi strauss co levi and stitch fix sfix here is a synopsis of all four stocks bull of the day it s feeling a little uncertain in the markets again these days president trump and fed chairman powell seem to be on the same page and in the most recent meeting the fed chose to leave short term rates unchanged and also hinted that they had almost no appetite for any raises in the near future powell pointed to the lingering effects of the trade war slowing growth in europe and china and an end to the natural stimulus of the 2017 tax cuts the central bank also lowered 2019 gdp growth estimates from 2 3 to 2 1 that s pretty significantly at odds with the 3 2 expected from the white house while the equity markets initially cheered to fed s actions reality quickly sank in and industrials materials and financials all took a hit as investors prepared themselves for a slowdown in the economy so maybe you re thinking about getting defensive that doesn t mean you turn all your holdings into cash and bury it in the backyard it means taking the time to find the companies that provide the best shareholder value possible even while weathering changing conditions how about a company who s brands are used by 2 5 billion people every day nutritious foods soaps and lotions dental care cleaning supplies literally everything we all use all the time it s unilever thanks to decades of aggressive acquisition unilever has become totally ubiquitous on the supermarket shelves after all this is the company that acquired both the slim fast and ben and jerry s brands at the same time that s diversification they ve since reduced their stake in slim fast to a small minority interest the company estimates that 70 of households in the world currently has at least one unilever product in their home with that type of market share unilever could easily rest on their laurels but instead takes the opposite approach constantly innovating to improve their internal processes attract and retain the best employees and provide the most attractive selection of products to their customers those customers remain loyal in no small part because of unilever s sustainable living plan which the company describes as the recognition that growth at the expense of people or the environment is both unacceptable and commercially unsustainable their stated commitment is to help more than a billion people to improve their health and well being halve the environmental footprint of our products source 100 of our agricultural raw materials sustainably and enhance the livelihoods of people across our value chain source unilever com there s more feel good stuff that we could talk about but let s make sure we also feel good about the financials even during a year in 2018 that challenged many global corporations with currency fluctuations commodity price uncertainty and general consumer discomfort while we fretted about trade wars brexit and other geopolitical uncertainty unilever grew sales by 3 1 improved operation margin 90bps to 18 4 and turned in healthy free cash flow of 5 billion though price and volume growth was fairly evenly distributed across the company the company reported that they saw the brands with the most distinct and well articulated social and environmental purpose grow significantly faster than out other brands we re expecting earnings growth of 2 87 in the current year and 3 16 next year and the zacks rank 1 strong buy stock also pays a 3 annual dividend yield even in a defensive sector unilever stands out just take a look at how it performed compared to the consumer staples sector and the s p 500 at the end of 2018 when things looked the darkest in uncertain conditions it s literally the best of the best bear of the day home security is one of those things that we know is necessary but don t really like to think about you know that in an uncertain and sometimes dangerous world you need to protect your family home and belongings until fairly recently that meant hiring a security company to install equipment in your home and then also paying them to monitor the signals from that equipment and alert you and or the appropriate authorities when there was a problem it was a great business they got to sell you the original equipment and then also collect fees for the monitoring services on a continuing basis though there were plenty of local firms that could do that there was one undisputed national leader in the business adt inc the internet of things has changed that starting with what were essentially just smart doorbells that allowed customers to see who was coming to the door home security options have now expanded into a vast universe of interconnected products that provide security services but also allow you to control locks lights garage doors climate control systems and even items like pet food dispensers and all from a smartphone there are choices for every level of customer from basic diy components that you can purchase and install yourself to professional quality total automation systems most of them are also modular meaning you can start with a basic setup and then add components as needed that are basically plug and play if you want professional monitoring that will still cost money of course but in most cases it s much less expensive than adt simplisafe charges 14 99 month nest is 29 month but that drops to 19 if you commit to a three year contract and ring s protect plus is only 10 month adt pulse starts at 28 99 month with a three year contract and can easily grow to 60 with added features note the above prices are from a february 2019 survey by pcmag com and may have changed so where does all this leave adt in a pretty ugly place zacks rank 5 strong sell territory home security and automation is becoming a crowded industry and that s great news for homeowners who

of last week opening at 22 22 trading as high as 23 24 and as low as 22 00 levi strauss is an american clothing brand that has been a household name for as long as jeans have existed in fact levi strauss actually created the first pair of jeans in 1873 this company started in 1853 in san francisco jeans gained its fame in the dude ranch era in the early 1900s and were quickly adopted by younger edgier generations until they became the societal norm we see today with levi leading the charge in this culture shift now levi s can be found in 50 000 retail stores across 110 countries now after 166 years of operation they decide to open up ownership of the company to the public again they went public initially in 1971 to give the heirs of this empire a chance to cash out raising about 50 million the family decided to take it private in 1985 through a 1 7 billion leveraged buyout making it the largest buyout ever at the time this 2019 ipo raising 623 3 million and valuing the company at 6 55 billion couldn t have come at a more opportune time for levi considering that their operational performance appears to be at an all time high levi has had consistent top line growth over the past 4 years as well as a 167 bottom line growth over the past 5 years what some retail investors don t know is that an ipo is most beneficial when a company is valued at its highest because the company only receives capital on the day of the ipo an enterprise doesn t collect on a soaring stock price only the shareholders do with market valuations high this appeared to be an ideal time for levi to recapitalize as a potential shareholder we need to ask ourselves if this is the peak or does levi strauss still have room for growth this surge of 623 3 million into their balance sheet should help innovative ceo charles v bergh further diversify levi s portfolio and reduce inefficiencies in its supply chain this company has already been working to grow beyond its leading category of men s bottoms and will further invest in tops and women s apparel levi plans to dig its nails deeper into its emerging markets business specifically china and india where they plan to open new stores and build rapport with their consumers just like every other retail business they will focus on building out their e commerce sites levi is also going to reduce time to market for new products to stay in front of trends one risk associated with any retail apparel business is the amount of consumer discretionary spending that the economy has to spend with unemployment close to the lowest it s been in 50 years and steady wage growth businesses that rely on consumer discretionary spending don t have anything to worry about yet one thing that we can all agree on is that jeans aren t going out of style anytime soon stitch fix is another retail apparel company that just went public in november of 2017 stitch fix is an online business that helps consumers pick their wardrobe that fits their style and who they are sfix is up 85 since its ipo and looks to have room to grow based on its zacks rank 2 buy as you can see below estimates for three consecutive quarters following the current

given the media barrage surrounding venezuela s humanitarian crisis recent tensions on the venezuela colombia border and talks of military options and coup attempts it was hard to know what to expect on returning to the country for the first time in five years i envisaged a country on a knife s edge particularly as i arrived in caracas on march 5 this was the day after opposition leader and self proclaimed interim president juan guaid√≥ re entered the country and the anniversary of the death of hugo ch√°vez predecessor to elected president nicol√°smaduro yet the capital was remarkably quiet it was carnaval one of the most important holiday periods for venezuelans and like every other year most venezuelans preferred to spend it at the beach or visiting family over the next two weeks the relative calm and stability in a country with on paper at least two competing presidents and which faced an unprecedented days long nationwide electricity blackout affecting access to water and telecommunications was striking extreme contradictions equally striking were the extreme contradictions that have emerged due on the one hand to the gains of the revolutionary process venezuela has undergone during the past two decades and on the other hand the recent and rapid rollback of many of these due to the deep economic crisis during the boom years of the ch√°vez government wealth redistribution meant that the poorest sectors could access basic products trademark brands and domestic electronic goods that had always been out of reach this began to change following ch√°vez s death the escalation of the economic war against the maduro government meant certain goods became scarce today it is again easy to find most of these goods and relatively cheaply when taken in us terms as the economist recently noted ranking caracas the cheapest city in the world but hyperinflation has meant workers wages have plummeted making most things far from cheap for the majority who are paid in bolivars the local currency venezuela s current minimum wage the lowest in the region stands at less than us 6 a month or enough to buy one egg per day even a skilled worker there are many due to the huge expansion in access to university education under ch√°vez and maduro might earn as little as 10 20 per month technology firms that have set up operation in venezuela despite the recent economic crisis have taken advantage of this combination of a highly skilled low waged workforce seeking out the cheapest goods in a context of spiralling prices is a daily challenge made more complex by the impact of political events after the venezuelan colombian border was closed in late february prices dropped on a number of goods previously being taken across the border for resale at higher prices prices spiralled up again during the blackout as food stocks went bad due to lack of refrigeration purchasing goods and services with bolivars is increasingly hard interstate bus trips which generally have to be paid in cash require handing over a brick of notes there is a lack of access of bills and banks are limiting daily withdrawals to less than us 1 it is common to find street hawkers with debit and credit card machines and many happy to accept us dollars to overcome this problem in border states such as apure and even barinas several hours from the border vendors accept and sometimes prefer colombian pesos as the value of bolivars depreciates daily gains of the revolution for venezuelans in particular the poorer sections this has led to a dramatic cultural shift in consumption in place of the trademark brands and traditional staple foods many were accustomed to a few years ago most venezuelans are forced to make do with what they can access dealing with the current crisis requires finding other means to make ends meet many venezuelans have been helped by the ongoing achievements of the revolution the provision of millions of homes for the poor means despite the crisis homelessness in caracas is much less visible than in other south american capitals similarly the cost of basic services remains the lowest in the region when compared with the rest of the region venezuelans have the cheapest electricity the greatest percentage of household connectivity and the highest per capita consumption surpassing more industrialised countries such as brazil details largely overlooked by the media during the recent blackout venezuelans have been able to ameliorate the impacts of the crisis through the local committees for supply and production or clap by its spanish acronym these committees regularly distribute boxes to local families containing food products imported by the government the government has also regularly deposited bonus payments into people s accounts to provide much needed funds there are many examples of how communities independently of the government have sought to organise themselves to either produce locally or connect up with other communities in rural areas to get food to those who most need it another means of survival is the flourishing of everyday illegal economic activities such as reselling clap products and other goods on the black market or over the border in colombia the scale of contraband is so large that venezuelan petrol crossing the border not only meets all of eastern colombia s demand but is purchased and refined by colombia s state oil company for export others seek to overcome the effects of the economic crisis by sending family members abroad with the aim of them sending remittances back home others have decided to simply migrate taking qualifications and skills with them so who is to blame for the crisis the answer depends on who you ask for the opposition it is the fault of the corrupt narco castro chavista dictatorship headed by an illegitimate president for government supporters blame lies with us imperialism and its lackeys in the local right wing opposition which have used sanctions sabotage and economic warfare in their attempt to bring down maduro for others the concern is less with who is to blame and more with the complete lack of proposals and solutions coming from either side to overcome the crisis sanctions there can be no denying that sanctions and economic warfare have had dramatic consequences according to the latin american geopolitical strategic centre celag the direct and indirect damage of economic actions against venezuela cost the economy about us 350 billion from 2013 17 sanctions have only worsened since then the sanctions together with the recent coup push and threats of military intervention have provided the perfect cover for corrupt and bureaucratic sectors within the government to further their agenda in the name of emergency measures and the need to control the distribution of resources government officials have sought to bypass controls on how funds are spent and attempted to supplant community organising with initiatives controlled by local officials of the governing united socialist party of venezuela psuv this combination of internal destabilisation and foreign intervention has created a climate in which communities with legitimate demands feel hesitant to protest despite criticisms they have of the government they do not want to be used by the opposition in its coup drive security forces have also used this climate to justify repression against non political protests chavez s legacy these issues were raised by activists many of whom continue to identify with chavismo a political movement of the poor that contrary to misconceptions in the media and even on the left continues to include millions in its ranks and maintains the same self critical stance and diversity of views it always has it is perhaps here where ch√°vez s greatest legacy can be found traditionally marginalised venezuela s popular classes exploded onto the political scene in the late 1980s and developed into the political movement that takes the name of its most well known leader over the next few decades these sectors flooded into areas they had always been excluded from universities shopping malls state institutions the upper echelons of the military all the way to the presidency they penetrated deeply into the venezuelan military forging a profound civic military alliance which continues to be the base of support of the government they also acquired an ever growing consciousness of their role in history and world politics talk to a chavista and they will explain to you the role venezuela played in the liberation of south america from spanish colonialism they will also outline in great detail the vast reserves of national resources the country contains and how they are coveted by many not just the united states there is little doubt chavismo has been hit hard by the recent crisis has lost some of the support it had in its heyday under ch√°vez and contains a diversity of views towards the current government but it continues to exist and refuses to be pushed back into obscurity the refusal of maduro s opponents to acknowledge chavismo s existence goes a long way to explaining why despite venezuela s profound crisis maduro remains in the presidential palace originally published by green left weekly federico fuentes is a green left journalist

neutral and it s good time to pause and be cautious yet that s a rather abrupt turn as just back in january he expected fed could hike as many as three times this year assuming the economy remains reasonably strong evans described the inversion of 3 month to 10 year yield curve as pretty narrow but he also noted that there s be a secular decline in long term interest rates some of his is structural having to do with lower trend growth lower real interest rates hence in that environment it s probably more natural that yield curves are somewhat flatter than they have been historically

democrats are in a mood to spend again as you can tell if you ve been reading about their presidential candidates from the 1990s onward democrats were eager to persuade voters that they were fiscally conservative in contrast to tax cutting republicans more recently they seem to have concluded that voters don t care about fiscal restraint over the last two years republicans have cut taxes and both parties have agreed to raise spending democrats are not responding as they might have in the past with promises to cut the deficit instead they are advertising their willingness to spend trillions of dollars on single payer health plans and a green new deal intellectuals aligned with the democrats are caught up in the new mood a previous column tackled one of the justifications liberal intellectuals have been making for worrying less about deficits that low interest rates make this a good time for the federal government to borrow money and invest it among the defects of this argument it overlooks the possibility that interest rates are low because expected productivity growth is also low and that the returns on federal investment may therefore have declined to match the decline in interest rates now jared bernstein who speaking of the presidential race was chief economist for then vice president joe biden is advancing another argument for spending big in the washington post he writes that we should raise spending on infrastructure job creation health care expanded social security benefits and more it s not just that we can tolerate all this spending thanks to low interest rates we positively need it economic conditions right now make this an excellent time for a bolder the better agenda supporting this case he makes two main points the first is that the economy appears to be slowing and so needs either fiscal or monetary stimulus the second is that we appear to be facing structurally weak underlying demand bernstein s point about the near term trajectory of the economy is a weak justification for the program he wants look back at his list of spending priorities he s not talking about one off spending he s talking about a gigantic permanent increase in federal spending if the economy is about to slip into recession that could be a reason to embark on a counter cyclical burst of spending it s not a reason to ensure higher outlays forever his second point about chronically weak demand better matches prescription to diagnosis but both are open to challenge bernstein s evidence for his diagnosis is that the economy seems to require interest rates that are low by historical standards the fed is holding off on raising the federal funds rate above 2 5 percent in order to keep the economy growing if the neutral or natural interest rate has fallen though low demand may not be the culprit it s what one would expect in a mature economy with fewer opportunities for productivity growth in that case what would be needed are reforms to improve productivity additional spending by the federal government if targeted well could be among those reforms but spending more or redistributing more in order to boost demand would not be called for if the diagnosis of persistently weak demand is correct on the other hand then it is worth giving more consideration to an alternative prescription that bernstein mentions only in passing he notes that a more expansive monetary policy could address the problem monetary expansion seems preferable to fiscal expansion for several reasons when the federal reserve expands the money supply or takes other expansionary action it does not require that more taxpayer dollars go to interest payments on the federal debt or that future taxes be raised its policies can also be reversed more easily if it goes too far or conditions make it unnecessary however difficult it has been for the federal reserve to raise interest rates over the last decade congress has found tax increases or spending cuts even harder another draw at least for conservatives like me is that monetary expansion doesn t raise the government s share of the economy whereas additional federal spending does bernstein has presented a sophisticated case for much higher federal spending but voters should remain wary of all that new spending and unconvinced that the economy needs it ramesh ponnuru is a bloomberg view columnist he is a senior editor of national review and the author of the party of death the democrats the media the courts and the disregard for human life to read more of his reports click here now copyright 2018 bloomberg l p all rights reserved

calling the new law a sensible set of policies david dollar a senior fellow in the john l thornton china center at the brookings institution said it is definitely a step forward in the country s continued reform and opening up dollar said opening up more sectors would allow the entry of high quality imports and also increase competition so that chinese companies could improve which would ultimately benefit china s economic growth selcuk colakoglu director of turkish center for asia pacific studies said that the law enhances the protection of intellectual property rights ipr of foreign investors and makes international companies to invest more in china confidently delivering promises by holding the first ciie and opening up more sectors to foreign investment china has proved it will always honor what it has promised about 960 000 foreign invested enterprises had been set up in china with the accumulated fdi exceeding 2 1 trillion u s dollars by the end of 2018 according to china s ministry of commerce colakoglu also a professor of international relations said the new law will allow foreign investors enjoy treatment no less favorable than that afforded to chinese investors at the stage of investment access according to the world bank china ranked 46th globally for ease of doing business in 2018 up from 78 in 2017 within this framework colakoglu noted that the foreign investment law will be a landmark arrangement that will open china s door wider to the outside world the belt and road initiative bri proposed by xi in 2013 to boost economic growth by improving the trade and infrastructure network connecting asia with europe africa and beyond is another manifestation of china s resolve to further open up over the past year more friends have joined in the initiative with an additional 50 plus countries and international organizations signing the cooperation documents raising the total number of such documents to over 150 during xi s recent state visit to italy the european country signed with china a memorandum of understanding mou on bri cooperation becoming the first group of seven nation to join the initiative i believe the initiative has great potential in terms of economic development and international cooperation it is a very interesting concept and a framework for a new type of multilateralism spurred by china said carola ramon berjano a member of argentina s council on international relations for countries like argentina that lacks the needed infrastructure to boost trade the bri is an attractive and relevant proposal said ramon berjano stressing that it will help the country achieve inclusive and sustainable development in the long run global benefits as china gradually advances the opening up in various sectors in accordance with the timetable announced at the bfa last year the world s second largest economy with its gdp now exceeding 90 trillion yuan about 13 4 trillion u s dollars continues to contribute to global growth though china faced a complicated and challenging environment rarely seen in many years with the economy under new downward pressure the nation managed to accomplish main targets for

and great creativity to unleash li noted according to data from the un conference on trade and development foreign direct investment fdi inflow to china has ranked first among developing countries for 27 consecutive years china did a great job to attract fdi to the country since 1979 gradual opening of the chinese domestic market has provided a sustainable development within a stable environment colakoglu said china s last four decades of transformation has attracted global attention and china is greatly sought by most nations for building engagements said swaran singh a professor at the school of international studies of the delhi based jawaharlal nehru university india there is increasingly acceptability today in china taking the lead in several regional and global initiatives he noted duncan freeman a research fellow at the college of europe in bruges belgium said china s opening up and reforms have been extremely important for the global economy for the past 40 years and it is even more so today when china has a very big economy when commenting on the global economic trend the expert said there are a certain number of challenges including those faced by the international economic system and the global growth for this reason china s commitment to ongoing reforms openness and sustaining its domestic growth is extremely important as a contribution not just to the maintenance of an open global economic system but to global growth he said xinhua reporters yi aijun in istanbul xiong maoling in washington hu xiaoming in new delhi and federico grandesso in brussels
