china s northern dalian port has effectively banned imports of australian coal with 2019 annual capacity restricted to 12mt according to an official at dalian port group australian coal exports are the country s biggest earner generating 64bn income with dollar tumbling on the news to fall more than 1 to as low as a 0 7086 five harbours overseen by dalian customs dalian bayuquan panjin dandong and beiliang will not allow australian coal to clear through customs said the official coal imports from russia and indonesia will not be affected the indefinite ban on imports from top supplier australia effective since the beginning of feb arrives as major ports across china also prolong clearing times for the coal rose from 25 day to at least 40 days while beijing has been trying to restrict imports of coal more generally to support domestic prices the ban comes amid simmering tensions between beijing and canberra over issues such as cyber security and china s influence in pacific island nations australia recently revoked the visa of a prominent chinese businessman further straining ties billionaire huang xiangmo a property developer called australia a giant baby as he was refused permission to stay in the country partly due to concerns over his ties to the chinese government the ban is currently centred on coking coal used in steel making however fears are growing it will spread to other ports and to thermal coal used in power generation it is hard to find a replacement for australian coking coal since its sulphur content is very low said a purchasing manager at a large coke plant in hebei province said a purchasing manager at a large coke plant in hebei province current inventory at ports should be sufficient to support usage for one or two months but it could be a problem in the long term especially if other ports also tighten imports he added australian dollar falls as chinese dalian port bans australian coal imports in huawei related move the a is

positions amid increasing participation rate as well employment change 000 39 1 v 16 9 revised from 21 6 in december and 15 0 forecast china is playing dirty in banning australian coal imports through its giant dalian port coal terminal it will be interesting to see if the ban will be extended to other ports and if coal traders will be able to find sufficient shipments of non australian coal to replace this material we suspect the authorities are working off the assumption that china s power generators have sufficient coal stocks to manage without australian coal for a few weeks months it will be interesting to see if china had been stockpiling more coal than normal over the past few weeks much coal is blended in the world to improve its calorific value reduce ash content etc to meet minimum requirements and australian coal will likely find its way into dalian china via this blending process vanadium prices remain stable at us 76 78 kgv ferro vanadium prices remain stable at us 76

addition future output expectations turn negative for the first time since november 2012 which come as no surprise given the international headwinds japanese manufacturers are facing such as a china

contributing to better air quality said the eu in a statement with heavy duty vehicles producing around a quarter of co2 emissions from road transport in the eu and around 6 of the eu s total co2 emissions the eu expects the regulation to cut 54 million tonnes of co2 emissions between 2020 and 2030 germany services sector growth masks deepening weakening in manufacturing as strong fundamentals in the domestic market are driving growth in services business activity while falling exports continue to weigh on the performance of the manufacturing sector markit data showed overall business activity in germany climbed to a 4 month high led by gains in the services industry that was growing at the strongest pace in five months however the export oriented manufacturing sector slipped further into contraction as export orders dropped to the greatest extent for over six years in terms of the factors behind the slowdown in manufacturing order books many of the usual suspects the

the gilets jaunes protests manufacturers recorded stabilising production in february new orders book continued to contract for the third month in a row albeit only at a marginal rate overall the change was driven by a softer decline in the services sector and a first increase in order for four months at manufacturers on growth outlook markit writes the economy will continue to post below its potential as long as social unrest continues and amid the current uncertainty in the global economy domestic issues weighing on activity are likely to remain detrimental in line with germany data

reserve s policy stance with optimism over progress in the fight between washington and beijing and signals from the u s central bank that hint at the possibility of further hikes fed minutes released yesterday showed some policymakers did not rule out a pause to rate hikes if the economy does not perform as planned as well as considered changes to the pace of the current balance sheet reduction several participants argued further increases to rates might be necessary only if inflation growth exceeds their outlook while several others saw rate rises as appropriate later this year if the economy evolves as forecast minutes read commenting on the size of the balance sheet the fed thought it would be desirable to soon announce a plan to stop the wind down of the fed s balance sheet later this year capital economics suggested the fed might want to stop balance sheet run down sometime in h2 19 implying taking it to around 3 5tn from current 4 0tn official seem persuaded that they should halt the run down even before reserves fall to their desired long term level which is presumably a bit below the current 1 6tn reserves would then continue to fall gradually capital economics

breakthrough as irish researchers triple storage capacity researchers at trinity college dublin have found that incorporating a type of ultra thin nanomaterial into the structure of a battery s electrode could triple the storage capacity compared to a conventional battery and their hope is that the technology can be easily incorporated into battery manufacture prof valeria nicolosi professor of nanomaterials and advanced microscopy at the school of chemistry said in a rechargeable lithium ion battery you have electrodes where the charge is stored and in order to store more charge we need to make these electrodes thicker but these electrodes can only be manufactured to a certain thickness there is a threshold beyond which if we make the electrode too thick it starts cracking and the battery fails the researchers from trinity college and drexel university in philadelphia have explored how they might enable thicker battery electrodes they looked at a class of ultra thin nanomaterial called mxenes ultra thin sheets that are mechanically very strong and can conduct electricity effectively company news anglo american aal ln follow2017 5 pence mkt cap 26 05bn broad based

the coal operations as it benefitted from both an 11 increase in sales volumes and a 3 improvement in price while south african thermal coal us 695m up 18 and colombian thermal caol us 388m up 1 represent 22 and 12 respectively the company particularly alludes to the strong performance at moronbah which improved on its previous record and produced 6 8mt and grosvenor which increased output to 3 8mt as contributory factors in the performance of its metallurgical coal operations as contributory factors in the performance of its metallurgical coal operations copper s ebitda contribution of us

around 14 of ebitda us 1 25bn although the overall figure was around 13 lower than the us 1 44bn reported for 2017 and the company comments that margins in the trading business were lower owing to volatile market conditions anglo platinum s us 1 06bn contribution to ebitda represents a 23 increase on the 2017 result and approximately 12 of the total while the contribution from the iron ore operations declined by 36 to us 1 18bn reflecting the suspension of minas rio throughout much of the year following the two leaks in the 529 kilometre iron ore pipeline from the mine to the port of açu exploration activities increased across most product groups but predominantly in diamonds commenting on the group s performance in 2018 chief executive mark cutifani said our focus on efficiency and productivity including through our operating model implementation is continuing to deliver benefits in terms of both safety and financial returns in 2018 we produced 10 more product on a copper equivalent basis from half the number of assets we had in 2012 as a result our productivity 1 per employee has doubled supporting a 12 percentage point increase in mining margin 2 to 42 and placing us amongst the leaders in the industry conclusion anglo american s 12 increase in attributable profit and 4 improvement in underlying ebitda has led to further reductions in debt and is supported by improvements across most of its operating divisions and we expect the resumption of operations at minas rio to help the recovery of the iron ore business the group s coal operations particularly its

see glencore s statement on limiting its coal production it is particularly interesting given the ceo s history and huge success in coal trading quick inspection reveals glencore is running at full capacity with its coal mines and effectively have the biggest free put option on coal in the market we read the statement more from an m a perspective in that glencore feels full up from a coal perspective and will now focus its acquisitive eyes on the domination of other commodities problem for glencore today is that the giant dalian bulk commodity terminal in china has just banned coal imports from australia in a move that is almost certain retaliation for australia s banning of huawei technology the move is interesting as coal importers are going to have to move fast to replace australian cargos with coal from indonesia and india though many cargos may be rerouted through other chinese ports this disruption may also impact coal stocks at chinese coal fired power stations china is almost totally dependent on coal for power generation with new cleaner burning coal fired power stations being built to supply growing demand and to replace older more polluting power plants

project in brazil s para state where following publication of the feasibility study in december 2018 it is now advancing project financing options reiterating the principal conclusions of the feasibility work for the 28 year project comprising an initial production phase where approximately 900 000tpa of ore is treated in a rotary kiln electric furnace rkef to produce approximately 14 500tpa of nickel contained in 52 000tpa of ferronickel the study concluded that capital investment of us 443m for the initial phase of the project is expected too generate an after tax npv8 of us 401m and an irr of 20 1 with cash costs equivalent to us 3 08 lb of contained nickel and that doubling production for additional internally funded expenditure of us 199 7m enhances the after tax npv8 to us

with midterm consensus pricing of us 16 792 tonne t ni for 2022 compared with the us 14 000 t price assumed in the feasibility study compared with the us 14 000 t price assumed in the feasibility study the company also alludes to expectations the brazilian economy is set for growth in 2019 and 2020 with gdp set to increase 2 4 and 2 3 respectively and points to brazil having tightened control over inflation rates which have decreased from 8 8 in 2016 to 3 6 in 2018 taken a series of measures aimed to improve fiscal responsibility reduced government spending and increased direct foreign

proximity to araguaia although at this stage the company is not indicating a timetable for completion of this work it says that there are several phases of work currently underway at vermelho the first is to demonstrate upgrading the mixed hydroxide product mhp to nickel and cobalt sulphate suitable for use in the evolving ev battery market the second phase will utilise the high grade saprolite material to produce ferronickel via the same rkef flow sheet as developed at araguaia although at this stage the company is not indicating a timetable for completion of this work it says

striking at sibanye stillwater s gold mines for some time would also look to fight it s action on a second front we had a long meeting with sibanye stillwater management a few weeks ago to gain an understanding of the situation the existing amcu strike action at sibanye stillwater has been running for some months in south africa and losing its effectiveness with the amcu union losing members and management managing to run its mines relatively well despite the action sibanye see the amcu action as politically motivated with amcu union leaders refusing to accept any reasonable offer notice the long running and rival union the num which was formerly led by president cyril ramaphosa is not supporting the amcu and is not on strike ramaphosa was also formerly a director of lonmin and understands the union situation well sibanye stillwater s takeover of lonmin is conditional on the restructuring of much of the lonmin operation to ensure its longer term viability with the potential closure of some unprofitable shafts fortunately for all concerned the basket price for platinum group metals pgms has risen substantially this year driven by palladium which has risen 80 to 1 466 oz since last august while platinum has risen 9 this combined with sa rand dollar depreciation should offset much of the increase in escom power costs and labour cost inflation labour currently accounts for around 50 of total operating costs at sibanye stillwater sibanye stillwater interim results released today report a small fall in 4e pgm production through the second half to december the fall in production is more than offset by significantly higher pgm basket prices which came in at 1 039 oz vs 1 051 oz on h1 through the second half and will have risen significantly further this year all in

throughout this year before a further deterioration in economic growth forces it to cut rates by a total of 75 basis points in 2020 he said the fed signalled it will soon lay out a plan to stop letting go of 4 trillion in bonds and other assets though policymakers are still debating how long their newly adopted patient stance on u s rates will last yuan firms aussie tumbles in the currency

analyst ole hansen told reuters currencies and bonds the canadian dollar was steady ahead of thursday s remarks by mr poloz as the greenback advanced against a group of world currencies on renewed expectations that there could be an interest rate hike this year the day range on the loonie is 75 72 us cents to 75 97 us cents on wednesday the canadian dollar touched its best level in two weeks helped by rallying oil prices and renewed optimism over trade talks between the united states and china for the canadian dollar the day s key event remains mr poloz s midday speech and subsequent press conference he is expected to confirm the main message from the jan 9 policy statement that interest rates will need to rise over time into a neutral range bank of montreal economist sal guatieri said in a note still he should stress that the appropriate pace will depend on how the outlook evolves which hinges largely on oil prices the housing market and trade policies since the last policy statement mr guatieri said u s crude prices have risen about 8 per cent while canadian prices have held above 40 as well the canadian housing market has shown more signs of stability outside of vancouver and the oil producing regions however it s unlikely that the more positive developments have moved the dial on bank policy especially with the economy braking hard late last year he said more recently the governor said there is no preset course for rates and it s all about the data stressing patience he is unlikely to signal an imminent rate hike until there is more clarity on key concerns a surprise rise in december wholesale sales also helped underpin the loonie statistics canada said sales for the month rose 0 3 per cent exceeding market forecasts in world currencies

the chinese renminbi and indian rupee weathered last year s emerging market turbulence with greater aplomb that currencies of the other bric members the brazilian real and russian ruble figure 1 while india s currency enjoyed a relatively calm 2018 the general elections coming up in april hold out the possibility of a much more challenging year for the rupee figure 1 the rupee performed well during emerging market turbulence in 2018 in the months prior to the india s last election in april 2014 the rupee strengthened by 20 versus the u s dollar and by about 15 versus the euro in anticipation of the bharatiya janata party s bjp landslide victory indeed the 2014 election produced a humdinger of a result prime minister narendra modi s bjp party went from 116 seats to 282 seats in india s lower house of parliament 10 more than needed for a majority combined with allies bjp s majority totaled 64 seats in fact it was the first time that any party achieved an outright majority since 1984 what drove the currency market s pre election optimism was hopes for radical reforms to land laws taxes and labor markets that would allow india s economic growth to rival that of china during the 1990s and 2000s the currency market s celebration however lasted about one month after the polls since then the rupee has fallen by about 20 against the u s dollar it also fell by about 12 versus the renminbi but has outperformed commodity currencies such as the real and the ruble by about 30 and 40 respectively unlike brazil and russia china and india are not reliant on commodity exports so moves in raw material prices have less impact in fact lower oil prices were helpful to india reducing the need for fuel subsidies as it freed up money for other budget priorities modi s economic reforms have produced mixed results so far on the positive side modi opened numerous industries to foreign direct investment including infrastructure in 2017 he also managed to get the goods and services tax enacted which rolled a byzantine system of 17 separate taxes into one he has also made progress towards simplifying india s notoriously complicated administrative structure other reforms didn t turn out as hoped for his administration backed off some labor market reforms following protests unable to gain passage of land reform he attempted to impose it by executive fiat but later had to let his order lapse the true disaster however was a reform that he never campaigned on and implemented seemingly on a whim demonetization demonetization was an attempt to force the informal cash based economy into the banking system by getting rid of 500 and 1 000 rupee denominations essentially overnight this reform wasn t devastating for the economy though it did slow growth temporarily figure 2 demonetization s main cost was political it proved highly unpopular among the owners of small businesses who had formed part of the nucleus of his support and led to accusations that it increased inequality by favoring larger businesses and the wealthy figure 2 india s growth under modi has not been exceptional the bjp has slid in the polls figure 3 so far all but one survey shows the party still winning more seats in 2019 than any other individual party but since demonetization few polls suggest that bjp will win an outright majority as such if the election results turn out as expected india will be facing a hung parliament and the likelihood of a coalition government the silver lining for the rupee is that unlike in 2014 it is blessed with low expectations this time around figure 3 the 2019 outcome is not obvious that currency traders have low expectations for modi doesn t mean however that the election outcome doesn t contain significant risks for example if modi surprises the markets and wins an outright majority again the currency might rally based upon the idea that he will be able to accomplish reforms left undone during his first term in office american and british readers of this article will be reminded that reagan and thatcher scored some of their biggest successes in their second terms at the other extreme there is possibility of an outright congress party win which was suggested in one rather anomalous poll in january this would suggest that voters want to send modi s reforms in reverse and would likely cause a short term selloff in the currency between these two extreme possibilities there are several hues of a hung parliament if the bjp falls just short of a majority it will probably be able to cobble together a coalition that is amenable to his economic policies this might result in a relief rally for the currency by contrast if modi s party wins more seats than anyone else but falls far short of a majority the task of assembling a coalition and governing the country could become unwieldy and result in policy paralysis that could be negative in the short term that said policy paralysis isn t always a bad thing doing nothing is better than doing something counterproductive american investors are accustomed to long periods of policy paralysis and have done just fine 1995 2000 and 2011 16 outside of the election india s fundamentals look solid unlike china and brazil there has been no rise in overall debt figure 4 although government debt is a bit higher than it ideally should be if china runs into serious trouble during the 2020s india probably won t be affected for starters india doesn t export much to china and secondly if china slows dramatically it could be a disaster for commodity prices which is mostly beneficial for india as a big net importer of raw materials figure 4 unlike brazil and china india hasn t had a worrisome rise in debt levels one item of concern however is the independence of monetary policy on december 10 2018 the reserve bank of india s governor urjit patel took the unusual step of resigning before his three year term expired apparently because of disagreements with modi presumably these disagreements concerned the tightness of monetary policy heading into the election indeed patel s successor shaktikanta das cut rates in early february despite a modest rise in the rate of inflation figures 5 and 6 the currency market took this in stride even so investors can be unforgiving of currencies whose central banks appear not to be independent for their part investors seem to see das s move as a one off pre election anomaly with little in the way of long term consequences figure 5 a politically motivated pre election rate cut figure 6 with inflation on the rise why cut rates now bottom line india s election poses a significant event risk for the rupee an outright modi win could send the currency higher a congress win or a modi victory far short of a majority would likely be trouble the central bank may have been pressured into easing monetary policy at a time when inflation is rising otherwise india s economy looks healthy with solid growth and modest stable levels of debt

as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate nevertheless the minutes also noted that some participants believed if the economy evolved as they expected they would view it as appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate later this year this view keeps the case for another hike in 2019 alive regarding the balance sheet rolloff plan almost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the federal reserve s asset holdings later this year and options on substantially slowing the runoff were presented during the meeting more on fomc minutes fed daly balance sheet rolloff and interest rate shouldn t work at cross purposes san francisco fed president mary daly said the economy is slowing faster than she expected and tighter financial conditions slower growth abroad and rising uncertainty are also threatening to slow us growth though she added that there s nothing on the radar that says we re slipping into recession daly also said interest rates are now within a hair s breadth of neutral and she support a pause in rate hikes until there are signs of overheating at the same time she said fed should align the balance sheet policy with the patient interest rate stance those two are meant to work together and not at cross purposes she said

partnership envisaged as soon as possible eu chief negotiator michel barnier and uk secretary of state stephen barclay will follow up and progress will be reviewed in the coming days may said after meeting with juncker that i have underlined the need for us to see legally binding changes to the backstop that ensure that it cannot be indefinite that s what is required if a deal is to pass the

months and the first contraction reading since 2016 markit noted that deterioration in manufacturing sector reflects stronger falls in production and new orders also future output expectations turn negative for the first time since november 2012 joe hayes economist at ihs markit said the data reflected sharper reductions in demand and production and underlying business conditions are unfavourable and this was further highlighted by output expectations turning negative for the first time in over six years which comes as no surprise given the international headwinds japanese manufacturers are facing such as a china slowdown and the global trade cycle losing further steam he added that unless service sector activity can offset manufacturing weakness the chance of japan

opinions of thursday 21 february 2019 columnist seth terkper part 1 of this article drew attention to the section of the 2019 budget that provided a non comprehensive yet high bailout or public debt of the financial sector restructuring it noted that the continuing incidence of this debt and associated spending loss of incomes and levies such as esla falls on taxpayers investors depositors as well as employees and their families part 2 continues with some non exclusive limits imposed on the economy namely limits to spending and economic activity secondly the full extent of mof contingent liability for current bailout costs as well as potential losses and risks will be unclear in the short term hence while we note the potential benefits of bog s bold measures in strengthening the banking sector the full costs for the economy and stakeholders will take time to assess as the losses risks and guarantees crystallize cost to overall economy the banking sector measures appear to contribute to the slowdown in the overall performance of the economy through the dampening effect of financial services however despite signs of a global recovery from 2017 ghana s non oil gdp growth was flat between fy2016 and 2017 in contrast overall gdp was positive due to a rising oil prices b tripling of crude gas output from prior year investments and c improved power supply due to emergency plants and repairs to the west africa gas pipeline line wagpl we do not attribute the decline in overall gdp growth rates to the services sector only however in contrast with the oil sector the services sector which is the largest with 49 to 51 per cent of gdp has underperformed graphical data from the 2019 budget buttresses the point that this adverse trend will persist and keep the financial services sector in recession through fy2021 can the banking sector grow in isolation since the accepted norm appears to be periodic bog edicts on capital increases we ask if the banking sector can grow in isolation to support the cash calls the following factors should make us caution in making such an assumption global financial crisis the current restructuring program is sobering against the background of adverse impact of a decade long global financial crisis on advanced emerging and developing economies in recent months the imf us federal reserve and other agencies have

commodity prices 2 weak domestic buffers our suggest that ghana is affected by the impact of volatility in global demand and consequently decline in commodity prices typically we lose foreign exchange reserves and tax revenue on account of the slowdown in economic activity this implies it will be difficult for the banking sector to depend on growth of the economy to meet bog s recapitalization calls hence the policy will likely continue to favour banks with external owners to augment these periodic bog cash injections austerity or easing the positive outcomes of ghana s 2014 imf ecf program

in gas supply and effect on the power supply dumsor failure of the single spine wage rationalization program excessive subsidies and banking sector npls we conclude that the financial sector restructuring must take account of a domestic and global economic environment that goes through frequent booms and busts we have started to build fiscal buffers especially the use of petroleum revenues to set up the stabilization fund to manage these hiccups typically we rely on austerity measures to manage this crisis and therefore mof cannot afford to spend significant loan and tax proceeds to underwrite failed public and private investments any prolonged banking crisis will adversely affect the economy but its resolution must not ignore the required balance in allocating scarce resources among competing needs taxation loans and recoveries the two options that countries use to resolve bank failures are to dissolve or liquidate them and preempt failure through bailouts or clean up the mess with fiscal resources we could be impervious to the alternative of using tax resources if we always assume that mof will backstop the restructuring for fear of harming the economy eventually after three major global economic crises i e the 1930s 1970s and 2008 to date the advanced states have taken a lead in forging a compromise between the two options the schemes for resolving bank failures cover shareholder responsibility bad banks to deal expeditiously with npls and levies on the banking sector for deposit insurance and other expenditures another practice is to pay the gains from successful restructuring programs to the treasury to mitigate the cost to taxpayers as central banks in the us and uk have done with gains from their quantitative easing programs the compromises prevent a moral hazard from two sources the tendency for financial authorities to take the gains but pass on costs and failure to protect stakeholders such as taxpayers depositors and employees the search for an alternative policy stance that is sustainable and measured in terms of shocks to the economy is consistent with debt management policies that guard against the risk of debt

a healthy financial sector is a function of overall growth since deposits and credits fuel an efficient economy we expect drastic reforms to prolong the lag in recovery the key lesson is to avoid parochial fiscal and monetary policies that result in losses for the common good it is clear that any legislation and regulations must go beyond core banking to cover other non bank financial institutions ghana barely escaped the recession that affected many ssa countries as recently as 2014 to 2016 and we must endeavour to avoid policies that lead to bailouts that affect investments and

belarus is prepared to merge with russia belarussian president alexander lukashenko said on february 15 following a three day summit with russian president vladimir putin the two of us could unite tomorrow no problem lukashenko said in a video posted by kremlin reporter dmitry smirnov we re ready to unite and consolidate our efforts states and peoples as far as we re ready it is true that lukashenko has built a reputation over the years of skillfully resisting political and economic pressure from abroad partly with statements that sound conciliatory but are largely empty and in his recent remarks he was careful to add that such a merger would only happen if the belarussian people are ready for it which is something both sides know is not presently the case but lukashenko s remarks still deserve attention because in a world of rising authoritarianism the will of the people matters less and less in our january 2018 issue trumpet executive editor stephen flurry wrote about the shift toward authoritarianism for nearly two centuries the dominant geopolitical trend in the world was the spread of democratic free societies he wrote this century will be totally different the dominant trend thus far has been the rise of authoritarian strongmen having kept an iron hold on the belarusian presidency since 1994 lukashenko is an authoritarian in his own right but putin is the man to watch in this situation he is the heavyweight in the dynamic and has a tight grip on russia and also a considerable one on lukashenko and all of belarus putin also has three solid reasons to want to bring belarus officially under his control and lukashenko s statements may indicate that putin has decided to soon act on them soviet reunion first putin has called the collapse of the soviet union the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century and he longs to rebuild it the soviet union included belarus ukraine georgia and 11 other republics situated in the russian periphery it brought the peoples of these nations under the control of the russian leadership putin wishes the soviet union never fell he longs for the days when all those nations were forged into one under the soviet hammer and he has been actively working to rebuild it putin s 2008 invasion of georgia which puts 20 percent of the country under russian control was part of these efforts his 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula and slicing off the country s southeast was also part of the rebuilding strategy as for belarus it is already deeply linked to russia the two militaries have intimate relations belarus is a member of the collective security treaty organization csto and the eurasian economic union eeu both instruments of russian power the two nations have even worked toward full scale unity by forming a commonwealth 20 years ago called the union state of russia and belarus it is clear that in several significant but unofficial ways belarus is part of russia but in putin s quest to rebuild the soviet union unofficial may not always be enough rally round the flag second putin would like to give russians cause to celebrate his rule once again a january poll by the moscow based public opinion research center found that the russian people s trust in putin had fallen to 33 percent its lowest level in 13 years that rating is more socially significant in russia than it would be elsewhere george friedman wrote for geopolitical futures it could indicate deep discontent arising among the russians he wrote the number has slipped from its peak partly due to decreasing household incomes and a contentious decision by putin s government to raise the retirement age to a figure just over the average man s life expectancy i remind you 43 percent of males in russia will not live until their retirement age one russian citizen tweeted after learning the news but the russian people are inclined to forget their personal suffering and grievances with the government if they see the nation acting forcefully abroad in 2006 and 2007 putin s popularity and trust ratings were worryingly low but after russia invaded georgia in 2008 those numbers surged over the next few years the numbers slowly declined but again in 2014 after putin s annexation of the crimean peninsula they soared into the stratosphere his trust rating peaked at 71 percent more than double the current figure putin well knows this recent history and the correlation with his popularity he understands that his primary achievement in the eyes of average russians has been making russia great again with aggressive foreign policy moves if his numbers continue falling he may calculate that the best way to reverse the trend is by bringing belarus officially under russian control this would be particularly important if putin decides to hand over some of the disputed kuril islands to japan in order to make peace and thereby unlock massive japanese investment into russia giving the kurils away would be wildly unpopular among russian nationalists but the move could be more than offset if russia were to simultaneously absorb belarus czar putin beyond 2024 the russian constitution says the president may serve no more than two consecutive terms this means putin will theoretically be obligated to step down when his present term ends in 2024 but putin like most authoritarian leaders throughout the ages relishes his power and will seek to prolong it this is partly because going into retirement would be risky since he could never be sure of any personal security promises his successor may make to him it is also partly because in the words of author richard risch tyrants are willing to commit to anything including mass murder to maintain their domination and for putin the constitutional limitation is an obstacle only on paper he already sidestepped it once back in 2008 after completing two consecutive four year presidential terms putin handed the presidency over to his subservient protégé dmitry medvedev and stepped into the office of prime minister during this time putin continued operating as the ruler of russia in all but official title essentially using medvedev as a puppet also in 2008 the government extended the presidential term to six years effective upon the next election in 2012 putin returned to the presidency with a newly extended six year presidential term his rule over russia was official once again and he won a second six year term last year when his current term ends in 2024 there is a chance putin will orchestrate another rendition of this castling move with medvedev or some other trusted protégé there is also a chance that putin will amend the constitution so that he can stay in power after 2024 but both moves are politically risky and with belarus there is another option available back in 1997 lukashenko and putin s predecessor boris yeltsin signed the framework treaty for the union state of russia and belarus a 1999 update of the deal describes what is basically a federation of two states with a single flag a single currency a common market and an integrated judiciary the deal stipulates that the union is to be governed by a supreme state council with the presidents of the two countries taking turns as head unless they agree otherwise since 2000 lukashenko has led the union but both sides have thus far prevented it from having much actual power or relevance if putin took the reins of the union state of russia and belarus he could imbue the entity with real power by taking charge of a vastly strengthened supreme state council putin could potentially become more powerful than whomever may succeed him as russian president and all without having to amend or sidestep the constitution the bible foretells a russian prince the trumpet carefully watches vladimir putin and his grip on power because of what bible prophecy says about his role in end time events around the year a d 90 the apostle john was inspired to write a sobering prophecy and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them revelation 9 16 this is discussing a military force of 200 million soldiers which is more people than were alive at the time this was written the scriptures provide several important details about this largest armed force ever amassed revelation 16 12 labels the force as the kings of the east showing it to be a group of mainly oriental countries a prophecy in ezekiel 38 2 mentions a prince of rosh meshech and tubal young s literal translation meshech and tubal are ancient names designating the modern russian cities of moscow and tobolsk and rosh is a variation of an ancient name for russia several encyclopedias and commentaries such as the jamieson fausset and brown commentary recognize this in the september 2014 trumpet editor in chief gerald flurry identified this powerful russian prince i strongly believe vladimir putin is going to lead the 200 million man army just look at the power he already has can you think of any other russian politician who could become so powerful and have the will to lead russia into the crisis of crises i see nobody else on the horizon who could do that and only a tiny few years remain for the prince of rosh to appear this much is absolutely certain the restoring of russia s power by vladimir putin the prince of russia was prophesied parts of this prince of rosh prophecy have already been fulfilled and mr flurry believes putin will remain in power to fulfill even more of it so whether putin retains power by becoming head of a russia belarus union alters or sidesteps russia s constitution or if the world descends into conflict before the question becomes pressing the trumpet believes putin will be the main power over russia during the most chaotic and violent period in mankind s history despite how it sounds this is not all bad news in his booklet the prophesied prince of russia mr flurry writes that though catastrophe looms on the horizon there is profound hope at the heart of these prophecies about russia he writes that the fact putin is now in power proves that the most hope filled event in mankind s history is near mr putin s warfare is going to lead directly into the second coming of christ vladimir putin is a sign literally a sign that jesus christ is about to return he writes this is one of the most inspiring messages in the bible mr flurry continues what we are seeing in russia ultimately leads to the transition from man ruling man to god ruling man and it is almost here it is just a few short years away we have to realize that this is all good news because jesus christ is going to return to this earth at the very end of the coming world war the powers fighting the war are going to be destroyed by jesus christ himself jesus christ is about to return biblical prophecy makes that clear surely we ought to be studying our bibles and understanding these prophecies they have such deep meaning and are so important to you to understand these bible passages and the danger and the hope that is tied into them order your free copy of mr flurry s

in europe the dow jones stoxx 600 is little changed in the morning and continued to flirt with the 200 day moving average soft data in asia saw japanese and australian yields slip and while peripheral european yields followed core yields are one to two basis points firmer iron ore and gold prices are softer oil prices are little changed putting at risk the six day advance asia pacific australia is very much in focus today the flash pmi was poor the manufacturing pmi eased to 53 1 from 53 9 but the real shock was the dramatic weakness in the service pmi which is often seen as more a reflection of the domestic economy than trade it fell to 49 3 from 51 0 this report was followed by favorable jobs data the economy grew more than twice as many jobs as expected almost 40k of these more than 65k were full time jobs the most since june 2017 the participation rate ticked up but the unemployment rate was steady at 5 0 the australian dollar came under pressure when a local bank forecast two rate hikes this year however the aussie recovered fully but then was hit anew on reports that one port dalian has banned australian coal the full details are not known or if this is a wider action japan s pmi disappointed the flash manufacturing pmi fell to 48 5 from 50 3 it is the second sharp drop after finishing last year at 53 6 it is the first contraction sub 50 reading in 2 5 years both new

side of jpy110 75 in contrast the australian dollar has a wide range today it traded on both sides of yesterday s range and is trading below yesterday s low 0 7140 it is hovering around 0 7100 in the european morning where an a 565 mln option expires later today a convincing break of the 0 7050 area would complete a potential bearish chart pattern head and shoulders top whose measuring objective is near 0 6800 europe the flash pmi readings are mixed in europe but the beginnings of a recovery may be hinted with today s report germany s service sector was strong at 55 1 from 53 0 but the

recovered from 48 2 but at 49 9 did not quite get back to expansion mode above 50 the german manufacturing sector is more exposed to china and may also still be adversely impacted by the changes in the auto sector though that seems to be fading there are several brexit developments to be aware of today first late yesterday fitch put the uk s aa rating on negative watch due to uncertainty over brexit and the risks of a disruptive no deal exit the sterling initially softened in response the rise in 10 year gilt yields today are in line with the us and germany second and more importantly new wording around the backstop may be are being hammered out according to reports brexit secretary barclay and the attorney general cox are in brussels today with proposed changes that ostensibly would be acceptable to parliament the spanish foreign minister appeared to confirm that this is in the works still many european officials do not seem convinced that this will satisfy the house of commons which is likely to vote again next week third reports suggest that as many as 15 government officials may vote against may s bill next week it would likely cost a minister their job but if 15 defect it will be more difficult to exert party discipline which in any event seems at a low ebb given the reports of cabinet in fighting the euro has re entered the 1 13 1 15 trading range after pushing lower last week however it has not been able to move above its 20 day moving average 1 1365 which is just shy of the 50 retracement of this month s decline 1 1375 there is an option that will be cut today at 1 1365 for about 665 mln euros there are nearly 3 bln euros in options at 1 1400 05 that also expire today and 1 2 bln euros at 1 13 the record from the recent ecb meeting is still on tap today and although we know the meeting s outcome was dovish the intraday technicals seem to favor a firmer euro the sterling is firm within yesterday s range it is likely to remain range bound until news from brussels talks is reported perhaps later today there is an option for about gbp210 mln at 1 3055 that expires today which is very much in play presently america yesterday s fomc meetings confirmed the shift in the fed s posture it was spooked by the incredible market volatility and the sharp slowdown overseas investors learned that nearly all fed officials are on board with ending the balance sheet reduction before the end of the year the exact modalities still need to be worked out like will the unwind taper like the purchases and if the balance sheet will be treasuries over time will the fed sell mbs and roll into treasuries aggressive or will it simply be maturing mbs proceeds into treasuries which also raises questions of maturities at the same time it is important to recognize that the fed kept a mild tightening bias the discussions were over under what conditions would the fed resume hikes there did not seem to be a discussion of cuts the us china trade talks

trump tomorrow after this week s talks the political climate in the us is such that trump s critics are not concerned that he will push for too strong of a deal but rather that he will claim victory

the soft patch in the us economy that looks to have begun in q4 18 appears to have carried into q1 19 aided by the government shutdown and the bitter cold durable goods orders for december will allow

a slowing global economy and increasing strain on businesses from a year long sino u s trade war are tilting central banks from japan to australia towards monetary easing in a remarkable 180 degree turn late last year the debate in japan was focused on the demerits of printing money and the reserve bank of australia rba was adamant the next likely move in rates will be up an emerging market currency sell off was seen forcing externally vulnerable economies such as india indonesia and the philippines to keep tightening their policy rates but even they are now subject to rate cut bets a softer dollar and lower oil prices played an important role in the turnaround but crucially for asia regional growth engine china is having a worse than expected start to the year and is exporting disinflation to the rest of the region the federal reserve last month adopted a more cautious approach in a shift that signalled its tightening cycle might be at an end what s obviously happening is that central banks are rethinking monetary policy said piyush gupta ceo of dbs group holdings in singapore with the exception of philippines which is also witnessing rapid disinflation all major asian economies are now facing inflation rates at the lower end or even below their central banks target price growth is sub 1 percent in malaysia singapore south korea taiwan and thailand underlying price pressures are remarkably soft and broadly falling frederic neumann co head of asian economics research at hsbc said the case for further monetary easing may thus become more pressing even if in itself this may not be enough to push up growth materially on tuesday bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda said the central bank was ready to boost stimulus if sharp yen rises hurt the economy and its price goal also in tokyo on the same day bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp deputy governor diwa guinigundo said the central bank which hiked five times last year will act swiftly if liquidity conditions aren t sufficient to maintain economic momentum earlier this month the rba shifted to a neutral stance from its previous tightening bias but an increasing number of economists polled by reuters are predicting a cut india s central bank unexpectedly lowered interest rates in february and analysts are tipping another cut of the three major economies running current account deficits indonesia is the only one where expectations for a policy reversal after six hikes last year are extremely low as the central bank is more focused on exchange rate stability bsp is more likely to take a surprise earlier turn in its monetary policy bias than bi given the central bank s growth bias and rapidly slowing growth momentum said juliana lee asia chief economist at deutsche bank china liquidity at this stage economists don t see chances of more than one cut in any asian economy but much will depend on how china performs whether its trade dispute with the united states is resolved and how successful beijing s stimulus efforts are in january the people s bank of china pboc slashed the reserve requirement ratio rrr by 100 basis points and analysts expect another 150 bps of cuts by year end on top of other fiscal stimulus measures expected in march some economists do expect a cut in benchmark interest rates but the consensus is that such a move would only come as a last resort given that it could hurt the yuan and reignite debt risks only if internal and external environments change drastically will cutting benchmark saving and lending rates become much more likely icbc analysts said in a note source reuters reporting by marius zaharia editing by shri navaratnam

trump and the world economy economy international relations february 21 2019 martin thomas and leo panitch leo panitch interviewed by martin thomas of solidarity martin thomas mt i can see four main sorts of possible outcomes to be considered from trump s economic jousting one it may reshape some deals like nafta to the usa s advantage or imagined advantage but after a flurry relations in the world markets will settle down much as before two by generally shaking up trade relations and putting pressure on some of china s protectionist policies economic life around the world may settle after the jousting into a more globalized form more subject to world market rules three the jousting leaves a world market system operating in much the same way as now but with the usa now a rogue state on the edge of it rather than the pivotal state in the system maybe the system is organized around a new pivot maybe china four the jousting begins a serious unravelling of the world market order a contraction of supply chains a re raising of trade barriers a push to economic nationalism the shift is moderate and limited for now but escalates in the next big economic crisis some articles in the new socialist register argue cogently that the third option is not a real possibility what do you think about the others and does this list map out accurately the possibilities we should consider leo panitch lp the list is about right the main question though is will the effects of trump s regime not just his antics at an international level but his presidency itself be to render the key american state institutions that have been responsible for firefighting financial crises incapable of being effective firefighters mt yes as you argue in your book with sam gindin the making of global capitalism the current world market order has not just evolved automatically it has been made and managed by the u s state lp the u s is already acting as a rogue state under trump but the system is so dependent on the role of the u s state within it and the american economy and the american dollar so that it is difficult to see how the system can dispense with the centrality of the united states if trump s effects are longstanding we may face a very dysfunctional system but one that is not open to reorganization in that framework and with the rise of right wing xenophobic nationalisms with some added militarist dimensions i fear that this could lead to conditions of extreme nationalisms facing off against each other the limiting aspect is the degree of integration of the world bourgeoisies with one another the kind of shift that the ruhr industrialists undertook between 1928 and 1932 to back the nazis is hard to see as on the cards given the degree of capitalist integration that s where the cloudy crystal ball leaves us mt the centrality of the u s in managing the world economic order has not diminished despite the 2008 crash and despite the fiasco of u s policy in iraq china s holdings of treasury paper are bigger than they were not smaller the dollar s role in world trade has increased not diminished lp yes 88 per cent of transactions are now conducted through the dollar mt at the time of the invasion of iraq in 2003 a common theory about it was that the usa was doing it in order to head off the euro taking over from the dollar at the centre of world trade lp there were possibly policy makers in the united states who thought that way there were certainly loads of left wing commentators who explained it that way neither group had much purchase on reality as we see with trump sometimes u s policies are undertaken for reasons which are delusional but most of the arguments inside the bush administration were i think opportunist of a militarist kind or about re establishing the supremacy of the executive vis à vis congress why the argument about the euro becoming the vehicle currency for iraqi oil sales leading to its replacing the dollar as the world currency was other worldly even if you sold oil in euros those could be exchanged in milliseconds for dollars insofar as big capitalists institutional funds corporations and so on find the dollar more useful it is for a multitude of specific reasons to each of them the dollar doesn t hang there in mid air its role is embedded in a set of institutions and practices and skills and knowledge which capitalists pay one another for the centrality of the city of london in changing the world s currencies into dollars through derivatives markets and so on is deeply embedded in the institutions of the city of london including the american banks operating there and the capitalist skills and knowledge built over centuries of british merchant banking there is no other set of institutions now capable of replacing them and that s why although there will be some marginal movements of jobs from the city of london even the bank of england s most recent warnings about the effects of brexit do not talk about the city of london being displaced from the role it plays in the dollar markets of the world in this very dysfunctional world affected by trump s ascension to the presidency it is remarkable that the dollar continues to have its centrality that s partly because the american economy has done relatively well compared to others in the decade since the fourth great crisis of capitalism but it is also to do with the centrality of the institutions which sustain the dollar in the quotidian workings of global capitalism but in the end it is because of capitalists confidence in the american state as the ultimate guarantor of property and value and wealth and capital that the dollar remains so central mt in your socialist register article with sam gindin trumping the empire you refer to the possibility of the central banks becoming the saviour of the existing order lp this is a great irony the motivation that drove making central banks independent from elected governments especially in the era of globalization over the last 30 or 40 years with the imf virtually dictating to states that central banks must be made independent was precisely to remove them from democratic pressures above all the motivation was the fear that working people as voters would opt for monetary policies that would provide room for wage increases that would open the inflationary space that governments have been guarding against since they defeated trade unions in the 1970s and early 1980s now these right wing patriotic scoundrels who are being elected find that they can t force the central banks to do their bidding so easily above all trump and in relation to the federal reserve that really matters there is plenty of evidence that the treasury is being severely hampered by the trump administration in the role it can play as a firefighter and as a functional actor in the global system you see that in the g20 meeting in argentina the g20 is essentially a creation of the united states treasury which always wrote the communiqués that were then signed by the finance ministers or by the heads of state now its is the senior officials of the other finance ministries who have to scramble to produce consensual texts and the g20 can t get the u s to sign on to them just recently the financial times commented on the appointment of randal quarles to head the world financial stability board quarles has been a long time senior figure in the federal reserve a smart functionary of the reproduction of capitalist social relations at a global level the fsb created in the wake of the 2008 crisis was headed by mark carney before him and before that by mario draghi the appointment of quarles indicates that the fed is putting a lot of resources into infrastructure which will keep the links between the european central bank the bank of england and the federal reserve of a kind that will allow them to do the super intendence over the transfers of dollars between the central banks and the general sort of coordination and firefighting that was done after 2008 that would indicate that the system is not quite as dysfunctional as it appears to be mt you ve discussed the possibility that the end effect of trump s jousting will be to open up the chinese economy more to world markets lp ever since trump was elected you ve seen the chinese especially xi plugging the theme that the united states needs to live up to its global responsibilities china is the capitalist late developer which has relied most in the whole history of capitalist development on foreign direct investment in our essay in the new socialist register gindin and i quote xi saying this earlier this year to a group of visiting foreign capitalists that they are going to remove some of their restrictions on foreign capital becoming majority owners of chinese firms and on foreign financial institutions operating in china removing those restrictions on foreign financial institutions has long been a main goal of wall street and previous american administrations to allow a larger role in china for goldman sachs and the rest of them the chinese have also signalled that they will not be protecting as much their rights to technology transfer when firms invest in china so xi is prepared to move quite a distance there are internal pressures from many chinese capitalists themselves who want a loosening of china s capital controls the chinese are very much the takers of this trade war they are responding to be sure in ways which are designed to inflict some harm on for example american farmers producing soy which is exported to china and are having some effects on u s construction companies who rely on chinese wood products but the chinese are not leading this trade war they are trying to find ways to mollify trump all this suggests to me that it is possible that trump will get his way at the same time the chinese communist capitalists are also nationalists all of the great third world communist revolutionary movements were in very good part nationalist movements how far they can be pushed is a significant question if you read the essays by lin chun and sean starrs in socialist register 2019 the heavy dose of nationalism that defines the ideology of this chinese leadership and especially xi may mean that they can t be pushed too far on 1 december canadian authorities at the demand of the u s seeking her extradition arrested meng wanzhou chief financial officer of huawei and daughter of the founder someone who has been described as a member of chinese corporate royalty on the grounds that her firm has allegedly been involved in breaching american sanctions against iran this has produced a furore in china these things can get out of hand it would be misleading when we look at the structural conditions that put limits on the whole system falling apart to think that these contingent things can t have effect we need to watch this closely it is not only people of our political orientation who are watching washington with bated breath american capitalists and the world s capitalists are watching with bated breath mt it s said that the economic jousting between the usa and china isn t fundamentally about tariffs and trade it s about technology transfer and the u s wanting to maintain its technological lead lp that s an important dimension a lot is done in the u s for example on microchips to limit the chinese to being assemblers the chinese have a very explicit goal of becoming by the 2030s fully adept in the technologies themselves it is clearly a concern of the americans the technology transfer issue has long term economic dimensions to it but it also has military strategic intelligence dimensions it does reflect some of the kinds of behaviour and motivations that defined the old inter imperial rivalries some of it has to do with the capacities of rival military and security apparatuses the fact that china and russia are not in nato and are not in the global intelligence and security establishment that operates under the rubric of the united states the so called five eyes anglo american countries usa uk canada australia new zealand are at the core of that establishment the key historical determinant even of clinton s and blair s view of the world was that russia and china were not subjected to postwar state reconstruction by american military occupation as japan and western europe were mt the new socialist register has material expressing a sceptical view on the prospects of the belt and road initiative lp yes i think we have to take the evidence on this in the outstanding essays by sean starrs and lin chun very seriously they show very clearly not only the economic contradictions which have emerged with the belt and road initiative but also the extent to which china is seen by many other states in southeast asia in the light of a an imperial power posing the main threat to their national sovereignty this is what most people overlook when they see china as forming asia as a whole into a regional counter power to the usa and especially in south east asia china is seen by other nationalist forces as their main enemy that dimension is largely overlooked when people speak of a multipolar world in which china dominates asia as well as the economic limits of the belt and road initiative there is a very important historical cultural nationalist imperial dimension mt world capitalism is much more integrated in the late 20s and early 30s and you mentioned that when saying that it is hard to think of the bourgeoisie in any country swinging behind ultra nationalist forces as heavy industry in germany swung behind the nazis but there s another variant historically in the period up to world war one people like bernstein would argue that the degree of integration of capital across borders was such as to make war less and less likely writers like trotsky responded that it was an integration which tended to set up large rival alliances the world order became one not just of molecular struggles between states but of jousting between large rival alliances that created the conditions for world war one there was a lot of talk in the early 90s about world capitalism developing into three great regional blocs one dominated by the u s one dominated by the eu and one dominated by japan it was mistaken what you ve said about china is an argument against reviving that regional bloc thesis today does that mean the thesis is pretty much ruled out lp who knows karl kautsky 1854 1938 around world war one saw a ruling class condominium developing among the big capitalist states along the lines of the paris discussions which led to the treaty of versailles it didn t turn out to be all that stable did it the flaw in kautsky s understanding was that he saw it as a matter of coordination among ruling classes who were accumulating still within the boundaries of their own states or territorial empires but especially in the second half of the 20th century there was an interpenetration of capital around the world the material structural underpinning to the trade and investment agreements made by governments it became a different world than that of world war one the question we began discussing today was whether the political effects of the current trump administration will be so dysfunctional as to get in the way of the reproduction of the integration this is so important to analyse precisely because the economic integration has also produced contradictions which are increasingly severe in the 21st century these contradictions partly have to do with the crisis prone nature of the very volatile global financial system which is essential to tying together global production they also have to do with the domestic consequences in class terms of the ever greater inequalities of power income and wealth which this integrated capitalism produces as states compete to get capital landing inside of them insofar as the world we are living in is increasingly prone to severe contradictions extending beyond the two i have mentioned to all kinds of morbid symptoms ranging from the climate crisis to the migration crisis and the xenophobia that attends it we need to see those symptoms as opening up possibilities in terms of revolutionary transformations within particular states which would then have international implications but at the same time given the weaknesses of the left and of the working classes those transformations are not going to be triggered by the type of events we ve seen in paris that is another round of inflammatory protest movements since the 1930s some trotskyist analysis has been premised on the notion that capitalism is over ripe for revolution and thus its fall can be triggered by unexpected conflagrations of any type which will then have international effects like a falling row of dominoes i am not of the view that capitalism is in its material base over ripe for revolution mt i agree i know that idea has become a common theme in would be trotskyist literature but i think it comes more from third period stalinism lp so it does
a look at russia s books suggests vladimir putin is preparing for war though not necessarily the kind involving the invincible hypersonic missiles and nuclear torpedoes he s been bragging about for a year putin s quietly built a financial fortress that government officials and kremlin advisers say will safeguard the economy from the escalating salvos they see coming all while keeping the u s and its allies guessing about russia s military capabilities and intentions it s a goal putin s been pursuing since he rose to power at the turn of the millennium one that s gained urgency with each new crisis with the west during the global credit squeeze a decade ago russia s main stock index lost three fourths of its value five years ago the ruble halved against the dollar in the wake of collapsing oil prices and the imposition of sanctions over ukraine triggering the longest recession of his rule now russia is growing again despite adopting one of the most tightfisted budgets of any major economy this year s total spending bill about 270 billion is less than half the pentagon s and russia is collecting more rubles than it s disbursing the country was one of only three in the group of 20 to run a surplus last year and its debt burden is by far the lowest in the club bloomberg the turnaround can be traced to a decision putin made at a closed door meeting with his economic advisers in the fall of 2016 that surprised even the most fiscally hawkish among them according to three people familiar with the matter russia was about to codify a requirement to sequester all oil revenue above a particular price point and putin chose the most pessimistic scenario presented to him 40 a barrel less than half the average for the previous decade what made the decision so remarkable these people said was the political risks it entailed putin was heading toward elections with a shrinking economy while managing a high stakes military intervention in syria and bracing for what looked certain to be a white house victory for hillary clinton a virulent critic who d just compared him to adolf hitler instead of loosening the purse strings to appease the competing domestic groups that undergird his system of governance he yanked them tight putin cut spending across the board including defense to replenish russia s rainy day fund at the same time the central bank was refueling its reserves after abandoning a costly defense of the ruble to focus on amassing gold and yuan liquidating most of its u s treasury bills without warning putin is accumulating savings because they give him power said andrei kolesnikov a political analyst at the carnegie moscow center he needs money to fight the west to deal with intensifying sanctions and to address future economic crises debt rating services and financial institutions like the international monetary fund are applauding albeit with caution in light of repeated threats of more punitive action from washington and brussels moody s this month followed s p in restoring russia s credit score to investment grade saying the country s balance sheet has become bulletproof enough to absorb the likely impact of the additional sanctions its analysts are expecting but putin s austerity drive is eating away at the considerable cache of political capital he s amassed during his tenure in the kremlin the longest since josef stalin growth is anemic real incomes continue to decline interest rates remain relatively high inflation is picking up and the steady hikes in state pensions that were hallmarks of earlier terms have plateaued adding to the distrust that has dragged putin s approval rating to a decade low is a law he signed after his landslide victory last march that raises the retirement age by five years the cost saving measure was widely opposed in a country where most people were born under communism leading to a rare outbreak of protests a hike in the value added tax is further eroding purchasing power stoking a rise in consumer debt and deepening public discontent the leadership of our country decided on a highly conservative scenario save up as much as possible and spend as little as possible said yaroslav kuzminov the dean of the higher school of economics in moscow the goal now is to preserve what s been achieved macroeconomic and budget stability even at the expense of spurring growth a favorite putin metric the central bank s reserves has risen by about 125 billion in the past four years to 475 billion the stockpile the world s fifth largest is still well shy of the 598 billion peak reached in 2008 when oil flirted with 150 a barrel russia s sequestration mechanism and wealth fund are modeled on norway s system for hedging against fluctuations in crude prices and ensuring future pensions but unlike norway which rarely taps its 1 trillion hoard in oslo officials in moscow drain russia s pool whenever times get tough according to karen vartapetov a debt analyst at s p bloomberg

mining costs declined cash costs per payable ounce of gold sold in 2018 were 723 higher than the 647 per payable ounce of gold sold in 2017 mainly due to higher leach pad opening inventory unit costs in 2018 relative to 2017 aisc in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 995 per payable ounce of gold sold compared to 965 in the third quarter due to increased capital spending mostly related to mobile equipment and construction of a new leach pad aisc of 974 per payable ounce of gold sold in 2018 increased from 896 in 2017 primarily due to higher capital investments and exploration partially offset by lower capitalized stripping mine sales a total of 50 550 ounces of gold were sold at an average realized price of 1 227 per ounce during the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease of 15 from the 59 612

average gold grade of 0 47 g t drilling activities during the fourth quarter of 2018 targeted infill drilling and upgrade of mineral resources at red dot and growth at various phases of the mackay pit with work also targeting resource addition this is consistent with our longer term objective of completing the necessary infill and geotechnical drilling to complete pit designs and an economic evaluation over the entire red dot area by mid year 2019 during the quarter we completed 21 260 meters of drilling in 60 reverse circulation rc holes at the mackay pit and within the red dot area rc drilling for the year totaled 93 276 meters in 259 rc holes following our exploration news release of november 6 2018 we have received results from an additional 33 rc drill holes that targeted mineral resource portions of the red dot deposit and its northern extensions this contributed in part to success in achieving our objective of converting mineral resources to mineral reserves for 2019

million ounces this compares to 6 0 million ounces of silver sold in 2017 exploration at puna operations exploration activities were limited to the collection of detailed drone magnetic data at chinchillas and the pirquitas mine areas in 2018 we evaluated the potential for an underground mine at the pirquitas deposit to provide supplemental ore to the pirquitas mill the study confirmed a technically feasible and economic project however with a return below our investment thresholds at current metal prices we have budgeted 1 million in 2019 for a 3 000 meter drill program to test for extensions to the mineralization that could have a positive impact on the project economics chinchillas project argentina during the fourth quarter pre stripping activities at the chinchillas project were completed ore haulage met required tonnages and commercial production was declared on december 1 2018 ore feed to the pirquitas plant has been sourced from the chinchillas mine since that date metallurgical recovery performance of the chinchillas ore has met or exceeded design construction of the in pit tailings pumping and delivery system is complete the slurry pumps have been pre commissioned and the tailings pipeline hydraulic test finished the water reclaim pipeline has been hydrostatically tested and the pumps installed in the barges the power line to the pumps is finished

mobile fleet as well as 10 million for accelerated leach pad construction and process infrastructure to accommodate the higher ore tonnes mined and to provide additional operating flexibility regarding leach cycles construction of a leach pad is expected to be accelerated to the second half of 2019 from 2020 capitalized stripping is expected to total 20 million with the majority incurred through the first three quarters of the year exploration expenditures totaling 7 5 million re focuses to mackay valmy and basalt with the goals of adding mineral reserves and defining additional mineral resources within these areas having completed the red dot exploration program in 2018 we intend to complete geotechnical drilling and engineering of the remaining red dot mineral resources with the objective of evaluating the potential for additional red dot mineral reserves by mid 2019 at the seabee gold operation we expect to continue executing our plan of increasing mining and milling rates and to deliver another record gold production year in 2019 the plan includes investment of 7 million in underground mining equipment to increase capacity and reliability with higher tonnes mined and demonstrated milling infrastructure capacity cash costs are expected to remain low at between 525 and 555 per payable gold ounce sold due to continued exploration success at seabee we are embarking on an expansion to tailings capacity in excess of that contemplated in the 2017 technical report the first phase is expected to be completed in 2019 at an investment of 15 million with

strategy for the santoy complex exploration expenditures at seabee total 6 million to continue underground exploration at depth expansion of santoy gap hw and continued testing of surface targets at puna operations with commercial production of the chinchillas open pit achieved 2019 marks the first anticipated full year of ore production from the chinchillas mine transported for processing at the pirquitas mill puna is expected to produce between 6 0 and 7 0 million ounces of silver at cash costs of between 8 00 and 10 00 per payable silver ounce sold reported cash costs may vary quarter to quarter due to the by product credits arising from the production of lead and zinc as such credits vary based on the timing of sales of each concentrate capital investments at puna of 12 million include 5 million for mine equipment maintenance and 5 million for plant equipment maintenance capitalized stripping is elevated through 2019 as the mine completes the highwall pushback and commences stripping the next phase of the chinchillas pit as chinchillas operations ramp up through 2019 only waste material will be mined over certain periods of the year with ore stockpiled during the pre production phase transported to and processed at the pirquitas mill with puna focused on optimization of the mine transport and mill operations through 2019 limited exploration expenditures of 1 million are planned in the second half of the year as previously announced the completion of certain chinchillas project infrastructure carries over into 2019 with the remaining investment of approximately 9 million expected to be incurred in the first quarter the project remains on budget in addition to exploration at our three operating mines we expect to invest 3 million in exploration

please see cautionary note regarding non gaap measures quarterly financial summary revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased by 4 relative to the comparative quarter in 2017 due principally to lower gold and silver prices gold production was similar to the comparative quarter but gold sales were approximately 3 000 ounces lower due to timing of shipments silver production was also similar to the comparative quarter as commercial production was reached at the chinchillas mine on december 1 2018 providing a strong finish to the quarter as the pirquitas plant transitioned to solely chinchillas ore silver sales increased marginally relative to the comparative quarter but the increase did not offset the factors discussed above sales of lead and zinc commenced in the quarter with the resumption of base metal production from pirquitas and chinchillas ores but sales were well below production due to timeframes required to ramp up international concentrate sales income from mine operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 generated a gross margin of 16 lower than the 20 gross margin generated in the fourth quarter of 2017 mainly due to lower realized metal prices impacting margins at the marigold mine and puna operations relative to the comparative prior year quarter the seabee gold operation generated higher income from mine operations as lower cost and depreciation more than offset lower realized prices in the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred a net loss of 2 5 million compared to net income of 16 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 in addition to the lower metal prices and finished goods inventory build of gold and concentrates discussed above we recognized a share based compensation and payroll expense of 8 3 million principally resulting from stronger relative and absolute share price performance over the quarter we also recognized an expense of 2 8 million related to the premium paid over the prevailing market price for purchase of the shares of silvercrest metals inc silvercrest the subsequent increase in value of silvercrest shares of 4 3 million was recognized in other comprehensive income during the quarter a foreign exchange loss was recognized as the argentine peso stabilized and strengthened relative to the end of the third quarter net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 benefited from a tax recovery of 5 million cash used in operating activities was 3 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 45 2 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2017 lower metal prices combined with lower gold sales at higher unit costs more than offset higher silver sales at lower unit costs at puna operations operating activities were impacted by a 22 3 million increase in non cash working capital due to a combination of increased gold and concentrate finished goods inventories inventory in circuit at seabee gold operation chinchillas ore stockpiles at puna operations and a reduction in trade payables at year end particularly related to the chinchillas project we used 63 0 million in investing activities in the fourth quarter of 2018 we invested 23 1 million in the silvercrest share purchase 10 6 million in property plant and equipment and 18 9 million in the chinchillas project and loaned 8 million to our joint venture partner this compared to 9 6 million of cash used for investing activities in the fourth quarter of 2017 as the quarter benefited from 63 4 million of pretium share sale proceeds we received 8 8 million from our joint venture partner for its share of the development costs of the chinchillas project annual financial summary the 6 decrease in revenue for the year of 2018 compared to the year of 2017 was due to an 8 decrease in equivalent payable gold ounces sold somewhat offset by a higher average realized gold price the decrease was more than offset by lower silver ounces sold from puna operations as lower grade ore stockpiles were processed through the development of the chinchillas project income from mine operations in 2018 generated a gross margin of 18 lower than the 25 in 2017 higher sales of gold at lower cost of sales at the seabee gold operation was more than offset by lower sales of silver at puna operations and higher cost of sales at the marigold mine in the year ended december 31 2017 the release of a supplies inventory provision at puna operations and the resolution of our export duty claim in argentina resulted in a 10 5 million reduction to cost of sales increasing the 2017 reported gross margin our strong relative and absolute share price performance resulted in a 9 1 million higher share based payment expense in 2018 relative to 2017 being recognized through general and administrative expense we incurred a 2 8 million expense related to the premium paid over the prevailing market price on recording the investment in silvercrest shares the subsequent increase in value of silvercrest shares of 4 3 million was recognized in other comprehensive income we reported an elevated effective tax rate due to a 4 7 million tax expense related to the argentine re organization recorded in the second quarter of 2018 as a result a small net loss was reported in 2018 net income for 2017 benefitted by an impairment reversal of the pirquitas plant of 24 4 million resulting from its life extension following the formation of puna operations cash generated from operating activities was 59 8 million in 2018 compared to 144 7 million in 2017 higher sales and lower unit costs at the seabee gold operation were more than offset by lower sales combined with higher unit costs both at puna operations and the marigold mine non cash working capital of 36 million was incurred as finished goods and ore inventories were built across all operations and particularly related to the development and ramp up at chinchillas we used 115 9 million in investing activities in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 15 5 million used in the comparative period of 2017 in 2018 we received 63 4 million from the sales of our remaining common shares of pretium resources inc pretium while investments in our business included 67 7 million in property plant and equipment 60 2 million in the chinchillas project 23 1 million in silvercrest share purchase and loaned 8 0 million to our joint venture partner we received 15 2 million from our joint venture partner for its share of the development and operating costs of the chinchillas project corporate summary ssr mining has an experienced management team of mine builders and operators with proven capabilities we have a strong balance sheet with 419 2 million in cash and cash equivalents as at december 31 2018 we are committed to delivering safe production through relentless emphasis on operational excellence we are also focused on growing production and mineral reserves through the exploration and acquisition of assets for accretive growth while maintaining financial strength on january 1 2018 we appointed ms elizabeth a wademan and mr simon a fish to our board of directors with the objective to strengthen the board s expertise in the areas of international capital markets and legal and corporate governance on may 3 2018 we announced the appointment of kevin o kane as chief operating officer effective june 4 2018 replacing alan pangbourne who retired at the end of may 2018 on june 18 2018 we released an updated life of mine plan for the marigold mine in nevada u s which outlined an anticipated mine life of over ten years based on mineral reserves and an after tax net present value of 552 million we filed a technical report titled ni 43 101 technical report on the marigold mine humboldt county nevada usa dated july 31 2018 the marigold technical report in support of the updated life of mine plan which is available on sedar at www sedar com the edgar section of the sec website at www sec gov and on our website as of june 30 2018 we sold our remaining position of 9 0 million pretium common shares for pre tax cash proceeds of approximately 63 4 million and no longer hold any pretium shares on december 1 2018 we declared commercial production at puna operations chinchillas mine development of the mine located approximately 45 kilometers from the pirquitas plant commenced in early 2018 and extends the life of the pirquitas plant through mining of ore at chinchillas transporting the ore to pirquitas and processing it through the existing pirquitas plant on december 10 2018 we completed a transaction with silvercrest which owns the las chispas project a high grade development project in mexico to purchase by way of private placement a 9 7 ownership interest representing 8 220 645 common shares of silvercrest at a price of c 3 73 per common share for total consideration of c 30 7 million in 2018 we achieved our initial guidance for the seventh consecutive year by delivering gold equivalent production of over 345 000 ounces at cash costs of 736 and aisc of 1 087 per payable gold equivalent ounce sold successful exploration activities in 2018 increased gold mineral reserves at the marigold mine by 110 000 ounces to 3 3 million ounces and at the seabee gold operation by 39 to 608 000 ounces mineral reserves and mineral resources at december 31 2018 our total estimated proven and probable gold mineral reserves were 3 91 million ounces and total estimated silver proven and probable mineral reserves were 38 7 million ounces mineral reserves estimates for the marigold mine the seabee gold operation and puna operations have been determined based on prices of 1 250 per ounce of gold and 18 00 per ounce of silver these prices are unchanged from those used to determine the mineral reserves estimate at december 31 2017 reflecting market conditions and consensus long term metal prices all mineral resources and mineral reserves estimates are reported on a 100 basis except for puna operations mineral resources and mineral reserves estimates of silver ounces for puna operations are reported on a 75 attributable basis at marigold our 2018 exploration program led to an increase in mineral reserves probable mineral reserves increased to 3 3 million ounces of gold 201 5 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 47 g t after accounting for mining depletion and minor modeling reductions while gold grade increased to 0 47 g t the increase in probable mineral reserves is attributable to our successful infill and exploration drilling programs which converted mineral resources at a portion of red dot and mackay collectively adding 460 000 gold ounces to mineral reserves we added 350 000 ounces of gold mineral reserves at red dot which we refer to as red dot phase 1 depletion of mineral reserves due to 2018 gold production totaled 320 000 ounces indicated mineral resources inclusive of mineral reserves totaled 5 56 million ounces of gold 354 5 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 47 g t after accounting for mining depletion and mine plan optimization offset by our successful exploration program inferred mineral resources declined to 400 000 ounces of gold 33 6 million tonnes at an

with reporting standards in canada and the mineral reserves and the mineral resources estimates are made in accordance with ni 43 101 ni 43 101 is a rule developed by the canadian securities administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects these standards differ significantly from the requirements of the sec set out in sec industry guide 7 consequently mineral reserves and mineral resources information included in this news release is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by domestic u s reporting companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the sec under sec standards mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made in addition the sec s disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute reserves by u s standards in documents filed with the sec u s investors should understand that inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility moreover the requirements of ni 43 101 for identification of reserves are also not the same as those of the sec and reserves reported by us in compliance with ni 43 101 may not qualify as reserves under sec standards accordingly information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with u s standards cautionary note regarding non gaap measures this news release includes certain terms or performance

vancouver feb 21 2019 prnewswire ssr mining inc nasdaq ssrm tsx ssrm ssr mining reports consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2018 paul benson president and ceo said ssr mining had another successful year in 2018 as we continued our track record of achieving production and cost guidance for the seventh consecutive year while transitioning to commercial production at chinchillas we maintained a strong balance sheet after a year of investment that brought a new mine into production delivered reserve growth and included our strategic investment in silvercrest metals looking ahead 2019 consolidated gold production is forecast to grow to nearly 400 000 gold equivalent ounces as all three operations increase output including our newest mine chinchillas which is ramping up to steady state operations and by 2021 our production profile is expected to grow to 440 000 gold equivalent ounces not including the potential upside at marigold or success from our brownfield exploration programs with nearly 420 million of cash and an outlook of increasing production and higher margins we are well positioned to continue our track record of creating value for shareholders fourth quarter and year end 2018 highlights all figures are in u s dollars unless otherwise noted achieved annual production and cost guidance achieved initial guidance for the seventh consecutive year by delivering gold equivalent production of over 345 000 ounces at cash costs of 736 per payable gold equivalent ounce sold continued our track record of mineral reserves growth successful exploration activities in 2018 increased gold mineral reserves at the marigold mine to 3 3 million ounces and at the seabee gold operation to 608 000 ounces delivered record annual gold production at seabee the operation achieved its fifth consecutive annual production record producing 95 602 ounces of gold exceeding the top end of our upwardly revised annual guidance

the marigold mine produced 205 161 ounces of gold surpassing the upper end of our revised production guidance this compares to 202 240 ounces of gold produced in 2017 for the full year gold sales were 198 884 ounces due to bullion inventory increasing in the fourth quarter relative to the previous quarter which we expect to sell in the first quarter of 2019 material mined during the year totaled 70 4 million tonnes a 2 increase as compared to 2017 the mine achieved record annual ore tonnes delivered to the leach pads with over 27 5 million tonnes stacked during the fourth quarter of 2018 17 0 million tonnes of material were mined down 20 from the third quarter due to scheduled maintenance on the electric rope shovel and longer haul cycles construction delays deferred the new leach pad commissioning to the first quarter of 2019 and solution application commenced in january 2019 approximately 5 7 million tonnes of ore were delivered to the heap leach pads at a gold grade of 0 34 g t during the fourth quarter this compares to 6 9 million tonnes of ore delivered to the heap leach pads at a gold grade of 0 32 g t in the third quarter gold grade mined in the fourth quarter was 6 higher than the third quarter due to mining deeper in the current phase of the mackay pit the strip ratio declined to 2 0 1 in the quarter a 5 reduction compared to the previous quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018 the marigold mine produced 54 306 ounces of gold representing a 7 reduction as compared to the previous quarter mine operating costs cash costs and aisc per payable ounce of gold sold are non gaap financial measures please see cautionary note regarding non gaap measures cash costs which include all costs of inventory refining costs and royalties of 760 per payable ounce of gold sold in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 7 higher than the previous quarter primarily due to planned lower grades mined in the second half of the year total mining costs of 1 86 per tonne in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 23 higher than in the previous quarter due to fewer tonnes mined processing and general and administrative unit costs were higher in the fourth quarter of 2018 than in the third quarter of 2018 due to lower tonnes mined and processed processing and general and administrative costs in the current quarter were comparable on an absolute basis to the preceding quarter while mining costs declined cash costs per payable ounce of gold sold in 2018 were 723 higher than the 647 per payable ounce of gold sold in 2017 mainly due to higher leach pad opening inventory unit costs in 2018 relative to 2017 aisc in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 995 per payable ounce of gold sold compared to 965 in the third quarter due to increased capital spending mostly related to mobile equipment and construction of a new leach pad aisc of 974 per payable ounce of gold sold in 2018 increased from 896 in 2017 primarily due to higher capital investments and exploration partially offset by lower capitalized stripping mine sales a total of 50 550 ounces of gold were sold at an average realized price of 1 227 per ounce during the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease of 15 from the 59 612 ounces of gold sold at an average realized price of 1 207 per ounce during the third quarter of 2018 in 2018 gold sales decreased marginally and totaled 198 884 ounces compared to 200 192 ounces in 2017 exploration exploration at marigold in 2018 successfully replaced mine depletion with growth in mineral reserves compared to the end of 2017 mineral reserves increased to 3 30 million gold ounces 201 5 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 47 g t while measured and indicated mineral resources inclusive of mineral reserves totaled 5 56 million gold ounces 354 5 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 47 g t drilling activities during the fourth quarter of 2018 targeted infill drilling and upgrade of mineral resources at red dot and growth at various phases of the mackay pit with work also targeting resource addition this is consistent with our longer term objective of completing the necessary infill and geotechnical drilling to complete pit designs and an economic evaluation over the entire red dot area by mid year 2019 during the quarter we completed 21 260 meters of drilling in 60 reverse circulation rc holes at the mackay pit and within the red dot area rc drilling for the year totaled 93 276 meters in 259 rc holes following our exploration news release of november 6 2018 we have received results from an additional 33 rc drill holes that targeted

an annual production record resulting from an improved milling rate and higher gold grade in 2018 the operation milled 351 999 tonnes of ore 7 higher than 2017 and another operating record largely due to our ongoing operational excellence initiatives during the year average gold mill feed grade was 9 16 g t 11 higher compared to the average gold grade milled in 2017 the santoy mine supplied 93 of ore milled predominantly from long hole stopes the remaining ore was sourced from the seabee mine which was closed in the second quarter of 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the operation produced 20 473 ounces of gold a 26 decrease primarily due to gold ounces contained in circuit at year end 2018 due to timing of gold pours during the fourth quarter 86 447 tonnes of ore were milled at an average gold grade of 10 20 g t and recovery of 97 6 this compares to 88 273 tonnes of ore milled at an average gold grade of 9 52 g t and recovery of 97 1 in the third quarter of 2018 mine operating costs

regarding leach cycles construction of a leach pad is expected to be accelerated to the second half of 2019 from 2020 capitalized stripping is expected to total 20 million with the majority incurred through the first three quarters of the year exploration expenditures totaling 7 5 million re focuses to mackay valmy and basalt with the goals of adding mineral reserves and defining additional mineral resources within these areas having completed the red dot exploration program in 2018 we intend to complete geotechnical drilling and engineering of the remaining red dot mineral resources with the objective of evaluating the potential for additional red dot mineral reserves by mid 2019 at the seabee gold operation we expect to continue executing our plan of increasing mining and milling rates and to deliver another record gold production year in 2019 the plan includes investment of 7 million in underground mining equipment to increase capacity and reliability with higher tonnes mined and demonstrated milling infrastructure capacity cash costs are expected to remain low at between 525 and 555 per payable gold ounce sold due to continued exploration success at seabee we are embarking on an expansion to tailings capacity in excess of that contemplated in the 2017 technical report the first phase is expected to be completed in 2019 at an investment of 15 million with

puna operations with commercial production of the chinchillas open pit achieved 2019 marks the first anticipated full year of ore production from the chinchillas mine transported for processing at the pirquitas mill puna is expected to produce between 6 0 and 7 0 million ounces of silver at cash costs of between 8 00 and 10 00 per payable silver ounce sold reported cash costs may vary quarter to quarter due to the by product credits arising from the production of lead and zinc as such credits vary based on the timing of sales of each concentrate capital investments at puna of 12 million include 5 million for mine equipment maintenance and 5 million for plant equipment maintenance capitalized stripping is elevated through 2019 as the mine completes the highwall pushback and commences stripping the next phase of the chinchillas pit as chinchillas operations ramp up through 2019 only waste material will be mined over certain periods of the year with ore stockpiled during the pre production phase transported to and processed at the pirquitas mill with puna focused on optimization of the mine transport and mill operations through 2019 limited exploration expenditures of 1

please see cautionary note regarding non gaap measures quarterly financial summary revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased by 4 relative to the comparative quarter in 2017 due principally to lower gold and silver prices gold production was similar to the comparative quarter but gold sales were approximately 3 000 ounces lower due to timing of shipments silver production was also similar to the comparative quarter as commercial production was reached at the chinchillas mine on december 1 2018 providing a strong finish to the quarter as the pirquitas plant transitioned to solely chinchillas ore silver sales increased marginally relative to the comparative quarter but the increase did not offset the factors discussed above sales of lead and zinc commenced in the quarter with the resumption of base metal production from pirquitas and chinchillas ores but sales were well below production due to timeframes required to ramp up international concentrate sales income from mine operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 generated a gross margin of 16 lower than the 20 gross margin generated in the fourth quarter of 2017 mainly due to lower realized metal prices impacting margins at the marigold mine and puna operations relative to the comparative prior year quarter the seabee gold operation generated higher income from mine operations as lower cost and depreciation more than offset lower realized prices in the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred a net loss of 2 5 million compared to net income of 16 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 in addition to the lower metal prices and finished goods inventory build of gold and concentrates discussed above we recognized a share based compensation and payroll expense of 8 3 million principally resulting from stronger relative and absolute share price performance over the quarter we also recognized an expense of 2 8 million related to the premium paid over the prevailing market price for purchase of the shares of silvercrest metals inc silvercrest the subsequent increase in value of silvercrest shares of 4 3 million was recognized in other comprehensive income during the quarter a foreign exchange loss was recognized as the argentine peso stabilized and strengthened relative to the end of the third quarter net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 benefited from a tax recovery of 5 million cash used in operating activities was 3 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 45 2 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2017 lower metal prices combined with lower gold sales at higher unit costs more than offset higher silver sales at lower unit costs at puna operations operating activities were impacted by a 22 3 million increase in non cash working capital due to a combination of increased gold and concentrate finished goods inventories inventory in circuit at seabee gold operation chinchillas ore stockpiles at puna operations and a reduction in trade payables at year end particularly related to the chinchillas project we used 63 0 million in investing activities in the fourth quarter of 2018 we invested 23 1 million in the silvercrest share purchase 10 6 million in property plant and equipment and 18 9 million in the chinchillas project and loaned 8 million to our joint venture partner this compared to 9 6 million of cash used for investing activities in the fourth quarter of 2017 as the quarter benefited from 63 4 million of pretium share sale proceeds we received 8 8 million from our joint venture partner for its share of the development costs of the chinchillas project annual financial summary the 6 decrease in revenue for the year of 2018 compared to the year of 2017 was due to an 8 decrease in equivalent payable gold ounces sold somewhat offset by a higher average realized gold price the decrease was more than offset by lower silver ounces sold from puna operations as lower grade ore stockpiles were processed through the development of the chinchillas project income from mine operations in 2018 generated a gross margin of 18 lower than the 25 in 2017 higher sales of gold at lower cost of sales at the seabee gold operation was more than offset by lower sales of silver at puna operations and higher cost of sales at the marigold mine in the year ended december 31 2017 the release of a supplies inventory provision at puna operations and the resolution of our export duty claim in argentina resulted in a 10 5 million reduction to cost of sales increasing the 2017 reported gross margin our strong relative and absolute share price performance resulted in a 9 1 million higher share based payment expense in 2018 relative to 2017 being recognized through general and administrative expense we incurred a 2 8 million expense related to the premium paid over the prevailing market price on recording the investment in silvercrest shares the subsequent increase in value of silvercrest shares of 4 3 million was recognized in other comprehensive income we reported an elevated effective tax rate due to a 4 7 million tax expense related to the argentine re organization recorded in the second quarter of 2018 as a result a small net loss was reported in 2018 net income for 2017 benefitted by an impairment reversal of the pirquitas plant of 24 4 million resulting from its life extension following the formation of puna operations cash generated from operating activities was 59 8 million in 2018 compared to 144 7 million in 2017 higher sales and lower unit costs at the seabee gold operation were more than offset by lower sales combined with higher unit costs both at puna operations and the marigold mine non cash working capital of 36 million was incurred as finished goods and ore inventories were built across all operations and particularly related to the development and ramp up at chinchillas we used 115 9 million in investing activities in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 15 5 million used in the comparative period of 2017 in 2018 we received 63 4 million from the sales of our remaining common shares of pretium resources inc pretium while investments in our business included 67 7 million in property plant and equipment 60 2 million in the chinchillas project 23 1 million in silvercrest share purchase and loaned 8 0 million to our joint venture partner we received 15 2 million from our joint venture

support of the updated life of mine plan which is available on sedar at www sedar com the edgar section of the sec website at www sec gov and on our website as of june 30 2018 we sold our remaining position of 9 0 million pretium common shares for pre tax cash proceeds of approximately 63 4 million and no longer hold any pretium shares on december 1 2018 we declared commercial production at puna operations chinchillas mine development of the mine located approximately 45 kilometers from the pirquitas plant commenced in early 2018 and extends the life of the pirquitas plant through mining of ore at chinchillas transporting the ore to pirquitas and processing it through the existing pirquitas plant on december 10 2018 we completed a transaction with silvercrest which owns the las chispas project a high grade development project in mexico to purchase by way of private placement a 9 7 ownership interest representing 8 220 645 common shares of silvercrest at a price of c 3 73 per common share for total consideration of c 30 7 million in 2018 we achieved our initial guidance for the seventh consecutive year by delivering gold equivalent production of over 345 000 ounces at cash costs of 736 and aisc of 1 087 per payable gold equivalent ounce sold successful exploration activities in 2018 increased gold mineral reserves at the marigold mine by 110 000 ounces to 3 3 million ounces and at the seabee gold operation by 39 to 608 000 ounces mineral reserves and mineral resources at december 31 2018 our total estimated proven and probable gold mineral reserves were 3 91 million ounces and total estimated silver proven and probable mineral reserves were 38 7 million ounces mineral reserves estimates for the marigold mine the seabee gold operation and puna operations have been determined based on prices of 1 250 per ounce of gold and 18 00 per ounce of silver these prices are unchanged from those used to determine the mineral reserves estimate at december 31 2017 reflecting market conditions and consensus long term metal prices all mineral resources and mineral reserves estimates are reported on a 100 basis except for puna operations mineral resources and mineral reserves estimates of silver ounces for puna operations are reported on a 75 attributable basis at marigold our 2018 exploration program led to an increase in mineral reserves probable mineral reserves increased to 3 3 million ounces of gold 201 5 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 47 g t after accounting for mining depletion and minor modeling reductions while gold grade increased to 0 47 g t the increase in probable mineral reserves is attributable to our successful infill and exploration drilling programs which converted mineral resources at a portion of red dot and mackay collectively adding 460 000 gold ounces to mineral reserves we added 350 000 ounces of gold mineral reserves at red dot which we refer to as red dot phase 1 depletion of mineral reserves due to 2018 gold production totaled 320 000 ounces indicated mineral resources inclusive of mineral reserves totaled 5 56 million ounces of gold 354 5 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 47 g t after accounting for mining depletion and mine plan optimization offset by our successful exploration program inferred mineral resources declined to 400 000 ounces of gold 33 6 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 0 37 g t due to conversion of mineral reserves and mineral resources in certain areas particularly red dot in addition for further information regarding our mineral reserves and mineral resources estimate at marigold please see the marigold technical report at the seabee gold operation proven and probable mineral reserves total 608 000 ounces of gold proven mineral reserves were 94 500 ounces 0 33 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 9 00 g t and probable mineral reserves were 513 500 ounces 1 73 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 9 24 g t a 39 increase compared to year end 2017 as a result of conversion at santoy 8 proven and probable mineral reserves increases are due to conversion of 191 000 gold ounces at santoy 8 and 92 000 gold ounces at santoy gap measured and indicated mineral resources inclusive of mineral reserves total 856 000 gold ounces measured mineral resources were 170 000 ounces 0 45 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 11

with reporting standards in canada and the mineral reserves and the mineral resources estimates are made in accordance with ni 43 101 ni 43 101 is a rule developed by the canadian securities administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects these standards differ significantly from the requirements of the sec set out in sec industry guide 7 consequently mineral reserves and mineral resources information included in this news release is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by domestic u s reporting companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the sec under sec standards mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made in addition the sec s disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute reserves by u s standards in documents filed with the sec u s investors should understand that inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility moreover the requirements of ni 43 101 for identification of reserves are also not the same as those of the sec and reserves reported by us in compliance with ni 43 101 may not qualify as reserves under sec standards accordingly information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with u s standards cautionary note regarding non gaap measures this news release includes certain terms or performance measures commonly used in the mining industry that are not defined under international financial reporting standards ifrs including cash costs and aisc per payable ounce of precious metals sold realized metal prices adjusted attributable income loss before tax adjusted attributable net income loss adjusted basic attributable income loss per share operating income and working capital non gaap financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies we believe that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance the data presented is intended to provide additional information and should

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

updated brexit agreement or on the other way ahead leadsom said if the government has not secured a majority in this house in favor of a withdrawal agreement and a political declaration the government

any amendments to it on that day chancellor of exchequer philip hammond said regarding next week there may be an opportunity to bring a vote back to the house of commons there may be an opportunity but that will depend on the progress that is made in the next few days he added that prime minister theresa may s meeting with european commission president jean claude juncker went well and both sides have acknowledged that the political declaration could be expanded for example to address concerns that have been expressed in some parts of the house of commons about workers rights separately it s believed that may and juncker are working on a statement called appropriate legal assurance to both sides brexit minister steve barclay and attorney general geoffrey cox will visit brussels again today ecb risk largely external but there were pass through and spillovers in the accounts of january monetary policy meeting ecb noted that a stronger case could now be made for assessing the risks as having moved to the downside in large measure downside risks could be attributed to external environments including heightened protectionism and brexit but there were pass through and spillovers to domestic demand ecb also acknowledged that slowdown in euro area growth appeared to be deeper and more broad based than previously anticipated and negative developments had become more widespread across the euro area and risked affecting several components of demand the slowdown has previously be related primarily to trade but private consumption growth was weaker in q3 and employment growth decelerated ecb noted that if exports and consumption were both weaker this was likely to be transmitted to investment in the period ahead all in all members concurred with the view that the risks to the euro area outlook had moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and

clear through customers that s part of the measures to cap overall coal imports through the above harbours to 12m tonnes this year coal imports from russia and indonesia will not be affected it s also reported that clearing times for australian coal at other ports are prolonged to at least 40 days china s foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said the goals of the ban were to better safeguard the legal rights and interests of chinese importers and to protect the environment australia s minister for trade simon birmingham said i m aware of unconfirmed and unsourced media reports and have asked

manufacturing sector reflects stronger falls in production and new orders also future output expectations turn negative for the first time since november 2012 joe hayes economist at ihs markit said the data reflected sharper reductions in demand and production and underlying business conditions are unfavourable and this was further highlighted by output expectations turning negative for the first time in over six years which comes as no surprise given the international headwinds japanese manufacturers are facing such as a china slowdown and the global trade cycle losing further steam he added that unless service sector activity can offset manufacturing weakness the chance of japan entering a recession in 2019 looks set to rise also from japan all industry activity index dropped 0 4

account of the monetary policy meeting of the governing council of the european central bank held in frankfurt am main on wednesday and thursday 23 24 january 2019 1 review of financial economic and monetary developments and policy options financial market developments mr cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments in the first few weeks of 2019 volatility had remained elevated across different market segments in particular in equity and commodity markets brent oil prices had declined further after the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting on 12 13 december 2018 but had since recovered the volatility in oil prices was evidence of the heightened geopolitical uncertainty and its impact on oil supply as well as concerns about the global growth outlook and its impact on oil demand volatility had also increased recently in some foreign exchange markets in particular following the rejection by the british parliament of the eu withdrawal agreement the pound sterling had appreciated markedly against both the euro and the us dollar by contrast volatility in emerging market currencies had come down from the elevated levels observed in 2018 as regards global bond market developments yields had fallen measurably since the beginning of october 2018 the yields on ten year us treasuries had fallen from around 3 2 to 2 75 while ten year german government bond yields had fallen from around 0 60 to around 0 25 the spread between the two had thus narrowed returning to the levels that had been observed over most of the summer of 2018 a decomposition of euro area and us ten year overnight index swap rates into the inflation and the real components suggested that two countervailing factors had been driving yields over this period on both sides of the atlantic first the rise in real yields that had emerged in late summer had persisted and likely reflected a rise in the real term premium second there had been a fall in the inflation component which had offset the impact from the rise in real yields a comparison between survey and market based expectations for long term inflation suggested that the fall in the inflation component may have predominantly reflected a fall in the inflation risk premium it would hence be premature to conclude that market participants had materially reappraised their medium term inflation expectations spreads of higher yielding euro area sovereign bonds versus german bonds had broadly stabilised in recent weeks ten year sovereign bond spreads for italy spain and portugal against germany had either been stable or had fallen since early october 2018 for the euro area the forward money market curve was notably flatter than in october 2018 suggesting that expectations of a first ecb deposit facility rate increase had shifted from september 2019 to april 2020 revisions to survey expectations had been more moderate and saw this occurring in the fourth quarter of 2019 looking at equities overall valuation losses in the euro area were of the same order as in the united states amounting to some 8 9 since early october 2018 a model based analysis showed that euro area equity price movements had also reflected lower earnings expectations whereas in the united states they had by and large been due to an increase in the equity risk premium global corporate bond markets had experienced some broad based repricing spreads of us high yield bonds had increased by around 120 basis points since early october 2018 in the euro area the repricing had been less pronounced but spreads of high yield bonds had nevertheless risen by around 90 basis points spreads of euro area investment grade corporate bonds had also increased measurably over this period finally turning to year end developments in the euro area repo market more orderly conditions had been observed than in previous years the smooth year end had likely reflected better preparations by market participants the global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area mr praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area regarding the external environment the global growth and trade momentum was slowing further in particular the global composite output purchasing managers index pmi had decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the third quarter on the back of a weaker manufacturing sector component while the services sector component had remained broadly unchanged trade indicators had also weakened towards the end of 2018 possibly reflecting growth headwinds as well as elevated policy uncertainty regarding us china trade relations annual consumer price inflation in the oecd area had slowed to 2 7 in november largely driven by lower energy price inflation inflation excluding food and energy had decreased marginally to 2 2 at the same time wage dynamics had showed some stabilisation with compensation per employee growing at a rate close to 3 in the first three quarters of 2018 brent crude oil prices had increased by around 3 since the december monetary policy meeting over the same period food prices had increased by 4 while metal prices had declined by 2 the euro exchange rate had remained broadly stable both in nominal effective terms and in bilateral terms against the us dollar turning to the euro area incoming data had generally surprised on the downside and the near term growth momentum would likely be weaker than previously anticipated the headline manufacturing pmi for the euro area for december had stood at 51 1 down from 52 7 in november the latest pmi survey data had pointed to a further slowing of the growth momentum in particular in more cyclically sensitive industries such as capital and intermediate goods at the same time domestic demand was being supported by favourable financing conditions and labour market dynamics rising wages and lower energy prices in particular private consumption could be expected to remain resilient employment had increased by 0 2 quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2018 down from 0 4 in the previous two quarters the unemployment rate had fallen further in november to 7 9 thereby reaching its lowest level since october 2008 survey indicators had signalled weaker but still positive employment growth in the coming quarters in particular the pmi employment indicator had weakened notably since the summer but remained in expansionary territory standing at 53 4 in december extra euro area exports were expected to remain subdued on account of weakening foreign demand growth growth in euro area goods exports had declined in the third quarter of 2018 by 0 4 in quarter on quarter terms the decline in the third quarter could be attributed to a drop in capital goods exports and in particular in motor vehicles the latest trade data for october and november together with the latest survey indicators with leading properties consistently pointed to a further deterioration in the euro area trade outlook in the fourth quarter of 2018 turning to price developments according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation had stood at 1 6 in december down from 1 9 in november while hicp inflation excluding food and energy had remained unchanged at 1 0 the decrease in hicp inflation had mainly reflected lower energy price inflation overall the december data had turned out weaker than expected driven by energy and services price inflation meanwhile measures of underlying inflation had continued to move sideways domestic cost pressures had increased but had yet to translate into consumer price inflation along the supply chain import and producer price inflation for both goods and services were rising the upward cost pressure stemming from labour costs had intensified in the third quarter of 2018 with unit labour cost growth increasing to 2 2 from 1 6 in the second quarter the results from the ecb survey of professional forecasters for the first quarter of 2019 had pointed to average inflation expectations of 1 5 for 2019 1 6 for 2020 and 1 7 for 2021 compared with the previous survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 this represented downward revisions of 0 2 percentage point for 2019 and 0 1 percentage point for 2020 this implied a weaker profile than in the december 2018 eurosystem staff projections which could largely be accounted for by different oil price assumptions market based inflation expectations had also been revised down somewhat with the five year forward break even inflation rate five years ahead standing at 1 54 financial conditions had tightened somewhat in recent months in the context of heightened market volatility while being broadly unchanged compared with the december meeting overall credit conditions remained favourable compared with the situation at the time of the december meeting euro area non financial equities had rebounded somewhat although earnings expectations had been revised down the expected timing of a first ecb policy rate increase had shifted out further turning to money and credit developments broad money m3 growth had moderated slightly further to 3 7 in november money creation was increasingly driven by credit to the private sector the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector had stabilised in recent months standing at 3 3 in november 2018 after strengthening since early 2014 at the same time euro area banks composite funding costs had been increasing somewhat in recent months mainly owing to increases in bank bond yields and bank equity prices had declined meanwhile bank lending rates remained favourable standing only marginally above their historical lows as regards fiscal policy the euro area fiscal stance as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance was expected to be mildly expansionary in 2019 and 2020 monetary policy considerations and policy options summing up mr praet remarked that financial conditions had tightened somewhat in recent months in a context of heightened market volatility but remained supportive the ecb s monetary policy had contributed to dampening the impact of prevailing uncertainties on financial conditions credit conditions for households and firms remained accommodative incoming data on growth had continued to be weaker than expected on account of softer external demand and country and sector specific factors with the near term growth momentum likely to be weaker than previously anticipated the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had moved to the downside as the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility was increasingly weighing on economic sentiment hicp inflation had fallen in december reflecting mainly lower energy price inflation and was likely to decline further over the coming months measures of underlying inflation remained muted but labour cost pressures were continuing to strengthen and were expected to pass through to underlying inflation in the period ahead while the ongoing economic expansion continued to support confidence in the convergence of inflation to the ecb s inflation aim recent developments called for thorough analysis as regards their implications for the medium term outlook against this background mr praet proposed at this stage to confirm the governing council s enhanced forward guidance which especially under the current circumstances had contributed to more supportive market interest rates external communication should a stress that incoming information had continued to be weaker than expected signalling a slower near term growth momentum b acknowledge that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility c underline that the ongoing euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures continued to support confidence in the sustained convergence of inflation to the governing council s aim d emphasise that significant monetary policy stimulus remained essential to support the further build up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term and that this stimulus would be provided by the governing council s forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets e reiterate that in any event the governing council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continued to move towards its aim in a sustained manner 2 governing council s discussion and monetary policy decisions economic and monetary analyses with regard to the economic analysis members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by mr praet in his introduction and they discussed the balance of risks recent data and survey results had continued to be weaker than expected on account of softer external demand and some country and sector specific factors affecting domestic activity while the impact of some of these factors was expected to fade incoming data suggested that the near term growth momentum was likely to be weaker than previously anticipated however no clear cut conclusions could be drawn regarding the implications of slower growth in the short term for the outlook for activity in the medium term in the light of significant uncertainty about whether the country and sector specific factors would be transitory or longer lasting in this context it was underlined that the outlook for activity would be reassessed in more depth by the governing council at its meeting in early march when the new ecb staff projections would be available in considering the outlook and risks for the external environment members noted that global growth and trade momentum had slowed further in particular there were concerns among members about an increasing impact of trade protectionism and an escalation of trade conflicts on the global outlook over time it was noted that chinese imports at the end of 2018 had been much lower than expected which likely reflected the negative impact of trade tensions between the united states and china in addition acute risks remained surrounding the united kingdom s withdrawal from the eu it was widely agreed that uncertainties and risks related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility had remained prominent and appeared to be exacting an increasing toll on the world economy against this background the downside risks to global activity and trade were seen as having increased turning to euro area activity members observed that the recent data had been weaker than expected real gdp growth had slowed from 0 4 to 0 2 quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2018 some other hard data had also disappointed and more recent indicators based on the latest european commission business surveys and purchasing managers surveys had declined further altogether the evidence pointed to the likelihood of growth being at or even below potential for several quarters it also had to be acknowledged that the carry over effect from slower growth in the second half of 2018 would in itself entail a lower projection for growth in 2019 however it was emphasised that growth remained positive and that the probability of a recession remained low nonetheless the perception was widely shared that there was elevated uncertainty at present regarding how persistent the current soft patch would be at the same time it was emphasised that the euro area economic expansion continued to be supported by fundamental factors and in particular by favourable financing conditions further employment gains and rising wages lower energy prices and the ongoing albeit somewhat slower expansion in global activity in their exchange of views about the interpretation of incoming data members shared information on recent developments in their respective national economies and sought to provide an assessment of the likely persistence of the factors behind the recent weakening in activity the impact of new emissions testing standards on car production and registrations was again mentioned as a dampening factor in the largest euro area economy however new car registrations were rising again the slump had lasted longer than initially expected and while there were signs that it might now be ending there was uncertainty about how quickly activity in this sector would recover it was also pointed out that even in the absence of shocks growth in the euro area would have been expected to slow given the maturity of the business cycle from rates above potential towards rates closer to potential members discussed in greater detail the risks to the euro area growth outlook it was widely felt that it was not yet possible to judge with any confidence how persistent the present soft patch would be and to what extent slower growth in the short term could affect the medium term growth outlook as some factors were temporary or sector or country specific however members concurred with the assessment provided by mr praet that a stronger case could now be made for assessing the risks as having moved to the downside in large measure downside risks could be attributed to risks in the external environment such as those related to heightened protectionism and the united kingdom s withdrawal from the eu which were increasingly weighing on sentiment in the euro area the cumulative impact from the persistence of a wide range of risks both external and domestic was emphasised with soft data in the euro area having declined more than hard data concern was expressed that the persistence of the prevailing high level of uncertainty was affecting confidence as reflected in further falls in business surveys which in turn could adversely affect domestic demand arguments were put forward that an assessment of risks to growth as still being broadly balanced could be supported by lower oil prices and the stimulus from fiscal measures moreover the negative impact of a shock to global growth could also be partially offset by policy responses in various jurisdictions at the same time it was underlined that the observed slowdown in euro area growth appeared to be deeper and more broad based than previously anticipated affecting not only the car sector but also other manufacturing sectors negative developments had become more widespread across the euro area and risked affecting several components of demand although the slowdown appeared to be mainly due to external factors pass through and spillovers in the euro area explained why domestic demand had also slowed while the slowdown had previously been related primarily to trade private consumption growth had been weaker in the third quarter of 2018 and employment growth had decelerated it was suggested that if exports and consumption were both weaker this was likely to be transmitted to investment in the period ahead furthermore it was reiterated that past revisions to growth in the staff projections had essentially reflected the incorporation of new data regarding the short term leaving the growth path for the remainder of the projection horizon practically unchanged all in all members concurred with the view that the risks to the euro area outlook had moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction according to eurostat euro area annual hicp inflation had declined to 1 6 in december from 1 9 in november mainly reflecting a decline in energy price inflation on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation was likely to decrease further over the coming months measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted but domestic cost pressures were continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets looking ahead underlying inflation was expected to increase over the medium term supported by the ecb s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth as regards the possible implications of weaker growth for the medium term inflation outlook it was argued that more information was needed for a thorough assessment in this context it was noted that the labour market had so far continued to improve with labour shortages becoming more apparent in some member states although more broadly some deceleration in employment growth had been observed members considered that recent developments in wage growth continued to provide some reassurance regarding the outlook for underlying inflation compensation per employee in the euro area as a whole had risen by 2 5 in the third quarter of 2018 having increased steadily since 2016 while the pick up in wage growth had become broader based across countries and sectors it was also argued that the relatively high level of headline inflation in 2018 would continue to affect wage negotiations which often contained a backward looking component it was widely emphasised that the transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation was a key issue for the medium term outlook for inflation and an important source of uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook that was seen to require close monitoring it was noted that while the relationship between wages and unemployment appeared to be intact there had so far been little response in underlying inflation measures to improving labour market conditions this was illustrated by the fact that over the previous five years underlying inflation had been stable at around 1 while unemployment had fallen from around 12 to just below 8 underlying inflation had not risen even in the period when the economy was growing very quickly members also discussed the behaviour of profit margins and mark ups it was noted that higher wage growth had not been passed through to price inflation because firms had absorbed it by lowering profit margins and attention was drawn to the drop in gross operating surplus growth to practically zero in the third quarter of 2018 however it was argued that mark ups could not be squeezed indefinitely and that this effect would serve only to delay the pass through of higher wages to consumer prices more generally it was underlined that the transmission to consumer price inflation was subject to time lags and it appeared that more time and patience were needed however it was also argued that more structural or longer lasting factors might still be at play for example related to changes in the competitive environment and to pressures on margins from e commerce as regards recent developments in longer term inflation expectations members noted that both market based and survey based measures had fallen since the previous monetary policy meeting of the governing council expectations of inflation five years ahead in the survey of professional forecasters for the first quarter of 2019 had been revised down to 1 8 from 1 9 in the fourth quarter of 2018 market based inflation expectations as measured by the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1 54 slightly below the level prevailing at the time of the december 2018 governing council meeting and at their lowest level since june 2017 while the risk of deflation had been negligible for some time the short term outlook for inflation had weakened due to lower oil prices and weak developments in domestic services prices concern was expressed that there might be a risk that this renewed weakness could start to weigh on inflation expectations if it were to persist regarding fiscal policies the governing council reiterated the need to rebuild fiscal buffers this was particularly important in countries where government debt was high and for which full adherence to the stability and growth pact was critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions with regard to the monetary analysis members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction the annual growth rate of broad money m3 which had moderated somewhat in november 2018 continued to be underpinned by bank credit creation the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth reference was made to the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 which showed that overall bank lending conditions had remained favourable in the euro area following an extended period of net easing while demand for bank credit had continued to rise credit standards on loans to enterprises and households had tightened slightly mostly on account of developments in one large euro area economy that had been subject to financial market volatility and bank funding costs had also edged up looking ahead it was felt that some consideration should be given to the outlook for liquidity conditions in the banking sector as the redemptions of outstanding targeted longer term refinancing operations were approaching which might give rise to cliff effects monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction there was broad agreement that the stance remained highly expansionary overall and that it had contributed to dampening the impact of prevailing uncertainties on financial conditions which remained favourable it was remarked that alongside uncertainty about the external environment uncertainty regarding the euro area economy had risen recently pertaining to both the growth outlook and inflation owing to not only lower oil prices but also the slow pass through from wages to prices there was broad agreement among members that supportive financing conditions favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continued to underpin the euro area expansion thus supporting confidence in the convergence of inflation to the governing council s aim while measures of underlying inflation remained muted labour cost pressures were strengthening further and were expected to pass through to underlying inflation in the period ahead in this regard it was underlined that the euro area was still experiencing growth momentum with labour market conditions improving and lower oil prices supporting consumption looking ahead a key question was seen to be the extent to which the weaker growth momentum might turn out to be more persistent than currently envisaged more information including the march projections was needed to deepen the analysis and obtain greater clarity before conclusions could be drawn about the medium term inflation outlook against this background all members agreed with the monetary policy considerations put forward by mr praet in his introduction this entailed confirming the enhanced forward guidance on the path of the key ecb interest rates and on the reinvestments of acquired assets while acknowledging that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism significant monetary policy stimulus would continue to be provided by the forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and on the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets at the same time the governing council would reiterate that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the governing council s inflation aim in a sustained manner members underlined that specifying the forward guidance on the governing council s policy instruments in terms of both a time based leg and a state contingent leg had served it well the observation was made that in response to the recent weaker than expected data some easing in financial conditions had taken place through an outward shift in market expectations for the timing of a first rise in key ecb interest rates this endogenous response was viewed as being consistent with the state based elements of the governing council s forward guidance and contributed to preserving the financial conditions on which the projected inflation convergence remained contingent the chained forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and the reinvestments was seen as functioning as a kind of automatic stabiliser particularly in situations when further easing was deemed desirable in reaction to weaker than expected data there was wide agreement that the continued convergence of inflation to the governing council s aim in the period ahead still required an ample degree of monetary accommodation a number of remarks were made regarding available monetary policy tools in the domain of longer term liquidity provision any potential new operations should reflect the monetary policy objectives to be achieved while any decisions in this respect should not be taken too hastily the technical analyses required to prepare policy options for future liquidity operations needed to proceed swiftly on communication members widely concurred with the elements proposed by mr praet in his introduction accordingly it was seen as appropriate to acknowledge that the incoming data had continued to be weaker than expected but that supportive financing conditions favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continued to underpin the expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures in the euro area at the same time it had to be recognised that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility in this regard the need to communicate cautiously was stressed in order to strike the right balance between credibility in acknowledging the weaker than expected data and conveying confidence in the adjustment towards the governing council s medium term inflation aim consequently the governing council would reconfirm its forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and on the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme members agreed that monetary policy needed to remain prudent patient and persistent and to continue to follow a data driven approach in the period ahead at the current juncture a steady hand was seen as warranted and discussions with regard to monetary policy operations or the forward guidance were deemed premature at the same time the governing council needed to reiterate that it was prepared to act if needed monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0 00 0 25 and 0 40 respectively the governing council reiterated that it expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term with regard to non standard monetary policy measures the governing council intended to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the introductory statement which the president and the vice president would as usual deliver at the press conference following the end of the current governing council meeting introductory statement press release meeting of the ecb s governing council 23 24 january 2019 members

by kevin yao beijing reuters china s central bank is not yet ready to cut benchmark interest rates to spur the slowing economy despite cooling inflation and a stronger yuan which have fanned market expectations of such a move policy sources told reuters but the people s bank of china pboc is likely to cut market based rates and further lower banks reserve ratios rrr to boost credit growth and reduce firms borrowing costs according to the sources involved in internal policy discussions we cannot rule out a benchmark rate cut but we still need to watch economic data for a few months one said there is no sufficient reason for cutting benchmark rates if we look at the huge amount of new loans in january china s trading partners and major central banks are increasingly concerned over how quickly the world s second largest economy is decelerating and much it will drag on global growth premier li keqiang reiterated on wednesday that china will not resort to flood like stimulus like that unleashed in past downturns but after a spate of weak data investors are asking if beijing needs to speed up or intensify support to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown analysts polled by reuters expect china s official growth rate to cool to 6 3 percent in 2019 a 29 year low and some believe real activity levels are already much weaker than government data suggest but china watchers note the pboc has many policy tools to choose from before wielding blunter instruments such as a lending rate cut which would lower financing costs across the board but risk adding to a mountain of debt more rrr cuts have been expected in coming quarters after five in the past year most recently in january the pboc has also been guiding money market rates lower in various ways and offered a slightly better rate on a new medium term lending programme launched in january the pboc did not immediately respond to reuters request for comment waiting for signs of a turnaround in one sign that recent policy loosening measures may be starting to be felt china s mostly state backed banks doled out a record 3 23 trillion yuan 480 43 billion in loans in january following months of urging by the pboc to keep financing open to cash strapped companies but the pboc was quick to say after the data that it has not opened the credit floodgates analysts note there is a time lag before a jump in lending will translate into growth suggesting business conditions may get worse before they get better but the government is also planning to step up fiscal stimulus ranging from more infrastructure spending to sweeping tax cuts building on moves last year in the last downturn in 2014 2015 china cut the benchmark six times but it has kept the benchmark at 4 35 percent since october 2015 while the central bank focuses on building a more market based regime that will get funding to parts of the economy that need it most only a handful of analysts have predicted a benchmark cut this time around but speculation has been growing that the pboc may take other action soon as deflationary pressures build and the yuan strengthens threatening more pressure on exporters data last week showed january producer price inflation cooled for a seventh straight month the yuan has gained about 2 6 percent against the dollar this year buoyed by hopes for progress in sino u s trade talks after falling 5 3 percent in 2018 lost in transmission while the pboc has been pushing a lot of funds into the financial system the money has not been flowing smoothly to companies particularly private firms which account for over half of china s economy banks are wary of lending to smaller firms with higher credit risks preferring state backed customers while businesses are reluctant to take on debt when sales and profits are weakening bond defaults hit a record last year that has prompted the central bank to become more innovative in developing new policy tools to encourage growth most recently it allowed banks to issue perpetual bonds in a major step toward recapitalisation of the country s banks that could give them more room to lend pboc officials say policy steps are starting to show some results the average lending rate for small firms fell to 6 16 percent in january from 6 37 percent a year earlier but analysts caution it is too early to tell if many firms are refinancing existing debt or planning new investments dbs economists said recently that real interest rates the benchmark rate minus producer inflation have shot up to 4 3 percent societe generale expects pboc to cut the 7 day reverse repo rate by at least 20 basis points by end 2019 and could cut other market based rates while lowering rrr by 100 bps each quarter sources believe a benchmark cut may only happen if the economy slows abruptly and broad based deflation emerges but they expect stimulus measures will start to put a floor under economic growth around mid year a trade deal between china and the united states would also reduce the chance of a benchmark cut sources said negotiators are racing to meet a march 1 deadline and failure could lead to a sharp hike in u s tariffs on chinese goods a benchmark cut could also been seen as a setback in long promised reforms to allow market forces to determine the cost of capital in china which is key to producing more sustainable and higher quality growth and reducing inefficient investment there are many tools in the central bank s toolkit and financing costs could fall as liquidity is ample and policy transmission mechanism improves said one of the

largely driven by the full year contribution from assets included in the acquisition of veresen inc veresen in october 2017 veresen acquisition and assets placed into service following a large scale capital program driving growing revenue volumes highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 include operational highlights executive overview 2018 was truly remarkable for pembina we strengthened our financial and operational performance driven by our diverse and strategically located assets strong customer contracts and the dedication and creativity of our customers and employees over this past year we continued to secure new business pursued growth projects operated safely and reliably and further enhanced our already strong relationships with the communities where we live work and play in 2018 we announced the next evolution in pembina s corporate strategy the move towards accessing global markets pembina is committed to identifying additional opportunities to connect hydrocarbon production to new demand locations through the development of infrastructure that would extend our service offering further along the hydrocarbon value chain these new developments will contribute to ensuring that hydrocarbons produced in the western canadian sedimentary basin and the other basins where pembina operates can reach the highest value markets throughout the world our recently approved pdh pp facility the prince rupert lpg export terminal currently under construction and our proposed jordan cove lng project are examples of such developments the most notable financial achievement over the past year was exceeding the high end of our original 2018 guidance range with adjusted ebitda of 2 835 million seven percent higher than the mid point of the original range contributing to this record breaking adjusted ebitda was the full year contribution from the greater than 10 billion increase in assets from the veresen acquisition and new assets placed into service following the execution of our large scale capital program completed in 2017 the veresen acquisition was transformational for pembina and we are pleased with how well the integration of staff and systems went bringing together two large and different organizations comes with a wide range of risks and yet through the diligent management of our integration team we are realizing the strategic and financial benefits of the combination along with record adjusted ebitda our 2018 adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share of 4 27 also was an all time high notably when comparing where we are now to where we were ten years ago we have grown volumes by 180 percent cash flow per share by 171 percent and the dividend by 50 percent over the same 10 year period shareholders have realized a total return of about 380 percent or 17 percent per year assuming reinvestment of their dividends our steady and growing dividend is one of the strongest ways we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to shareholders we have always worked hard to ensure our ability to pay a competitive dividend and the 5 6 percent dividend increase in 2018 represents our seventh consecutive annual increase since our inception pembina has returned over 6 9 billion to our shareholders and the dividend has never been reduced ensuring pembina continues to deliver a sustainable and growing dividend to shareholders remains a top priority continuing our dividend track record while growing the business requires a strong commitment to prudent financial management something that has always been fundamental to pembina as the company has grown we have also improved the risk profile of the business and strengthened our financial guardrails we have increased the percentage of our adjusted ebitda that comes from fee based business and our dividend is fully supported by these fee based cash flows meaning pembina is not reliant on the commodity exposed part of our business to fund the dividend in addition pembina has a very strong balance sheet low payout ratio and expects to fund our near term capital program without the need for external equity in 2018 we placed approximately 900 million of projects into service including the phase iv and v expansions of the peace pipeline system veresen midstream s north central liquids hub and saturn ii gas plant cavern developments as well as several other value added capital projects we also secured over 1 8 billion of new capital projects including the phase vi and vii peace pipeline expansions hythe developments and duvernay iii consistent with pembina s guardrails these projects are underpinned by long term fee based contracts that will generate incremental secure and predictable cash flow to support the stability and growth of the dividend with new projects placed into service in 2018 we announced an adjusted ebitda guidance range of 2 8 to 3 0 billion and a 1 6 billion capital program for 2019 we are entering the new year with positive momentum and already in 2019 pembina has secured the 500 million phase viii peace pipeline expansion and through our joint venture canada kuwait petrochemical corporation approved development of a 4 5 billion 2 5 billion net to pembina integrated pdh pp facility the prospects for future growth both within the base business and further extensions of our value chain remain robust we are as rich in growth opportunities as we have ever been which is a testament to both the resiliency and creativity of our customers and the underlying attractiveness of

the minutes of the federal reserve s latest monetary policy meeting didn t contain the sort of specifics needed to get financial markets really enthusiastic there was some nice discussion about balance sheet reduction and why this really shouldn t be a very big deal for financial markets there were hints that the balance sheet reduction would end this year although the balance sheet would then still shrink as a share of gdp at that point of perhaps some interest was the fact that there were clear disagreements between different factions at the fomc about the nature and the timing of further monetary policy timing the rather astonishing unanimity of view we have seen earlier in the year has now given way to the normal hawks versus doves discussions the fed did also highlight international economic concerns in europe and elsewhere as a reason for caution but these concerns should fade later this year an excerpt of the minutes that could also be of interest to investors reads risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated that said and all in all there was something for everyone and certainly nothing to go against the idea of a rate hike later this year regarding the u s china trade negotiations reuters reports that negotiators are drawing up six memorandums of understanding mous on structural issues forced technology transfer and cyber theft intellectual property rights services currency agriculture and non tariff barriers to trade as a broad outline of what could make up a deal nevertheless one source cautioned that the talks could still end in failure but the work on the mous was a significant step in getting china to sign up both to broad principles and to specific commitments on key issues the chinese commerce ministry spokesman gao feng declined to comment on the mous besides that geng shuang a spokesman of the chinese ministry of foreign affairs said at a routine press briefing that china will not use its currency the yuan s cny exchange rate as a bargaining chip to resolve trade disputes with the united states geng s comments follow reports that the u s is pressing china to keep the yuan cny stable as part of an agreement intended to end the u s china trade war the china daily ciaxin reported turning to the u s from the census bureau we got the advance report on new orders for u s manufactured durable goods that rose 1 2 percent from a month earlier in december 2018 following an upwardly revised 1 percent advance in november and missing market expectations of a 1 5 percent gain excluding transportation new orders increased 0 1 percent excluding defense new orders increased 1 8 percent transportation equipment was up 4 of the last 5 months led the increase it is a bit soon to be looking for firm signs of better investment ahead but if it does come through it could be magnified by the trade effect and create a double positive or at least a double force for stabilization in the global economy from the euro area we got the ihs markit flash eurozone pmi which informed that eurozone growth remained muted in february amid a decline in manufacturing chris williamson chief business economist at ihs markit commented the eurozone economy remained close to stagnation in february the survey data suggest that eurozone gdp may struggle to rise by much more than 0 1 percent in the first quarter germany is on course to grow by 0 2 percent while france looks set to stagnate or even contract very slightly the rest of the eurozone meanwhile is suffering its worst spell since late 2013 with growth having slipped closer to stalling in february price pressures have meanwhile continued to ease alongside the more subdued demand environment all this is important for investors as it more and more starts to look like the european central bank could ease gain in one way or another which would of course be a negative for the euro for now the euro remains around the 1 13 per euro handle etienne hans parisis is a bank economist who has advised investors on financial markets and international investments
last april shortly after new jersey governor phil murphy proposed a budget with hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes his texas counterpart greg abbott published an op ed in the garden state s largest newspaper inviting businesses and residents to consider moving south i d like to throw a lifeline to businesses and families throughout new jersey who are looking for greater economic opportunity and relief from high taxes come to texas and be a part of our economic success story wrote abbott combine our low taxes and reasonable regulatory environment with our access to global markets and our robust infrastructure and it s easy to see why the texas economy continues to flourish shortly afterward murphy responded in the dallas morning news explaining that his budget sought to move jersey in a stronger and fairer direction after years of putting the wealthy and big corporations ahead of ordinary people he didn t explain how his state with the nation s third highest corporate income tax and its worst business climate had put corporations ahead of ordinary people nor did murphy clarify how jersey where the top 1 percent of households pays 38 percent of the income taxes favored the wealthy instead the governor touted what he considered jersey s strengths among them lots of investment in things like education as a reason for firms and residents to stay put murphy s stance was typical of officials in high tax states who ve long argued that businesses and families care about more than just taxes they also want quality government service on this view and are willing to pay extra for it in late 2017 when the trump administration proposed nixing the federal exemption for state and local taxes defenders of the policy mostly from high tax democratic states said that ending it would hurt them by making local taxes more expensive to residents but this decades old argument about the payoff from high taxes is increasingly at odds with reality in polls asking whether residents and businesses want to leave a state the most discontented respondents come from heavily democratic and high tax states many who say that they plan to leave say that taxes are indeed a factor but lurking in the data are other reasons including mounting discontent with what residents actually get for their tax dollars independent studies show that on the core tasks that people think government should do building roads and bridges running airports and transit systems or otherwise spending tax dollars well high tax states rank low despite enormous financial resources states that tax a lot also tend to regulate heavily and that has emerged as another underlying cost that this high tax high spending model imposes on citizens and businesses of course not all democratic leaning states are high tax heavily regulated environments and not all republican leaning states deliver great services at low prices but republican or democratic low tax states are less likely to overcharge residents for government failure because they don t automatically view government as the answer to public problems in new jersey we are moving in a new direction murphy wrote in his dallas morning news piece an unfamiliar reader might assume that the state was catching up after years of low taxes and underinvestment but jersey has been one of the nation s most heavily taxed states for decades and its financial woes date back more than 20 years the question that murphy and other big government advocates ignore what happened to all the money illustrations by sean delonas every few years gallup asks americans whether they want to leave their state the results vary dramatically less than a quarter of people in montana oregon washington colorado south dakota texas and maine say that they want to leave but more than 40 percent in new jersey connecticut illinois rhode island and maryland are looking to move seven of the eight places that people are most eager to flee rank solidly democratic in party affiliation most like new jersey connecticut and new york are high tax environments by contrast the states with the smallest percentage of people wanting out include democratic leaning and republican leaning states but they re all low to middle tax states oregon and washington have among the lowest tax burdens of any democratic leaning states for instance summing up this pattern gallup observed even after controlling for various demographic characteristics including age gender race and ethnicity and education there is still a strong relationship between total state tax burden and desire to leave one s current state of residence these results have stayed consistent for years and migration data reflect them a study by demographer wendell cox of net flows of migrants from state to state found that seven of the ten states with the most net out migration are democratic california connecticut illinois maryland massachusetts new jersey and new york by contrast the states winning the most residents were either republican politically neutral or low tax democratic places including again washington and oregon still taxes aren t the only reason people give for leaving or hoping to leave when monmouth university s polling institute asked jersey residents 30 percent listed taxes as a reason the largest group but 24 percent said that the overall high cost of living soured them on the state and 28 percent listed reasons relating to quality of life from government corruption and traffic congestion to lack of opportunity a similar poll taken of the state s businesses in january of last year found that twice as many planned to expand elsewhere rather than keep growing in state while taxes were their biggest gripe business executives rated quality of life problems close behind with only 24 percent deeming new jersey a better place to live than other states what do residents generally want from local government and how do the states with heavy out migration perform in those areas in most polls infrastructure especially roads bridges and airports ranks high among the basic things that citizens and businesses expect government to provide given how much revenue high tax blue states rake in this should be an area where they vastly outperform their peers but the opposite is true in its annual rankings of the best and worst places to do business in america cnbc collects data on everything from roads and airports to water systems and ports and then grades states on their performance among the bottom ten that is the places with the worst rated infrastructure are six democratic states which also rank among the highest in taxes collected per resident connecticut hawaii maryland massachusetts new jersey and new york no democratic state makes the best infrastructure list even more startling several top rated states for infrastructure are among the lowest taxed governor abbott s jersey poaching texas boasts the top overall ranking no state ships more goods to more places than texas observes the study and texas on average does it better than other locales also scoring within the top ten tennessee which collects the second lowest state and local taxes per capita florida ranked fourth lowest in taxes and utah with the eighth lowest burden judging by the list an almost inverse relationship exists between the resources that state governments take in and how effectively they build and maintain infrastructure graphs by alberto mena within the broad category of infrastructure airports remain a vital regional amenity when they re thinking about location businesses consider the quality of an area s airport as key and local residents naturally prize it too but airports in blue state high tax regions tend to be loathed in recent j d power polls the lowest rated american airports among travelers were laguardia in new york city along with newark liberty philadelphia international fort lauderdale hollywood international chicago o hare new york jfk los angeles international honolulu inouye international and boston logan almost all serving blue states some blue state airports are so bad that they re rated worse than airports in developing countries former vice president joe biden infamously described laguardia as a third world airport to understand the degree of failure reflected in these rankings consider the three new york airports all managed by a nearly century old bistate agency the port authority of new york and new jersey the authority s operating philosophy illustrates the shortcomings of the high tax high fee heavily regulated blue state regime the agency s board members and top officers are appointed by the governors of the two states though it receives no tax revenues from the states its control of key regional infrastructure gives it enormous taxing power in the form of fees tolls fares and rents that it collects everywhere from bridge and tunnel crossings to the airports themselves the airports have proved especially lucrative generating some 600 million yearly in operating income which the authority uses to subsidize lavish salaries and benefits for workers and politically favored but super costly money losing building projects much of this has come at the expense of reinvestment in the airports newark liberty s biggest tenant united airlines sued the port authority claiming that its gate fees were unjustifiably the nation s highest and that among other things the money was paying for an airport police force that was by any reasonable standard extravagantly compensated a 2016 city journal analysis found that port authority police on average received 153 784 in salaries starting with a base pay of 90 000 for top officers with overtime adding tens of thousands more sergeants earned more than 182 000 that year making them among the highest paid cops in america and it wasn t just the police electricians working for the agency s rail lines took home an average of 111 000 annually and even toll collectors raked in more than 85 000 annually rich with fees the port authority also embarks regularly on pricey building projects which go wildly over budget it commissioned for instance a 2 billion station to replace the path terminal destroyed by the 9 11 bombings already obscenely expensive for what was basically a new subway station the project ultimately cost 4 billion to finish sucking money from the airports and miring the agency deep in debt a major driver of these costs is the alliance between left leaning politicians mostly but not exclusively democrats and public sector unions what walter russell mean defines as the blue state model under this alliance as state and local budgets have fattened public employees have captured a growing percentage of the rising revenues connecticut the state with the second most heavily unionized public workforce introduced an income tax in 1991 signed into law by an independent governor who had spent most of his career as a liberal republican since then according to a yankee institute report state revenues have expanded 71 percent faster than inflation but core spending needs haven t been the main priority the fastest area of budgetary growth spending on employee benefits and debt payments appropriately termed nonfunctional spending the high benefit costs set public workers in connecticut apart from their private sector counterparts one study found that two employees with equal education one working in government and the other in the private sector would earn similar salaries in the state about 70 000 yearly but while the private sector worker would typically enjoy the equivalent of 29 000 a year in employee benefits the public sector worker gets anywhere from 54 000 to 75 000 annually in pension health and other benefits union friendly laws make it tough to restrain these costs illinois pension woes among america s worst keep deepening because of unusually powerful constitutional protections which prohibit the state from altering the rate at which public workers earn retirement credits even for work they haven t yet done this is profoundly harming the state s viability when illinois hiked corporate and individual taxes in 2011 by some 7 billion a year more than half of the increase went right into the pension system instead of paying for say improved schools or roads similarly chicago with the lowest funded municipal pensions of any major u s city raised property taxes by half a billion dollars in 2016 just to afford its required pension payments the blue model is breaking down so fast and so far that not even its supporters can ignore the disintegration and disaster it now presages mead observes the blue model can no longer pay its bills and not even its friends can keep it alive blue state governments also tend to spend more to build tunnel construction is cripplingly expensive in places like new york city and boston for instance while europe and japan typically build tunnels for between 200 million and 660 million a mile according to calculations by israeli mathematician alon levy new york s number 7 subway extension cost 2 1 billion per mile while its second avenue subway line cost about 2 4 billion per mile the estimated bill for the east side access tunnel a project to connect the long island rail road to grand central terminal is a mind boggling 8 8 billion per mile meantime an aboveground extension of the bay area transit in san francisco will bill taxpayers about 170 million a mile almost as much as it costs in some european countries to build subways underground see why can t new york control its infrastructure costs summer 2018 the chief culprits are extraordinary labor charges cumbersome union work rules and political turf battles that governments in europe asia and other u s states somehow manage to avoid featherbedding is typical in blue model states tunnel boring machines in new york are manned by up to 25 workers twice as many as in nonunion states and nearly four times as many as in germany one government audit found that 200 of the 900 tunnel workers employed on the east side access project seemed to have no discernible job because east side access involved the long island rail road working on some amtrak controlled land unions at the two railroads fought over who should get the work a labor arbitrator essentially awarded the work to both leading to absurd overstaffing one portion of east side access constructed on amtrak land came in three years late at nearly triple the original 137 million price tag and labor costs far exceed those of anywhere else in the world unionized tunnel workers receive 111 an hour in new york compared with 38 an hour in detroit and less than 40 an hour in germany citizens pay for this not just in higher taxes and fees but in reduced efficiencies in early 2017 only 65 percent of new york city s subways arrived on time down from 86 percent five years ago as the system s aging switches and tracks malfunction these delays have occurred even as the subway system s revenues paid for in part by taxes levied on new yorkers have risen robustly from a little more than 8 billion in 2001 to nearly 16 billion today unfortunately costs have increased far more rapidly at 53 percent above the inflation rate since 2005 among the bills 1 9 billion for employee health care projected to swell to 2 6 billion in four years experts have calculated that the system spends 50 percent more per mile to move subway passengers than similar size metro service in london and paris one result is talk of service cutbacks and higher fares amid warnings from ratings agencies that the whole heavily indebted subsidized system could run out of money blue state government policies send building costs soaring higher a new york state law requires contractors to pay a prevailing wage essentially union wages on the billions of dollars in state and municipal building projects under way that elevates the price tag by 15 percent to 25 percent on the construction an empire center study finds new york city s school system will spend 1 4 billion in extra construction payments over the next five years and state efforts to renovate manhattan s javits convention center and finish work on the borough s moynihan station will cost about 340 million more along with higher wages the directive requires contractors to follow union work rules which pad the bill further so for example on a high rise new york construction site highly paid operating engineers must stand by to push the buttons on fully installed automated elevators observes the empire center s e j mcmahon advocates for unionized workers in high tax states often claim that government is right to demand that workers get paid more because living in such places is expensive they ignore how government itself affects the cost of living high property taxes make owning or renting a home more of a financial burden excessive corporate taxes and fees force firms to charge customers more regulations and mandates have a similar impact maddening housing regulations are a blue state model specialty states where residents are most dissatisfied with the availability of affordable housing are overwhelmingly high tax democratic locations according to gallup demographer wendell cox annually analyzes home prices and median incomes in major housing markets american cities ranked among the least affordable los angeles new york san francisco and san jose by contrast the most affordable cities include dallas houston atlanta indianapolis pittsburgh oklahoma city and cleveland some of the price discrepancies are demand driven new york is a more successful city than say cleveland but even rapidly growing red state cities like dallas atlanta and oklahoma city have kept housing prices moderate one reason suggest economists edward glaeser and joseph gyourko in a 2002 paper is that blue coastal cities in particular pile on zoning and other restrictions that push up land and construction costs making it less profitable for developers to build thus reducing supply igh prices have little to do with conventional models with a free market for land instead our evidence suggests that zoning and other land use controls play the dominant role in making housing expensive they state more recent research by economists peter ganong and daniel shoag reinforces the point metros like los angeles and san francisco are producing new housing at only half the rate of growing areas around the country such as dallas or indianapolis zoning restrictions are chiefly to blame for housing shortages ganong and shoag found in a 2015 study another recent study found that 15 communities in the heavily regulated boston region allowed just 4 062 new housing units per year far below the 14 000 needed to ease the area s housing crunch the difference in housing production between red and blue regions illumines the two american urban models suggests bloomberg columnist virginia postrel one encourages a growing population fosters a middle class family centered lifestyle and liberally permits new housing it used to be the norm nationally and it still predominates in the south and southwest she writes the other favors long term residents attracts highly productive work driven people focuses on aesthetic amenities and makes it difficult to build blue state model political enthusiasms make it harder for average citizens to afford basic necessities take energy california seeking to slash greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 has mandated a shift from more affordable fossil fuels to highly subsidized renewables its energy costs have risen 50 percent above the u s average notes a chapman university report a 2015 manhattan institute study estimated that 1 million californians now live in energy poverty defined as spending more than 10 percent of one s income on energy otherwise left leaning legislators from california s lower income minority districts have complained to the state s democratic leadership that the green crusade is weakening the economy and hurting the most vulnerable members of our communities even if california reaches its lofty emissions goal it will reduce greenhouse gases worldwide by less than 1 percent the costs of the blue state model have brought significant changes in migration patterns which have in turn heightened inequality according to ganong and shoag in fact nine of the ten states where inequality has grown most over the last quarter century are democratic dominated and every one taxes residents at higher rates than the national average by contrast every state where inequality has grown the slowest in that period is either politically neutral or republican led these figures underline the utter failure of one frequent political justification for high taxes to redistribute income from the rich and businesses to lower income residents and thus make society fairer as governor murphy claimed in his letter to texans the more that blue state politicians talk about inequality it turns out the worse it becomes in their states in general the blue state model makes life more difficult for lower income residents the census department s supplemental poverty measure adjusts state poverty levels by the local cost of living essentially measuring how many more people wind up in poverty based on state costs under that measure california has the nation s highest poverty level at more than 20 percent of the population more pointedly of the 12 states where the poverty level has worsened based on local costs seven are solidly blue including connecticut massachusetts new jersey and new york the rest are politically neutral the blue model states leave not just their poorer residents behind but also whole regions areas that specialize in highly productive industries like finance or technology can absorb the impact of high taxes and intrusive regulations easier than cost sensitive manufacturing or agricultural sections while the greater san francisco silicon valley area has prospered in the latest economic expansion five of the nation s ten metros with the worst unemployment rates are in california new york s economic rebound from the last recession was powered almost entirely by new york city the state has added about a million jobs since the recovery began but about 730 000 have been in gotham four large upstate areas have actually lost jobs higher state spending can bring some apparent advantages blue model states spend gigantic sums on their public schools from 50 percent to nearly 100 percent above the national average per student in places like new york and new jersey that s paid off in terms of quality according to a study by the financial website 24 7 wall st the list of top public schools by state includes massachusetts new jersey and new york government spending and quality may be more closely correlated in public education because school systems aren t controlled by state bureaucracies but by local school boards where parents especially in smaller suburban towns can demand accountability still fast as some of these states educate young people they re losing them as residents from 2011 through 2015 the three top states exited by millennials people aged 23 to 38 were heavily democratic new york illinois and new jersey according to one study based on census data fourth on the list was politically neutral pennsylvania whose taxes and overall costs are relatively modest except for property taxes which have been rising to pay for schools that study also found that the five states attracting the most millennials were less costly texas and colorado among them a report drawing on more recent data by a new jersey group found that young people not retirees were the biggest demographic group fleeing that state the data belie the explanation of some politicians like new york governor andrew cuomo that blue state out migration is largely about retirees leaving for warmer climes one challenge that the blue model states have in retaining younger people is mediocre public universities with the notable exception of california whose 1960 master plan for higher education engineered by then governor edmund pat brown elevated that state s system the u s news world report list of the top 11 there s a tie for tenth place state subsidized universities includes the university of michigan the georgia institute of technology the university of north carolina at chapel hill and the college of william and mary as well as six units of the california system beyond california though the blue state model performs much less well rutgers university new jersey s state college system ranks only 17th academically despite claims by governor murphy that jersey has world class universities he might have been referring to princeton university privately founded in 1746 when new jersey was ruled by a british colonial governor by contrast the university of texas at austin ranks higher academically than rutgers and it charges in state students 50 percent less for tuition similarly the top scoring public university campuses in connecticut maryland massachusetts and new york all rank even lower than rutgers suny at binghamton the academically best rated public university campus in new york is ranked just 32nd nationally the enormous resources of the high tax blue states might give a resident some hope that a reformer could reshape policies to make the states more livable yet some of these governments also have run up fantastic debts which will limit their options a recent american legislative exchange council study found that the states with the highest bonded debt per resident were overwhelmingly democratic and high tax such as connecticut and new jersey only one state that gallup categorizes as solidly right leaning south carolina was among the most indebted states though the government pension problem is bipartisan when you add the enormous pension liabilities of some blue model states to their bonded debt it s clear that they have already mortgaged away a significant part of their future revenues the impact of this debt can be seen already in the sharp drop in public sector unionization in blue states membership reached a peak in 2008 but has never recovered from the recession even after a nine year economic expansion the number of unionized government workers is down by some 350 000 members of course in many of these places no single politician or party is responsible for the debt accumulation connecticut amassed some of its biggest pension debts years ago when republicans ran the state and governors from both parties in new jersey have allowed pension debts to soar over the last 25 years even while they liberally rewarded public employees with new benefits new york s republican party has often embraced the blue state model nearly as enthusiastically as its democratic counterpart some red states also waste money on infrastructure boondoggles and mismanage pensions more spending won t cure what the public sector hasn t gotten right in his dallas morning news letter governor murphy told texans if you d like to be part of an economic revival in a state that recognizes the value of investments in public education creates welcoming communities that protect lgbtq residents and immigrants defends a woman s right to reproductive health care then new jersey is the place for you or your business he didn t mention that for years now residents and firms have been going in the opposite direction with texas attracting on average more than twice as many jersey residents as it loses every year to its northern rival that s a problem murphy would likely say that jersey could fix with just another few billion dollars of government spending photo by drew angerer getty images

mboe d for the full year in 2018 representing increases of 16 percent and 18 percent respectively compared to the same periods of 2017 these increases were caused by new volumes arising from a full year of operations from veresen midstream s sunrise tower and saturn facilities in 2018 increased utilization at duvernay i gas plant and the redwater complex and higher volumes at the majority of the other facilities as customers continued to increase production in the resource basins where pembina operates and complex and higher volumes at the majority of the other facilities as customers continued to increase production in the resource basins where operates and marketing new ventures division increased marketed ngl sales volumes by two percent to 201 mboe d in the fourth quarter over the comparable period in 2017 and generated quarterly operating margin of 121 million a 27 percent decrease over the comparable period in 2017 the decrease in operating margin in the fourth quarter was due to the lower margins on commodity sales as a result of lower crude oil and ngl market prices compared to the same period in 2017 combined with increased market based intercompany fees offset by the swing to a realized gain on commodity related derivative financial instruments compared to the realized loss in the same period of 2017 on a full year basis operating margin was 468 million in 2018 compared to 369 million in 2017 this increase was the result of the full year contribution from the equity accounted investment in aux sable executive overview 2018 was truly remarkable for pembina we strengthened our financial and operational performance driven by our diverse and strategically located assets strong customer contracts and the dedication and creativity of our customers and employees over this past year we continued to secure new business pursued growth projects operated safely and reliably and further enhanced our already strong relationships with the communities where we live work and play in 2018 we announced the next evolution in pembina s corporate strategy the move towards accessing global markets pembina is committed to identifying additional opportunities to connect hydrocarbon production to new demand locations through the development of infrastructure that would extend our service offering further along the hydrocarbon value chain these new developments will contribute to ensuring that hydrocarbons produced in the western canadian sedimentary basin and the other basins where pembina operates can reach the highest value markets throughout the world our recently approved pdh pp facility the prince rupert lpg export terminal currently under construction and our proposed jordan cove lng project are examples of such developments the most notable financial achievement over the past year was exceeding the high end of our original 2018 guidance range with adjusted ebitda of 2 835 million seven percent higher than the mid point of the original range contributing to this record breaking adjusted ebitda was the full year contribution from the greater than 10 billion increase in assets from the veresen acquisition and new assets placed into service following the execution of our large scale capital program completed in 2017 the veresen acquisition was transformational for pembina and we are pleased with how well the integration of staff and systems went bringing together two large and different organizations comes with a wide range of risks and yet through the diligent management of our integration team we are realizing the strategic and financial benefits of the combination along with record adjusted ebitda our 2018 adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share of 4 27 also was an all time high notably when comparing where we are now to where we were ten years ago we have grown volumes by 180 percent cash flow per share by 171 percent and the dividend by 50 percent over the same 10 year period shareholders have realized a total return of about 380 percent or 17 percent per year assuming reinvestment of their dividends our steady and growing dividend is one of the strongest ways we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to shareholders we have always worked hard to ensure our ability to pay a competitive dividend and the 5 6 percent dividend increase in 2018 represents our seventh consecutive annual increase since our inception pembina has returned over 6 9 billion to our shareholders and the dividend has never been reduced ensuring pembina continues to deliver a sustainable and growing dividend to shareholders remains a top priority continuing our dividend track record while growing the business requires a strong commitment to prudent financial management something that has always been fundamental to pembina as the company has grown we have also improved the risk profile of the business and strengthened our financial guardrails we have increased the percentage of our adjusted ebitda that comes from fee based business and our dividend is fully supported by these fee based cash flows meaning pembina is not reliant on the commodity exposed part of our business to fund the dividend in addition pembina has a very strong balance sheet low payout ratio and expects to fund our near term capital program without the need for external equity in 2018 we placed approximately 900 million of projects into service including the phase iv and v expansions of the peace pipeline system veresen midstream s north central liquids hub and saturn ii gas plant cavern developments as well as several other value added capital projects we also secured over 1 8 billion of new capital projects including the phase vi and vii peace pipeline expansions hythe developments and duvernay iii consistent with pembina s guardrails these projects are underpinned by long term fee based contracts that will generate incremental secure and predictable cash flow to support the stability and growth of the dividend with new projects placed into service in 2018 we announced an adjusted ebitda guidance range of 2 8 to 3 0 billion and a 1 6 billion capital program for 2019 we are entering the new year with positive momentum and already in 2019 pembina has secured the 500 million phase viii peace pipeline expansion and through our joint venture canada kuwait petrochemical corporation approved development of a 4 5 billion 2 5 billion net to pembina integrated pdh pp facility the prospects for future growth both within the base business and further extensions of our value chain remain robust we are as rich in growth opportunities as we have ever been which is a testament to both the resiliency and creativity of our customers and the underlying attractiveness of the western canadian sedimentary basin we look forward to the year ahead and are optimistic confident and excited to continue building something extraordinary new developments and growth projects

by kevin yao beijing reuters china s central bank is not yet ready to cut benchmark interest rates to spur the slowing economy despite cooling inflation and a stronger yuan which have fanned market expectations of such a move policy sources told reuters but the people s bank of china pboc is likely to cut market based rates and further lower banks reserve ratios rrr to boost credit growth and reduce firms borrowing costs according to the sources involved in internal policy discussions we cannot rule out a benchmark rate cut but we still need to watch economic data for a few months one said there is no sufficient reason for cutting benchmark rates if we look at the huge amount of new loans in january china s trading partners major central banks and multinationals from apple to caterpillar are increasingly concerned over how quickly the world s second largest economy is decelerating after a spate of weak data investors are asking if beijing needs to speed up or intensify support measures to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown analysts polled by reuters expect china s official growth rate to cool to 6 3 percent in 2019 a 29 year low and some believe real activity levels are already much weaker than government data suggest but china watchers note the pboc has many policy tools to choose from before turning to blunter instruments such as a lending rate cut which would lower financing costs across the board but risk adding to a mountain of debt more rrr cuts have been expected in coming quarters after five in the past year most recently in january the pboc has also been guiding money market rates lower in various ways and offered a slightly better rate on a new medium term lending programme launched in january the pboc did not immediately respond to reuters request for comment waiting for signs of a turnaround in one sign that recent policy loosening measures may be starting to be felt china s mostly state backed banks doled out a record 3 23 trillion yuan 480 43 billion in loans in january following months of urging by the pboc to keep financing open to cash strapped companies but the pboc was quick to say it has not opened the credit floodgates echoing comments by top leaders that beijing will not resort to massive stimulus like that in past downturns which buoyed growth not only in china but worldwide analysts note there is a time lag before a jump in lending will translate into growth suggesting business conditions may get worse before they get better but the government is also planning to step up fiscal stimulus ranging from more infrastructure spending to sweeping tax cuts building on moves last year in the last downturn in 2014 2015 china cut the benchmark six times but it has kept the benchmark unchanged at 4 35 percent since october 2015 while the central bank focuses on building a more market based regime that will get funding to parts of the economy that need it most only a handful of analysts have predicted a benchmark cut this time around but speculation has been growing that the pboc may take other action soon as deflationary pressures build and the yuan strengthens threatening more pressure on exporters data last week showed january producer price inflation cooled for a seventh straight month the yuan has gained about 2 6 percent against the dollar this year buoyed by hopes for progress in sino u s trade talks after falling 5 3 percent in 2018 lost in transmission while the pboc has been pushing ample funds into the financial system the money has not been flowing smoothly to companies particularly private firms which account for over half of china s economy banks have been wary of lending to smaller firms with higher credit risks preferring state backed customers while businesses are reluctant to take on debt when sales and profits are weakening bond defaults hit a record last year that has prompted the central bank to become more innovative in developing new policy tools most recently it allowed banks to issue perpetual bonds n a major step toward recapitalisation of the country s banks that could give them more room to lend pboc officials say policy steps are starting to show some results the average lending rate for small firms fell to 6 16 percent in january from 6 37 percent a year earlier but analysts say it is too early to tell if many firms are refinancing existing debt or planning new investments societe generale expects the pboc to cut the 7 day reverse repo rate by at least 20 basis points by end 2019 and could cut other market based rates while lowering rrr by 100 bps each quarter sources believe a benchmark cut may only happen if the economy slows abruptly and broad based deflation emerges but they expect stimulus measures will start to put a floor under economic growth around mid year a trade deal between china and the united states would also reduce the chance of a benchmark rate cut sources said negotiators are racing to meet a march 1 deadline for an agreement and failure could lead to a sharp hike in u s tariffs on chinese goods a benchmark cut could also been seen as a setback in long promised reforms to allow market forces to determine the cost of capital in china which is key to producing more sustainable and higher quality growth and reducing inefficient investment there are many tools in the central bank s toolkit and financing costs could fall as liquidity is ample and policy transmission mechanism improves said one of the sources 1 6 7231 chinese yuan renminbi reporting by kevin yao editing by kim coghill

cautious optimism has disappeared in 2019 by doug tilton special to the presbyterian news service louisville the cautious optimism that characterized the popular mood in zimbabwe at the beginning of 2018 had largely dissipated by the beginning of this year in january 2019 a huge fuel price increase triggered widespread protests that were brutally suppressed by security forces prompting concerns that zimbabwe is returning to the repression that marked the mugabe era in the midst of this turmoil the church is working to foster national dialogue that emphasizes the sanctity of the 2013 constitution and unity in diversity the november 2017 toppling of robert mugabe zimbabwe s leader since independence in 1980 seemed to create new opportunities for political expression and participation and mugabe s successor former vice president emmerson mnangagwa appeared to be committed to protecting freedoms of speech and association early reforms such the elimination of the requirement that all businesses in zimbabwe must be majority owned by indigenous zimbabweans had stimulated new commercial activity revised land policies prompted growth in tobacco cotton and maize output and mineral production also increased utilization of productive capacity grew from a low of 34 percent three years earlier to approximately 60 percent engendering hope for a sustained economic recovery since the july 2018 general election and its aftermath zimbabwe has faced many more challenges government spending has continued to outstrip revenues with a budget deficit of 11 6 percent of gdp in 2018 and an 18 billion public debt burden the flickering signs of economic recovery spurred a demand for currency namely the u s dollars that zimbabwe has used since 2009 that the import dependent economy was unable to meet the bond notes issued by the zimbabwean government intended to be of equal value to u s dollars devalued rapidly after the election and u s notes soon disappeared from formal markets most people had already come to rely on virtual currencies paying for goods and services with credit cards or cell phone based wallets inflation began to rise by about 10 percent per month reaching a reported 42 percent in december this has had severe consequences most notably causing hospitals and pharmacies to run out of imported medical drugs and rendering them unable to replenish stocks in addition the bbc reported that people paying in virtual currencies can be charged four times u s dollar denominated prices in october the government introduced austerity measures to reduce government debt and to stabilize the economy at the end of 2018 sen jeff flake r arizona the retiring chair of the senate foreign relations committee subcommittee on africa and global health policy held hearings on zimbabwe joseph mutizwa chair of the zimbabwe stock exchange listed companies forum cited a number of steps that the government had taken to stabilize the economy but agreed that there was still a long way to go at the same time mutizwa saw the economic sanctions imposed by the united states canada and the eu as inhibiting economic recovery conversely dr todd moss senior fellow at the center for global development argued that very little had changed in zimbabwe to justify relaxing u s sanctions the government constantly complains that economic difficulties are the result of u s sanctions rather than their own mismanagement and corruption moss observed pointing out that u s sanctions are targeted to 141 specific individuals deputy assistant secretary of state for africa matthew harrington agreed that there had been some promising signs from the government but warned that the pace and scale of reforms has been too gradual and not nearly ambitious enough he said that the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act clearly articulated conditions for the lifting of sanctions restoration of the rule of law a commitment to equitable legal and transparent land reform and the assurance that military and national police forces are subordinate to the civilian government since the beginning of 2019 social and economic conditions in zimbabwe deteriorated further in an effort to curtail demand for imports government announced a 150 percent increase in the price of fuel to roughly 12 50 per gallon giving zimbabwe one of the highest fuel prices in the world soaring fuel costs also caused the prices of other basic commodities to skyrocket some businesses including many private schools are accepting payment only in scarce u s dollars on jan 14 the country s major urban areas erupted in protests and zimbabwe s main labor federation called for a national stay away at least a dozen protesters were reported to have died in clashes with police and dozens more were injured press reports indicated that police were conducting house to house searches for people believed to have been involved in the demonstrations with up to 700 people detained and a number of women reporting rape the internet was effectively shut down in zimbabwe for several days in an effort to inhibit communication on social media amnesty international said it had documented a systematic pattern of human rights violations including restrictions on public assembly excessive use of force arbitrary arrests and internet shutdown by the security forces churches have been struggling to minister to members in the midst of social and economic turmoil the zimbabwe council of churches has been calling for a national dialogue based on the constitution to promote unity and build policy consensus speaking at a press conference last week rev dr kenneth mtata general secretary of the zcc said one of the biggest challenges we are having right now is the problem of a trust deficit even if you pour millions of dollars into zimbabwe right now when you don t have trust among zimbabweans those millions do not help you with anything that is why we are making this incessant call that the only solution we have for zimbabwe is dialogue we must allow the national peace and reconciliation commission to take a lead in this process mtata said but we are also aware that they are interested in working with churches and other bodies in zimbabwe he affirmed that a process was already under way but added the outcomes of the dialogue should be binding please continue to pray for the people of zimbabwe and for our partner churches the uniting presbyterian church in southern africa presbytery of zimbabwe and the church of central africa presbyterian harare synod in

part of the series progressive picks at the beginning of the 21st century latin america saw an upsurge of grassroots struggle that brought several left governments to power a historical moment known as the pink tide yet in the last few years popular discontent has grown toward these governments and far right leaders like jair bolsonaro in brazil have come to power what is happening to the latin american left is its decline solely the fault of us imperialism or were there fundamental problems in the project of 21st century socialism truthout spoke to author mike gonzalez about his new book the ebb of the pink tide the decline of the left in latin america gonzalez argues that the economic policies of pink tide governments and the ways in which they have wielded political power have recreated the popular discontent that brought them to power in the first place anton woronczuk in the introduction to the ebb of the pink tide you discuss how pink tide governments came to power during a time of mass struggle from the grassroots and cite bolivian president evo morales who described his government as a government of the social movements what gave rise to these movements mike gonzalez throughout the 1990s a newly confident neoliberalism imposed its domination across latin america the anodyne phrase structural adjustment concealed a devastating process of globalization that had begun as the berlin wall fell under the rules now imposed by the world trade organization wto for the global market all forms of state intervention in the economy were forbidden this meant state subsidies to farmers or transport for example welfare spending of any kind and so on these all fell under the definition restraint of trade that described anything that interfered with the pursuit of profit the first sign of things to come was the caracazo uprising of the poor districts across venezuela in february 1989 which began with a hike in the price of public transport the zapatista uprising in mexico in january 1994 which coincided with the north american free trade agreement nafta was a reaction to the removal of subsidies to maize farmers to allow the giant u s based monopolies free rein for the farmers it meant ruin the weakened states at best stood by and did nothing as the living standards of the masses collapsed at worst they sent in their repressive forces to deal with the rising protests in venezuela the caracazo was put down leaving a toll of 3 000 dead the local states collaborated with global capital acting as its agent there were rich rewards of course for the loyalty of the minority who profited from these arrangements the election of chávez was an expression of the gathering discontent though still in the formal framework of elections in cochabamba bolivia however the new militancy from below produced a direct confrontation over the privatization of the local water company in ecuador the indigenous movement that had created a national organization conaie in 1990 also mobilized against the new economic regime in ecuador s case expressed in the dollarization of the economy and in argentina the collapse of the economy produced in december 2001 an extraordinary movement under the slogan que se vayan todos let s get rid of them all them being the political class here too the movement embraced labor unions militant movements of the unemployed community organizations occupied factories students and others how did the relationship with these movements change after the pink tide governments came to power the important thing here is that the social movements arose independently of the state and of the political strategies and parties who were focused on state power john holloway s influential book how to change the world without taking power underlined this quality of autonomy and celebrated the independence of the movements for a few short years the movements were dominated by this idea of autonomy they acted outside the established political system independently of official political organizations and the parties of the left instead the movements produced new forms of resistance in bolivia the town hall assemblies or cabildos abiertos expressed a new concept of collective organization with an emphasis on internal democracy and horizontality in venezuela this movement from below expressed itself forcefully when the attempted coup against chávez failed because of the mass mobilization of the majority population in his support so the left governments were carried to power by a rising wave of grassroots resistance but the movement had no common project for power its independence was both a strength and a weakness the logic of grassroots democracy didn t fit with the logic of electoralism but the impulse from below was translated into the occupation of the state the movements demanded a direct participatory democracy not a new version of the representative system but who now claimed to speak on their behalf rose to occupy the state this contradiction is at the heart of both the pink tide as it rises and its ebb the movements demanded a direct participatory democracy but who now claimed to speak on their behalf rose to occupy the state many of these governments used anti capitalist discourse but still maintained relationships with foreign capital some of their defenders say the governments had to engage with extractivism such as mining in order to provide the material basis for socialism how would you respond to this argument the left governments came to power as a result of the mobilizations from below whose demands were economic the nationalization of natural resources and the socialized redistribution of the income realized from their exploitation but critically there was also a debate about dependency and the diversification of the economy to break the chains of that dependence on single product oil copper gold agro exports those two elements were interdependent at the same time there was a core political demand to do with participatory democracy the accountability of public officials and the recognition of the rights and citizenship of indigenous communities the recognition of indigenous rights was a cultural revolution but the other two elements had more far reaching consequences the promise to use oil and gas revenues for the direct benefit of the majority population through state services and public spending was the foundation of the left governments mass support but it also accepted and indeed deepened the core role of the extractive industries in their programs it was a contradiction which very quickly created tensions indigenous territories were often the sites of the major mineral deposits that guaranteed the income of the public sector in ecuador rafael correa who won the presidency in 2007 had within a few years criminalized and arrested indigenous leaders who were fighting the multinationals exploiting their territories by the mid 2010s all the pink tide governments were committed to a renewed and expanded extractivist program in conjunction with multinational capital in bolivia the protests by farming communities in the tipnis national park over the construction of a major highway facilitating the exports taken out of the country by brazilian and argentine multinationals produced a repressive response from the morales government the construction was suspended but then resumed in venezuela a leading indigenous activist sabino who was fighting the state coal company was murdered together with members of his family despite the high price of oil during the early part of the chávez regime diversification never happened though it was promised in venezuela social spending rose massively but so too did the level and scale of corruption which chávez finally recognized too late just before his death in 2013 so the promised break with global capital never came more taxes and royalties came into the national budget but the relationship with the global market did not change and the dependency deepened by the mid 2010s all the pink tide governments were committed to a renewed and expanded extractivist program in conjunction with multinational capital chinese canadian russian as well as u s resistance to which had produced the pink tide in the first place let s focus on the situation in venezuela you write while maduro s administration of venezuela has been and continues to be disastrous the roots of the problem lie in the chávez era yet chávez founded a mass socialist party and described his various initiatives as a transition to socialism while instituting state subsidized food and health programs that made a considerable difference in the quality of life for millions of venezuelans how did this political program create the conditions for the current crisis this is a very complex question but three elements are key first the promise to divert oil revenues to social spending this was hugely expensive because it was not planned the planning minister jorge giordani came into increasing conflict with chávez during his second presidency the absence of a plan resulted in policies created in a reactive short term way chávez was anti capitalist in his discourse but never had an anti capitalist strategy expropriations were purchases and often in reaction to the disinvestment or flight of a specific capitalist in his last document chávez recognized that far from transforming the state the state had transformed and corrupted his administration the deeper problem was that this created a relationship of a kind of welfare dependency between the majority and the state whatever chávez s intentions the united socialist party of venezuela psuv created in 2006 was not a mass democratic party but a centralized top down mechanism modelled on cuba the casualty was participatory democracy itself after 2006 chávez s appointees forged themselves into a ruling class mimicking the system of patronage and clientelism that had prevailed for 40 years before chávez in his last document chávez recognized that far from transforming the state the state had transformed and corrupted his administration but it was too late maduro s regime is authoritarian controlled by the military whose culture of command prevails at every level fuelled by corruption on a massive scale chávez did not have despite his proclamation of 21st century socialism a developed socialist project he was a revolutionary nationalist in 2016 maduro nailed his colors to the mast he announced the arco minero project inviting 150 foreign multinationals to exploit the huge mineral potential of the orinoco basin it was in my view the moment of counterrevolution what role do u s intervention and economic sanctions play in creating the crisis facing venezuela don t we need to emphasize the role of imperialism in the ebb of the pink tide neither maduro nor guaidó has anything to offer the millions who invested their hope in chávez from the perspective of today the u s is playing a central role in undermining the maduro regime but maduro s loss of support from his own chavista base has to do with his claim to socialist credentials while the population experiences unprecedented levels of hunger in the country with the world s largest oil reserves the coterie in power who head the psuv has replaced popular support with military control repression and violence together with corruption on a massive scale production has collapsed gdp is reduced by 50 percent and around 85 percent of necessary medicines and drugs are unavailable the remaining 15 percent are priced beyond the reach of most venezuelans the minimum wage of those who have a job will buy them a large pack of diapers or a dozen or so eggs yet no measures have been taken as opposed to promised to control corruption limit prices or suspend payment of the foreign debt the opposition parties concerned as they claim to be for the fate of the people have offered no program to address the crisis since they won their majority in the national assembly in 2015 the mass demonstrations they have called do not indicate mass support for the right let alone for its extreme wing to which guaidó belongs it reflects the level of desperation of all venezuelans who will seize on any opportunity to protest for socialists the only question is how best to strengthen and support the political resistance of a mass movement which has been disarmed by the manipulations of its leaders the most astonishing thing is the complacency of the international left who will defend this corrupt cynical regime the author of the crisis on the simplistic basis that maduro sounds like a revolutionary ignoring the reality of working class life in his venezuela neither maduro nor guaidó has anything to offer the millions who invested their hope in chávez of course u s imperialism is playing its usual role in latin america reclaiming its natural wealth for the profit of its home multinationals but the reality is that the choice is between several imperialisms the u s and guaidó russian and china with maduro for socialists the only question is how best to strengthen and support the political resistance of a mass movement which has been disarmed by the manipulations of its leaders but must now try to rediscover is strength and independence for the struggles to come one leader for whom you reserve cautious optimism is andrés manuel lópez obrador popularly known as amlo and you describe his anti corruption politics as serious but ambiguous since your book was published just as he came to power do you have a clearer assessment of what role his government will play in the mexican left the case of amlo in mexico is fascinating since he first entered politics and made his bid for the mexican presidency he has shifted his ground politically in 2006 he lost his bid for the presidency by a margin of less than 1 percent amid widespread and completely credible allegations of fraud given mexico s history in this regard the protests against the fraud produced a huge movement of protest that occupied mexico city s central avenue for almost a year he stood again in 2012 and 2018 each time attenuating his radicalism and seeking broader alliances his reputation for honesty and his record won him a mass following which finally led to his election to the presidency in 2018 his campaign emphasized the fight against corruption social justice and policies for dealing with the violence that has consumed the society for many years this was enormously popular especially given the record of the other candidates but his campaign had become increasingly populist and there were disturbing signs of compromise in the involvement of prominent right wing figures in his government and his policy team i would say that he has been cautious in his first 100 days though he refused to condemn the venezuelan government or recognize guaidó it may be tempting to see him as a new chávez but his support was electoral as was his political organization i would hesitate to characterize it as a social movement capable of independent mobilization so the mexican presidency remains as powerful and as centralized as ever amlo s relationship with trump too has been cautious and diplomatic his emphasis on morality and honesty is welcome in a corrupt mexican state but he will surely have in mind what has happened to the pink tide he will seek to maintain some degree of independence and cement his support through social measures where that will take him in the current volatile situation is hard to predict before you go

the steep declines caused by the 2008 global financial crisis have remained ingrained in investor psyche especially when a year like 2011 occurred so closely thereafter driven by contagion fears from the european sovereign debt crisis global equities delivered disappointing returns that year which kept investors on edge since then market participants have been on the lookout for the time when economic momentum would derail and stock markets would correct meaningfully however thanks to resilient economic growth the blips that were seen in 2015 and 2016 gave way to 2017 s extremely strong and consistent performance but 2018 was different to say the least through the end of december 2018 a 60 40 portfolio comprised of global stocks and bonds was down 3 69 this is only the second time in 28 years that both stocks and bonds are negative and the eighth time the 60 40 portfolio would have delivered a negative return1 in addition with cash now offering a yield greater than us large cap equities investors are likely no longer going to be forced to take on risk for return like they may have needed to do when rates were pinned to zero looking ahead to 2019 expectations are that we may need to accept growing uncertainty whether it be in regards to monetary policy the political environment or international relations the macro backdrop this economic cycle has been the slowest on record but also one of the longest looking ahead most well followed indicators are still pointing toward expansion however on a rate of change basis we are seeing many of these same measures begin to slow including the most recent purchasing manufacturing indexes pmis across developed and emerging markets which have remained in expansion territory but well below levels seen earlier in the year2 this does not necessarily point to an outright contraction anytime soon but illustrates the natural state of a lengthy expansion getting lengthier especially as additional means to stimulate growth may be limited as the multiplier effect of stimulus sees less impact at later stages of a cycle as opposed to coming out of a contraction related relative weight spotlight china is no paper dragon with this being the case economic growth is expected to slow marginally in 2019 after strong growth in 2017 and 2018 while long term impacts of the us tax cuts may be limited both critics and supporters say it may take years to draw conclusions on their effect but benefits should continue to be seen in 2019 as written in recent fed minutes the us economy is at or close to full employment highlighting that additional job growth may come at the expense of an overheating economy the results of the midterm elections will likely mean that there will be no additional tax cuts or meaningful spending packages coming down the pipe in the us especially when funding for border security is being used as a bargaining chip during the recent government shutdown figure 1 global growth is expected

have been unable to adequately resolve italy s recent budgetary issues highlight the latest in these trials the ecb recently announced that they will wind down its bond purchase program but will continue reinvesting its maturing bonds investors may actually see the ecb raise rates in the second half of 2019 or in early 2020 japan rising japan is expected to see modest growth in 2019 despite recent indicators suggesting that they may continue to face challenges since his election in 2012 prime minister abe has focused on a three pronged approach to stimulate growth with recent trade agreements among the latest accomplishments formally known as tpp the cptpp goes into effect this year along with the eu japan epa both of which will likely benefit the japanese economy of course even with these agreements slowing global trade is a headwind for the export orientated economy along with a recently strengthening yen making the picture on japan mixed lastly here is hoping that mother nature brings none of the natural disasters that the country experienced in 2018 emerging markets is this the year emerging markets face headwinds thanks to trade tensions and federal reserve tightening resulting in a stronger usd while the long term consumer growth story exists china s been actively restructuring its economy including looking to deleverage its growth of corporate debt that was built up post the end of the global financial crisis and now faces even greater questions driven by the ongoing trade spat in addition to the challenges from its ongoing transition away from a capital investment led economy to a consumption led one will rate rise pause in the u s while a narrow portion of the yield curve inverted spreads such as 2 year to 10 year and the 3 month to 10 year remain positive this flattening has been driven by the short end rising faster than the long end based on historical precedent the yield curve mayinvert in 2019 meaning that the potential for a us recession could be on the radar for 2020 due to energy prices being contained inflation should likely be subdued since peaking in early october inflation breakevens which measure the difference in yield between a nominal bond and an inflation linked bond of similar maturity have been on a steady decline highlighting that inflation expectations remain restrained as highlighted in figure 2 this may complicate the fomc s decision on its hiking path more so than the recent stock market volatility especially as they emphasized the need for data dependency figure 2 inflation expectations have declined source bloomberg finance l p as of december 31 2018 trade tariffs or truce from a risk perspective uncertainty around trade especially related to us and china will likely be a source of both upside and downside risks a bigger question resides around the fact that the norms of years past are subsiding as countries take a more unilateral approach to decision making and international relations complicating investors ability to accurately measure what truly may be coming next the markets in context with rates rising and stocks selling off valuations came down materially in 2018 but remain higher than historical averages on most measures looking back multiples first declined during the february sell off and never recovered much of this sentiment may be that investors are acknowledging that margins have likely peaked in this cycle caterpillar inc cat the global industrial giant gave the market hints of this back in july citing that their first quarter adjusted eps was the high watermark for the year more recently fedex corp fdx slashed its earnings guidance for 2019 warning that global trade is slowing overall many of the post financial crisis tailwinds such as surging profit growth and favorable risk appetite boosting multiples are now becoming headwinds in 2019 with technology creating more insights and connectivity than ever before we are experiencing a

and p e are for the msci acwi and normalized to 100 as of december 31 2017 past performance is not indicative of future results one of the main drivers of stock markets will be the direction of interest rates and how the ongoing perception of the path evolves historically periods of rising rates coincided with economic expansion but the extraordinary monetary policy which pinned rates to zero after the financial crisis complicates this relationship as rates were so low for so long even if rates do not rise materially above current levels investors will likely continue to focus on the yield curve with rising rates on the short end of the curve long duration assets have been negatively impacted these not only include bonds but equities with longer durations such as growth stocks related look to emerging market etfs for opportunities with economic growth remaining strong but slowing markets may be pushed and pulled along by geopolitical events and any surrounding rhetoric with daily catalysts less focused on fundamentals earnings will likely need to remain robust to help propel markets higher however expectations look to be lower than 2018 as it will be difficult for investors to assign higher multiples to lower growth as the sizable tax cut related boost will not be present in addition stocks are no longer the only alternative for investors to see capital appreciation thanks to cash now offering an actual yield with minimal concerns about its volatility with this being the case market participants remain skeptical in january 2019 but any string of positive news can provide support for equity markets figure 4 the yield curve continues its relentless flattening source bloomberg finance l p as of december 31 2018 basis points one hundredth of one

the calm of 2017 should be considered an anomaly figure 5 details the average intraday range of the s p 500 index one can see that 2017 s intraday ranges were a third of the historical average in fact 2018 s range is lower than the average as the year progresses markets may continue to price in the potential for recession or simply a material slowdown making in challenging to see trends last for long figure 5 s p 500 intraday ranges actually remain below historical averages source bloomberg finance l p data as of january 1 1988 december 31 2018 past performance is not indicative of future results what will matter most given the existing sentiment and subdued expectations for broad based performance going forward it will be important for investors to be more selective with where they make allocations in 2019 and beyond while day to day market moves will continue to be driven by headlines and investor sentiment over 12 to 36 month periods macro relationships tend to play a greater role us large cap small cap after years of outperformance large caps see relatively unattractive valuations compared to small caps driven with large cap multiples rising sharply over the past two years however small cap valuations are actually above historical averages at the same time earnings growth expectations remain lower for small caps than large caps highlighting that a catalyst for small cap outperformance may need to come from upside surprises as valuations alone may not provide support for a rotation looking to 2019 return differences between large and small caps will likely continue to be driven more by how investors value higher quality balance sheets and the potential for continued volatility as opposed to any headlines related to trade or taxes in other words if investors price in the need for more quality exposure and a need to hunker down large caps will likely benefit relative to small as small caps operate with higher balance sheet leverage and weaker capital efficiencies figure 6 source bloomberg finance l p as of december 31 2018 large cap represented by the russell 1000 index small cap represented by the russell 2000 index and vix represented by

value zealots have come out proudly trumpeting the opportunity for a long awaited shift to occur of course performance paints an easy picture for arguing for a reversal of the long run dominance of growth and recent flows suggest investors may be positioning accordingly however as witnessed over the past years these pockets of reversal have been short lived one of main reasons these periods have not persisted is that value stocks historically do best in periods of a steepening yield curve not a flattening one as steepening yield curves tend to be associated with improving economic growth where previously out of favor stocks may see a boost in their outlook in addition because of their cyclical nature value stocks tend to do best at the start of cycles making it challenging to see value stock performance to be sustained outside of a valuation led growth flush out which could certainly occur however the relative multiple between growth and value stocks has compressed to levels below the historical median making the case for further contraction mixed with value stocks offering less expected earnings and much lower levels of capital efficiency than growth stocks figure 7

by reuters by kevin yao beijing reuters china s central bank is not yet ready to cut benchmark interest rates to spur the slowing economy despite cooling inflation and a stronger yuan which have fanned market expectations of such a move policy sources told reuters but the people s bank of china pboc is likely to cut market based rates and further lower banks reserve ratios rrr to boost credit growth and reduce firms borrowing costs according to the sources involved in internal policy discussions we cannot rule out a benchmark rate cut but we still need to watch economic data for a few months one said there is no sufficient reason for cutting benchmark rates if we look at the huge amount of new loans in january china s trading partners and major central banks are increasingly concerned over how quickly the world s second largest economy is decelerating and much it will drag on global growth premier li keqiang reiterated on wednesday that china will not resort to flood like stimulus like that unleashed in past downturns but after a spate of weak data investors are asking if beijing needs to speed up or intensify support to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown analysts polled by reuters expect china s official growth rate to cool to 6 3 percent in 2019 a 29 year low and some believe real activity levels are already much weaker than government data suggest but china watchers note the pboc has many policy tools to choose from before wielding blunter instruments such as a lending rate cut which would lower financing costs across the board but risk adding to a mountain of debt more rrr cuts have been expected in coming quarters after five in the past year most recently in january the pboc has also been guiding money market rates lower in various ways and offered a slightly better rate on a new medium term lending programme launched in january the pboc did not immediately respond to reuters request for comment waiting for signs of a turnaround in one sign that recent policy loosening measures may be starting to be felt china s mostly state backed banks doled out a record 3 23 trillion yuan 369 77 billion pounds in loans in january following months of urging by the pboc to keep financing open to cash strapped companies but the pboc was quick to say after the data that it has not opened the credit floodgates analysts note there is a time lag before a jump in lending will translate into growth suggesting business conditions may get worse before they get better but the government is also planning to step up fiscal stimulus ranging from more infrastructure spending to sweeping tax cuts building on moves last year in the last downturn in 2014 2015 china cut the benchmark six times but it has kept the benchmark at 4 35 percent since october 2015 while the central bank focuses on building a more market based regime that will get funding to parts of the economy that need it most only a handful of analysts have predicted a benchmark cut this time around but speculation has been growing that the pboc may take other action soon as deflationary pressures build and the yuan strengthens threatening more pressure on exporters advertisement data last week showed january producer price inflation cooled for a seventh straight month the yuan has gained about 2 6 percent against the dollar this year buoyed by hopes for progress in sino u s trade talks after falling 5 3 percent in 2018 lost in transmission while the pboc has been pushing a lot of funds into the financial system the money has not been flowing smoothly to companies particularly private firms which account for over half of china s economy advertisement banks are wary of lending to smaller firms with higher credit risks preferring state backed customers while businesses are reluctant to take on debt when sales and profits are weakening bond defaults hit a record last year that has prompted the central bank to become more innovative in developing new policy tools to encourage growth most recently it allowed banks to issue perpetual bonds in a major step towards recapitalisation of the country s banks that could give them more room to lend pboc officials say policy steps are starting to show some results the average lending rate for small firms fell to 6 16 percent in january from 6 37 percent a year earlier but analysts caution it is too early to tell if many firms are refinancing existing debt or planning new investments dbs economists said recently that real interest rates the benchmark rate minus producer inflation have shot up to 4 3 percent advertisement societe generale expects pboc to cut the 7 day reverse repo rate by at least 20 basis points by end 2019 and could cut other market based rates while lowering rrr by 100 bps each quarter sources believe a benchmark cut may only happen if the economy slows abruptly and broad based deflation emerges but they expect stimulus measures will start to put a floor under economic growth around mid year a trade deal between china and the united states would also reduce the chance of a benchmark cut sources said negotiators are racing to meet a march 1 deadline and failure could lead to a sharp hike in u s tariffs on chinese goods a benchmark cut could also been seen as a setback in long promised reforms to allow market forces to determine the cost of capital in china which is key to producing more sustainable and higher quality growth and reducing inefficient investment there are many tools in the central bank s toolkit and financing costs could fall as liquidity is ample and policy transmission mechanism improves said one of the sources advertisement reporting by kevin yao editing by kim coghill

systems including assets placed into service in the prior year systems including assets placed into service in the prior year facilities division volumes of 924 mboe d in the fourth quarter and 877 mboe d for the full year in 2018 representing increases of 16 percent and 18 percent respectively compared to the same periods of 2017 these increases were caused by new volumes arising from a full year of operations from veresen midstream s sunrise tower and saturn facilities in 2018 increased utilization at duvernay i gas plant and the redwater complex and higher volumes at the majority of the other facilities as customers continued to increase production in the resource basins where pembina operates and complex and higher volumes at the majority of the other facilities as customers continued to increase production in the resource basins where operates and marketing new ventures division increased marketed ngl sales volumes by two percent to 201 mboe d in the fourth quarter over the comparable period in 2017 and generated quarterly operating margin of 121 million a 27 percent decrease over the comparable period in 2017 the decrease in operating margin in the fourth quarter was due to the lower margins on commodity sales as a result of lower crude oil and ngl market prices compared to the same period in 2017 combined with increased market based intercompany fees offset by the swing to a realized gain on commodity related derivative financial instruments compared to the realized loss in the same period of 2017 on a full year basis operating margin was 468 million in 2018 compared to 369 million in 2017 this increase was the result of the full year contribution from the equity accounted investment in aux sable executive overview 2018 was truly remarkable for pembina we strengthened our financial and operational performance driven by our diverse and strategically located assets strong customer contracts and the dedication and creativity of our customers and employees over this past year we continued to secure new business pursued growth projects operated safely and reliably and further enhanced our already strong relationships with the communities where we live work and play in 2018 we announced the next evolution in pembina s corporate strategy the move towards accessing global markets pembina is committed to identifying additional opportunities to connect hydrocarbon production to new demand locations through the development of infrastructure that would extend our service offering further along the hydrocarbon value chain these new developments will contribute to ensuring that hydrocarbons produced in the western canadian sedimentary basin and the other basins where pembina operates can reach the highest value markets throughout the world our recently approved pdh pp facility the prince rupert lpg export terminal currently under construction and our proposed jordan cove lng project are examples of such developments the most notable financial achievement over the past year was exceeding the high end of our original 2018 guidance range with adjusted ebitda of 2 835 million seven percent higher than the mid point of the original range contributing to this record breaking adjusted ebitda was the full year contribution from the greater than 10 billion increase in assets from the veresen acquisition and new assets placed into service following the execution of our large scale capital program completed in 2017 the veresen acquisition was transformational for pembina and we are pleased with how well the integration of staff and systems went bringing together two large and different organizations comes with a wide range of risks and yet through the diligent management of our integration team we are realizing the strategic and financial benefits of the combination along with record adjusted ebitda our 2018 adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share of 4 27 also was an all time high notably when comparing where we are now to where we were ten years ago we have grown volumes by 180 percent cash flow per share by 171 percent and the dividend by 50 percent over the same 10 year period shareholders have realized a total return of about 380 percent or 17 percent per year assuming reinvestment of their dividends our steady and growing dividend is one of the strongest ways we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to shareholders we have always worked hard to ensure our ability to pay a competitive dividend and the 5 6 percent dividend increase in 2018 represents our seventh consecutive annual increase since our inception pembina has returned over 6 9 billion to our shareholders and the dividend has never been reduced ensuring pembina continues to deliver a sustainable and growing dividend to shareholders remains a top priority continuing our dividend track record while growing the business requires a strong commitment to prudent financial management something that has always been fundamental to pembina as the company has grown we have also improved the risk profile of the business and strengthened our financial guardrails we have increased the percentage of our adjusted ebitda that comes from fee based business and our dividend is fully supported by these fee based cash flows meaning pembina is not reliant on the commodity exposed part of our business to fund the dividend in addition pembina has a very strong balance sheet low payout ratio and expects to fund our near term capital program without the need for external equity in 2018 we placed approximately 900 million of projects into service including the phase iv and v expansions of the peace pipeline system veresen midstream s north central liquids hub and saturn ii gas plant cavern developments as well as several other value added capital projects we also secured over 1 8 billion of new capital projects including the phase vi and vii peace pipeline expansions hythe developments and duvernay iii consistent with pembina s guardrails these projects are underpinned by long term fee based contracts that will generate incremental secure and predictable cash flow to support the stability and growth of the dividend with new projects placed into service in 2018 we announced an adjusted ebitda guidance range of 2 8 to 3 0 billion and a 1 6 billion capital program for 2019 we are entering the new year with positive momentum and already in 2019 pembina has secured the 500 million phase viii peace pipeline expansion and through our joint venture canada kuwait petrochemical corporation approved development of a 4 5 billion 2 5 billion net to pembina integrated pdh pp facility the prospects for future growth both within the base business and further extensions of our value chain remain robust we are as rich in growth opportunities as we have ever been which is a testament to both the resiliency and creativity of our customers and the underlying attractiveness of the western canadian sedimentary basin we look forward to the year ahead and are optimistic confident and excited to continue building something extraordinary new developments and growth projects

capacity and the project s 1 5 million concentrate regrind mill is expected to be installed in june 2019 the phase two capital expenditure capex is estimated at 39 9 million including the regrind mill

a cash cost of 1 30 to 1 45 lb and production of 2 5 million pounds of molybdenum in q1 2019 production will be lower than average and cash cost will be higher than average as mvc s mine plan extracts

international trade tensions that s one of the big global risks on christine lagarde s list lagarde has been the managing director and chairwoman of the international monetary fund since 2011 she s keeping a close eye on the current trade negotiations between the united states and china i cross my fingers every morning and my toes every evening because i hope that it is going to end up with a way to fix the system not break it because i do believe that the system needs fixing she told marketplace s kai ryssdal so if the outcome of the discussions between the u s trade team and the china trade team leads all of us in the direction of an improved framework where subsidies are well defined where state owned enterprises are well defined where intellectual property is protected where there is an encouragement to a rules based system that provides free fair and mutually beneficial trade then this is really an improvement ryssdal spoke with lagarde at the imf s headquarters in washington d c they covered a wide range of topics including economic anxiety and social mobility what we are seeing in many countries predominantly advanced economies is this sentiment that globalization new technologies are a threat are going to take your job are not going to improve the future of your children are taking you out of control of your destiny she said that s what a lot of people perceive below is an edited transcript of the full interview kai ryssdal i don t want to start sounding trivial but i do want to know how much time you spend and your staff explaining to people what the imf does christine lagarde you know i have rehearsed very carefully what is the imf what do we do and i don t spend an awful lot of time ryssdal really lagarde no what i often have to do is to explain what is the difference between the world bank and the imf ryssdal give me that give me 15 seconds on that lagarde so the world bank finances development and projects the imf does three things one we give financial support to countries that have a balance of payment issue in other words they can t pay what they re buying no 2 we give policy advice and no 3 we give technical assistance and training to countries that are trying to improve their financial management we never ever give grants we always lend and we always recover the money that we have lent ryssdal you ve been at the highest levels of global economic policy for a long time now both in france and now here at the imf describe this moment for me lagarde which moment ryssdal this moment we re in right now lagarde oh i see ryssdal because it s an interesting time for multilateralism in the global economy lagarde you know it s a strange moment because it s one where we still see growth 3 5 percent is the focus that we have a small 3 5 percent but we re seeing major risks on the horizon that could undermine that current growth position ryssdal say more on the risks you see lagarde the three categories of risks risk no 1 the tensions that we are seeing in international trade particularly between u s and china that has an impact on trade minimal but an impact it has a significant impact on confidence and it has an impact on markets so the combined three impacts trade markets confidence actually reduce global growth and certainly explain our downsided projection the second cloud on the horizon second risk is the financial risk where we are currently in a position where many countries many corporate many households are heavily indebted in many countries in nondomestic currencies and where we know that the financing costs will probably go up and the dollar is strong the third risk is that of an accelerated slowdown of growth in china which given the size of the chinese economy would have an impact outside of china and then you have some related risks such as uncertainty of the outcome of brexit in the u k and what impact it will have on the global economy and predominantly on the european union and any geopolitical risk that we have around ryssdal so to that subject of geopolitical risk and more specifically the role of the united states in the global economy today you are dealing with an administration that is if not openly hostile then deeply skeptical of what you and this organization and the world bank and many other multilateral institutions do how do you deal with that as a woman whose job it is to promote multilateralism i mean that s your thing now the new multilateralism lagarde you know i tell you it is not the case that the treasury department with whom we have a relationship because the treasury is representing the united states at the board of the imf so it is not the case that we have a bad relationship we actually have a good relationship with the treasury department and i m still to see a situation a case a country where we work where we are engaged and where the u s authorities at whichever level will say we are not happy with what to do we really do not support the institution i have seen like in the case of egypt in the case of ukraine in the case of jordan in the case of argentina significant engagement on the part of the u s authorities to support the work that we do in those countries ryssdal do you then discount the president s public position on multilateralism and institutions that work toward that goal because he s lagarde you know i m a very practical person the imf is an institution that includes 189 countries that is both a firefighter when there is a big financial crisis and an architect when it tries to give policy advice to countries and whether i m labeled a multilateralist institution or not is to me irrelevant what is relevant to me is the mission that we have to conduct which is to maintain and help financial stability around the world maintain and encourage prosperity and those are the driving forces of my mission of course i believe myself that multilateralism is the only way to deal with threats like cyberthreats like terrorism like pandemics like climate change because those issues know no borders and you can only address them and solve them and chase the threats if we act collectively in a multilateral setting ryssdal you know this is interesting because you re being very positive in your outlook for multilateralism but you wrote in a blog post first of all you re a blogger at the imf website you wrote a blog post last november called when history rhymes and you hearken back to the first world war in 1918 and the rise of inequality and the conflict and all of the horrible things actually that happened around that time and you say if we re not careful we re looking at that again reconcile what you just said with what you wrote in november for me lagarde i think those threats are there and certainly what we are seeing in many countries predominantly advanced economies is this sentiment that globalization new technologies are a threat are going to take your job are not going to improve the future of your children are taking you out of control of your destiny that s what a lot of people perceive ryssdal there are millions of people in the united states who believe that lagarde yeah no no no and you know it s not specific to the united states you know a movement in my country france like the yellow vest is also an expression of this anxiety about the future but this is not going to be solved appropriately by turning inwards by looking at your belly button it s going to be addressed by looking at the size of the problems the nature of the threats how it can be addressed and cooperation between countries as i said to you earlier on terrorism not a domestic issue climate change not a domestic issue cyberthreats not a domestic issue international trade obviously international by nature but what is domestic and what is critically important is to make sure that there is in place the protection the adjustment mechanisms so that people feel that they have control over their destiny people feel that it s going to pay back for them as well and that it s not because there is more robots more digitalization more artificial intelligence applied to their work their work site and their workplace that they re going to lose out that s where domestic policies meet international cooperation if you will ryssdal what do you make then of the trade negotiations that are happening now between china and the united states well i guess actually do we make too much of that should we just bank on them being solved lagarde i cross my fingers every morning and my toes every evening because i hope that it is going to end up with a way to fix the system not break it because i do believe that the system needs fixing there are multiple areas that are not covered by international trade rules there are many instances where trade is at risk of not being fair not being mutually beneficial the multiple instances where the definitions are out of date and needs to be improved and changed and adjusted to the present there has to be some realism applied to the trade relationship and i think that that is to the great benefit of what is happening at the moment so if the outcome of the discussions between the u s trade team and the china trade team leads all of us in the direction of an improved framework where subsidies are well defined where state owned enterprises are well defined where intellectual property is protected where there is an encouragement to a rules based system that provides free fair and mutually beneficial trade then this is really an improvement ryssdal do you believe though that the president of the united states has a grasp of economic policy at that level lagarde he s got terribly competent people around him to do that job you know i would not expect all presidents of all countries to actually master all these technicalities rules trade principles the zillions of tariff lines you know no president should be expected to know all that but to give the impulse of fixing the system and doing it in a collaborative way that s where a president has a decision in his hands ryssdal grade yourself for me would you you ve been on the job now going on eight years right you got a couple of years left how are you doing so far lagarde you know i might even have a third term why not ryssdal well we ll see how this interview goes i don t know people are listening lagarde it s not for me to say look the fact that the membership decided to reappoint me for a second term unanimously i took that as a token of appreciation and recognition of the effort that i put in every morning and the focus that i have on delivering on the mission ryssdal here s a better way to ask the question and i should ve done this the first time you came on this job in 2011 the world and certainly the american economy barely climbing out of the great recession have you been able to do what you wanted to do when you took the job lagarde you know when i took the job i was and everybody else was under the impression that the situation was improving significantly and that we were out of the great financial crisis and then suddenly the european sovereign debt hit our radar screen and we were back into the saddle of addressing those issues and putting you know more programs in place in order to help countries around the world so my job as i said is a bit like being a mixture of an architect helping frame policies focusing on what is macro critical including unusual subjects like participation of women in the workplace reducing excessive inequalities fighting corruptions and being a firefighter whenever there is a crisis on the horizon and a country knocks at the door to say i can t refinance myself i m in real trouble and we re i have to help ryssdal so we are here 10 years plus or minus after the crisis and i want to ask you about something you said early in your tenure at the imf that if lehman brothers had been lehman sisters the crisis either would ve been different or might not have happened at all elaborate on that now sitting here 2019 lagarde ok a few years later what has changed for me is that the imf now recognizes that the role of women in the economy can be macro critical and therefore warrants our focus our attention our research capacity and our policy recommendations what we have done very recently i just want to mention two numbers for you is a thorough study on the banking sector to see how many women were in executive boards or boards twenty percent only are women how many women are ceos or chairmen of banks two percent and then we tried to correlate the solidity of banks with the number of women sitting on the board and it s very interesting to see that those banks which have a significant number of women on their board are stronger are less likely to file for insolvency have bigger capital buffers have less nonperforming loans and are less risky interesting isn t it ryssdal it s totally fascinating and i will share another anecdote with you we have just come from an interview with janet yellen former fed chair she said to say hi by the way lagarde reciprocated ryssdal we re going to air that on monday and my producer and i were chit chatting with some of your staff before this interview and we said you know it s really interesting when you get those big group pictures of international economic meetings you have a whole bunch of guys and it used to be just christine lagarde and janet yellen lagarde it s raining men ryssdal and you have that picture now and it s just you lagarde i miss janet i do you know i m doing my best in my own capacity to encourage and support women because i think that they are huge contributors they can bring a lot to the table and in this institution for the first time i was privileged to appoint a chief economist who is a woman ryssdal right just recently right lagarde gita gopinath just recently and i will keep at it but i think that the economy professions particularly the macroeconomy professions has a serious shortfall in women and it s time that the economists actually look at it themselves and i trust that janet in her position will do that too ryssdal we had that actual conversation about her role as president of the and 2020 christine lagarde thanks very much for your time

principle non gaap financial measures these measures are widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance but do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by ifrs as an indicator of performance and may differ from methods used by other companies with similar descriptions these non gaap financial measures include cash costs per payable ounce of silver net of by product credits cash costs the company s method of calculating cash costs may differ from the methods used by other entities and accordingly the company s cash costs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities investors are cautioned that cash costs should not be construed as an alternative to production costs depreciation and amortization and royalties determined in accordance with ifrs as an indicator of performance adjusted earnings loss and adjusted earnings loss per share the company believes that these measures better reflect normalized earnings as they eliminate items that in management s judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors which are unrelated to operations in the period and or relate to items that will settle in future periods all in sustaining costs per silver ounce sold aiscsos the company has adopted aiscsos as a measure of its consolidated operating performance and its ability to generate cash from all operations collectively and the company believes it is a more comprehensive measure of the cost of operating our consolidated business than traditional cash costs per payable ounce as it includes the cost of replacing ounces through exploration the cost of ongoing capital investments sustaining capital general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affect the company s consolidated earnings and cash flow net cash generated from operating activities before changes in working capital is calculated as net cash generated from operating activities less changes in non cash operating working capital as shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows the company believes the exclusion of changes in non cash operating working capital better reflects the cash from operating activities generated in the period net cash generated from operating activities before changes in working capital does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures

incidentally to our silver mining activities we have adopted the practice of calculating the net cost of producing an ounce of silver our primary payable metal after deducting revenues gained from incidental by product production as a performance measure this performance measurement has been commonly used in the mining industry for many years and was developed as a relatively simple way of comparing the net production costs of the primary metal for a specific period against the prevailing market price of that metal cash costs per ounce metrics net of by product credits is used extensively in our internal decision making processes we believe the metric is also useful to investors because it facilitates comparison on a mine by mine basis notwithstanding the unique mix of incidental by product production at each mine of our operations relative performance on a period by period basis and against the operations of our peers in the silver industry on a consistent basis cash costs per ounce is conceptually understood and widely reported in the silver mining industry however cash cost per ounce of silver is a non gaap measure and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and the company s method of calculating cash costs may differ from the methods used by other entities to facilitate a better understanding of these measures as calculated by the

that the company considers to better reflect normalized earnings as it eliminates items that in management s judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors which are unrelated to operations in the period and or relate to items that will settle in future periods certain items that become applicable in a period may be adjusted for with the company retroactively presenting comparable periods with an adjustment for such items and conversely items no longer applicable may be removed from the calculation the company adjusts certain items in the periods that they occurred but does not reverse or otherwise unwind the effect of such items in future periods neither adjusted earnings nor basic adjusted earnings per share have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and are

the us shales continued to grow in 2018 following the previous year s strong recovery while drilling activity in canada was affected at the end of the year by the drop in oil prices for 2019 following the recent reset of oil prices us drilling activity is expected to be stable while in canada drilling activity is expected to be well below the level of last year in latin america a recovery in drilling activity in mexico is expected as the new government makes more funds available for pemex and private operators begin implementing their energy reform commitments in the rest of the regions drilling activity is expected to be relatively stable with shale drilling activity in argentina likely to switch from gas to oil in the eastern hemisphere drilling activity is expected to continue a gradual recovery with a focus on gas developments after our strong performance in 2018 we expect to consolidate our sales and margins through the year with sales and margins in line with those of the second half of 2018 we should benefit from growing sales of premium connection products for offshore projects around the world and the inclusion of consolidated revenues from our new operation in saudi arabia but we will not repeat the exceptional level of offshore line pipe shipments to the eastern mediterranean and will have lower sales in canada with a stable level of sales and limited

states canada and mexico in south america sales increased due to higher sales of octg products in the andean region and higher sales of line pipe in argentina in europe sales remained stable across the region and for the different products in the middle east and africa sales increased significantly as we completed deliveries of zohr s offshore line pipe in the east mediterranean in asia pacific we had stable sales operating income from tubular products and services amounted to 154 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 233 million in the previous quarter and 150 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 operating income during the quarter was negatively affected by a higher customer relationships amortization charge of 109 million after the full amortization of the residual value of maverick s tubes segment customer relationships excluding this one off effect operating income would have increased 13 mainly thanks to an increase in shipments that improved the utilization

quarter and 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the loss during the quarter corresponds mainly to the effect of an 8 6 appreciation of the argentine peso on net fiscal trade and financial

the residual useful life of maverick s tubes segment customer relationships on the other hand we recorded a charge of 19 million due to the effect on the tax base used to calculate deferred taxes of

exclusive china central bank sees benchmark rate cut as last resort may use other tools sources file photo a chinese national flag flutters outside the headquarters of the people s bank of china the chinese central bank in beijing china april 3 2014 reuters petar kujundzic file photo by kevin yao beijing reuters china s central bank is not yet ready to cut benchmark interest rates to spur the slowing economy despite cooling inflation and a stronger yuan which have fanned market expectations of such a move policy sources told reuters but the people s bank of china pboc is likely to cut market based rates and further lower banks reserve ratios rrr to boost credit growth and reduce firms borrowing costs according to the sources involved in internal policy discussions we cannot rule out a benchmark rate cut but we still need to watch economic data for a few months one said there is no sufficient reason for cutting benchmark rates if we look at the huge amount of new loans in january china s trading partners and major central banks are increasingly concerned over how quickly the world s second largest economy is decelerating and much it will drag on global growth premier li keqiang reiterated on wednesday that china will not resort to flood like stimulus like that unleashed in past downturns but after a spate of weak data investors are asking if beijing needs to speed up or intensify support to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown advertisement advertisement analysts polled by reuters expect china s official growth rate to cool to 6 3 percent in 2019 a 29 year low and some believe real activity levels are already much weaker than government data suggest but china watchers note the pboc has many policy tools to choose from before wielding blunter instruments such as a lending rate cut which would lower financing costs across the board but risk adding to a mountain of debt more rrr cuts have been expected in coming quarters after five in the past year most recently in january the pboc has also been guiding money market rates lower in various ways and offered a slightly better rate on a new medium term lending program launched in january the pboc did not immediately respond to reuters request for comment advertisement advertisement waiting for signs of a turnaround in one sign that recent policy loosening measures may be starting to be felt china s mostly state backed banks doled out a record 3 23 trillion yuan 480 43 billion in loans in january following months of urging by the pboc to keep financing open to cash strapped companies but the pboc was quick to say after the data that it has not opened the credit floodgates analysts note there is a time lag before a jump in lending will translate into growth suggesting business conditions may get worse before they get better but the government is also planning to step up fiscal stimulus ranging from more infrastructure spending to sweeping tax cuts building on moves last year advertisement advertisement in the last downturn in 2014 2015 china cut the benchmark six times but it has kept the benchmark at 4 35 percent since october 2015 while the central bank focuses on building a more market based regime that will get funding to parts of the economy that need it most only a handful of analysts have predicted a benchmark cut this time around but speculation has been growing that the pboc may take other action soon as deflationary pressures build and the yuan strengthens threatening more pressure on exporters data last week showed january producer price inflation cooled for a seventh straight month the yuan has gained about 2 6 percent against the dollar this year buoyed by hopes for progress in sino u s trade talks after falling 5 3 percent in 2018 advertisement advertisement lost in transmission while the pboc has been pushing a lot of funds into the financial system the money has not been flowing smoothly to companies particularly private firms which account for over half of china s economy banks are wary of lending to smaller firms with higher credit risks preferring state backed customers while businesses are reluctant to take on debt when sales and profits are weakening bond defaults hit a record last year that has prompted the central bank to become more innovative in developing new policy tools to encourage growth most recently it allowed banks to issue perpetual bonds in a major step toward recapitalization of the country s banks that could give them more room to lend advertisement advertisement pboc officials say policy steps are starting to show some results the average lending rate for small firms fell to 6 16 percent in january from 6 37 percent a year earlier but analysts caution it is too early to tell if many firms are refinancing existing debt or planning new investments dbs economists said recently that real interest rates the benchmark rate minus producer inflation have shot up to 4 3 percent societe generale expects pboc to cut the 7 day reverse repo rate by at least 20 basis points by end 2019 and could cut other market based rates while lowering rrr by 100 bps each quarter sources believe a benchmark cut may only happen if the economy slows abruptly and broad based deflation emerges but they expect stimulus measures will start to put a floor under economic growth around mid year advertisement advertisement a trade deal between china and the united states would also reduce the chance of a benchmark cut sources said negotiators are racing to meet a march 1 deadline and failure could lead to a sharp hike in u s tariffs on chinese goods a benchmark cut could also been seen as a setback in long promised reforms to allow market forces to determine the cost of capital in china which is key to producing more sustainable and higher quality growth and reducing inefficient investment there are many tools in the central bank s toolkit and financing costs could fall as liquidity is ample and policy transmission mechanism improves said one of the sources reporting by kevin yao editing by kim coghill

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s consumer prices were unchanged for a third straight month in january leading to the smallest annual increase in inflation in more than 1 1 2 years which could allow the federal reserve to hold interest rates steady for a while the labor department s report on wednesday supported the fed s recent description of price pressures being muted in a policy statement last month the u s central bank kept rates unchanged pledged to be patient before tightening monetary policy further and discarded promises of further gradual increases in borrowing costs inflation still appears to be well in check said jim baird chief investment officer at plante moran financial advisors in kalamazoo michigan that should be enough for the fed to take time to evaluate the gradual effects of its prior rate hikes and move more slowly and thoughtfully in administering rate policy in the months ahead the consumer price index last month was held down by cheaper gasoline which offset increases in the cost of food rent healthcare recreation apparel motor vehicles and household furnishings in the 12 months through january the cpi rose 1 6 percent the smallest gain since june 2017 the cpi increased 1 9 percent on a year on year basis in december excluding the volatile food and energy components the cpi gained 0 2 percent rising by the same margin for a fifth straight month in the 12 months through january the so called core cpi rose 2 2 percent for a third straight month economists polled by reuters had forecast the cpi edging up 0 1 percent in january and the core cpi rising 0 2 percent while the steady increases in core inflation resulted in the biggest three month annualized gain in 10 months economists said they did not believe it signaled a material shift in underlying inflation trends the fed will be focused more on longer time frames said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein in new york the quarter on quarter annualized figure has moved both higher and lower without signaling any meaningful change in the year on year rate before story continues the dollar dxy rose against a basket of currencies as traders focused on the three month rise in the core cpi prices of u s treasuries fell stocks on wall street were trading higher amid optimism that the united states and china could strike a deal during trade talks in beijing little upside risk despite the increases in the core cpi underlying inflation remains moderate the fed which has a 2 percent inflation target tracks a different measure the core personal consumption expenditures pce price index for monetary policy the core pce price index increased 1 9 percent on a year on year basis in november after rising 1 8 percent in october it hit 2 percent in march 2018 for the first time since april 2012 pce price data for december will be released on march 1 it was delayed by a five week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on jan 25 inflation is remaining moderate despite a tightening labour market in part because of slowing economic growth in china and europe which is helping to lower oil prices we don t see a tonne of upside risk to inflation over the next several months said ryan sweet a senior economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania the unemployment rate could fall even further without stoking significant inflation since the slope of the phillips curve remains flat the phillips curve describes the relationship between inflation and unemployment it holds that as unemployment declines inflation should rise in the current environment the lack of a strong inflation impulse suggests there is no danger of the labour market overheating in january gasoline prices fell 5 5 percent after dropping 5 8 percent in december food prices increased 0 2 percent rising for a third straight month there were increases in the prices of poultry eggs fish and beef but consumers paid less for fruits vegetables cereals and dairy products owners equivalent rent of primary residence which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home increased 0 3 percent in january after gaining 0 2 percent in the prior month the cost of postage stamps jumped 1 7 percent the most since february 2013 healthcare costs rose 0 2 percent after advancing 0 3 percent in december with doctor visits costing more apparel prices surged 1 1 percent last month the biggest increase since february 2018 airline fares dropped 0 9 percent the cost of motor vehicle insurance fell for a third straight month reporting by lucia mutikani editing by paul simao

when it comes to the chinese yuan president trump just seems to get more and more confused you may recall that during the 2016 campaign trump accused china of currency manipulation he wasn t wrong then the chinese government does deliberately keep the yuan undervalued relative to the u s dollar making their exports cheaper and widening america s trade deficit with china but once trump entered office and commenced his trade war he dropped the subject of china s currency policy instead he focused on changing china s rules around market access investment technology transfer and intellectual property now the yuan is back the white house reportedly wants china to commit to keeping the value of the yuan stable as part of the ongoing trade negotiations subscribe to the week escape your echo

get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox from our morning news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up nothing about this evolution makes a great deal of sense trump was closest to the mark at the beginning the u s dollar s dominant role in international exchange means that any country engaged in trade including china needs to maintain some stockpile of the currency but china s central bank holds around 3 trillion in dollar reserves and its wealth fund holds another 1 5 trillion in assets all of which wildly exceeds the amount that s necessary for straightforward trade management the sheer fact that those stockpiles exist and are as big as they are puts continuous upward pressure on the value of the dollar in international exchange markets that makes american exports more expensive and chinese imports less expensive which does real damage to u s workers in export heavy industries which tend to be more working class and blue collar now officially accusing china of currency manipulation through international setups like the world trade organization would be a complicated and fraught business and there are actually purely domestic policies that could fix the problem without having to fight with china at all we could just bulk up domestic demand by doing a lot of deficit financed industrial policy a green new deal anyone or we could get more creative and have institutions like the federal reserve stockpile chinese currency to neutralize the effect of china s dollar reserves

brands receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors neither of those solutions seem like ones trump s white house could pull off or is even interested in but bringing up the subject of china s currency at least showed that the president was in the vicinity of a correct diagnosis then the subject disappeared once trump went to work china s domestic market is something of a wild west when it comes to intellectual property protections the government also has a ton of rules that restrict foreign companies like u s owned ones from investing or opening up shop in china s domestic market they usually have to partner with chinese owned firms to do so which usually means sharing technology and trade secrets now that trump s trade war has forced china to the bargaining table getting its government to reform all those practices is the white house s focus the problem there is that if jobs and wages for american workers are your primary concern things like investor access to china s market and technology transfer are really neither here nor there if the white house gets what it wants those changes would certainly fatten the profit margins of some u s based companies but there s no reason to think the benefits would trickle down does that mean it s a good thing that trump is finally talking about china s currency policy again not really the key problem is his demand for stability as i mentioned the value of the yuan has been chronically too low relative to the u s dollar for a while now again if our goal is more american jobs and higher wages we don t want the yuan to remain stable we want its value to increase relative to the dollar indeed with the exception of one big drop in value in 2015 and 2016 which china did for a lot of complicated reasons the yuan s value hasn t really moved that much in the last few years stability is basically what china is already delivering many economists and experts aren t thrilled with this demand for stability either but that s largely because they d like china to allow its currency to float on international markets meaning the value of the yuan could go up or down depending on how market forces act on it stability isn t terribly consistent with that goal either as a long term solution down the road allowing the yuan to float wouldn t be the worst thing in the world whether china would ever agree to go that far is another question entirely at the same time the idea that there s a self correcting market in major currencies out there free from interference by major governments is more of a hopeful centrist fantasy than a functioning reality at any rate if you follow the trump administration s own logic they re basically demanding stability in the yuan to protect their tariffs trump slapped those tariffs on china to force it to negotiate and he wants to use those negotiations to make china s domestic market friendlier to u s investors the white house s concern is that china could neutralize the tariffs by dropping the value of its currencies again and the stability commitment is meant to prevent that in other words the white house s trade strategy towards china is still captured by the interests of big business and given trump s original promise to help the forgotten men and women of america that still doesn t add up
us dollar exchange rates little changed after yesterday s fed minutes pound sterling strengthens on speculation that a brexit deal will be reached soon the pound to euro exchange rate is is 0 16 higher 1 15147 today the pound to dollar exchange rate is is 0 25 higher 1 30773 today overnight the british pound was a notable under performer overnight as weakness accelerated in sterling as theresa may has continued to talk to the eu and no progress has been made the real story in uk politics is the defection of three moderate conservatives from the main party joining the labour departees from the day before while sarah wollaston heidi allen and anna soubry are not the highest ranking of conservatives the backlash against hard line brexiteers continues for now the effect on the gbp is unlikely to be too significant as while they might be detaching themselves from theresa may their votes in parliament will be as pro remain as ever advertisement analyst view barclays bank gbpusd traded through 1 3100 yesterday before retracing overnight news yesterday morning that three conservative mps had defected to the newly formed independent group weighed on sterling but it traded higher during talks between uk pm may and ec president juncker which were later described as constructive bloomberg fomc notes were somewhat dovish but the usd continued to trade relatively firmly while momentum in stocks was seen with the nikkei 225 marching out 0 3 to start the session and oil prices also rising gradually analyst view kjetil olsen nordea markets the fed will end qt in the second half of 2019 as expected by the market this was the clear message from the minutes of the january meeting it has already improved market conditions and we keep the forecast of one more hike before the fed is done overall the market s reaction seems muted but with a slight hawkish tilt one hour after the release of the minutes the two year treasury yield which is closely related to expectations of the fed funds rate had increased by two bp and the ten years note with one bp the equity market initially came down somewhat but recovered earlier gain soon again analyst view lloyds bank the minutes of the january us fed policy setting meeting had mixed implications for markets they showed that all committee members thought that their balance sheet rundown should end this year however members remain divided on whether interest rates should rise further and there was no hint that they will be cut anytime soon the day ahead today sees a lot of high profile european economic data with the german cpi alongside european pmis this could see plenty of volatility in the euro exchange rates particularly as any german data is very significant for the outlook for the bloc as a whole analyst preview lloyds bank the february flash estimates for the eurozone pmis will give an indication of whether the slowdown in the region has continued into february the german zew survey released earlier this week showed a further deterioration in current conditions but a rebound in expectations albeit from relatively low levels as the pmi surveys actual companies it should be a more reliable indicator of economic activity we expect a further slide in both the manufacturing and services indices analyst view marshall gittler chief strategist head of education acls global in europe the french manufacturing pmi is expected to be done a bit germany is expected to be up a bit but still below 50 but the eurozone as a whole is expected to be down a bit that s on the manufacturing side which is what really counts on services the eurozone as a whole is expected to be up a bit and therefore so too is the composite index but it s the manufacturing pmi that defines the economic cycle and so is what people pay attention to in any event the continued gradual erosion of momentum fits in with the dominant narrative in the markets nowadays that as ecb executive board member benoit coeure said last week the slowdown in the eu is clearly stronger and broader than had been thought previously in that respect it should be negative for the euro in the us there is also some significant pmi data with manufacturing and services pmi s worth looking out for alongside new home sales analyst preview marshall gittler chief strategist head of education acls global in the us the philadelphia fed manufacturing index is expected to be down slightly following the previous month s strong gain this is in contrast to last week s empire state index which was higher but really the impression from the two of them would be more of sideways movement overall and they remain firmly in positive territory suggesting continued expansion at a healthy pace that should be neutral to positive for usd in the uk public sector borrowing is expected to have skyrocketed with 11 billion the expected consensus reading a shocking change from the 2 billion credit seen at the last release analyst preview lloyds bank today s uk public finances data for january will be an important indicator of whether the deficit for this fiscal year is set to come in at around target as january contains self assessment receipts a substantial surplus is usually posted our forecast of a 10 2bn monthly surplus is probably the minimum needed to keep the public finances on track a deficit close to target would be an indication that the government has some room for an easing in fiscal policy if economic conditions deteriorate 07 00 eur german cpi yoy jan 07 00 eur german cpi mom jan 07 00 eur

3030 into the close analyst view marshall gittler chief strategist head of education acls global gbp was little changed despite a lot of interesting developments no substantial changes but interesting developments in britain uk pm may and ec president juncker released a joint statement outlining plans for a modest revamp of the draft brexit package whether this will be enough to mollify the anti eu cabal is anyone s guess eur usd also chopped sideways around 1 1350 as the fomc notes ended up having a relatively neutral effect on markets prospects for the us dollar might be fading in many forecasts but the reality is that the drop that a lot of institutions are looking for has failed to materialise so far analysts at fx giant citibank believe that longer term these forecasts might prove to be correct as the trump fiscal stimulus fades in terms of the delta to economic activity we think long term yields have likely peaked the spot us curve will continue to flatten which may undermine the usd looking less long term citibank do believe the usd edge could begin to fade and anticipate other major currencies could make up lost ground more medium term as yield spreads fall fx depreciation likely continues in our forecasts as us developments become less positive policy elsewhere may support other currencies this cumulates in a neutral forecast from citibank although they do see potential for an upswing in the us if there are any bouts of poor risk sentiment in markets our point forecasts show the around flat vs g10 over 0 3m and around 3 4 weaker over 6 12m positive factors in the event of severe risk off in markets usd may resume its safe haven status which may support the usd plenty of top tier data could make this a relatively volatile day but again look out

capital of 105 2 million in 2018 was slightly above our forecast range of 100 to 105 million reflecting higher pre stripping and leach pad expansionary activities at dolores largely offset with

principle non gaap financial measures these measures are widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance but do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by ifrs as an indicator of performance and may differ from methods used by other companies with similar descriptions these non gaap financial measures include cash costs per payable ounce of silver net of by product credits cash costs the company s method of calculating cash costs may differ from the methods used by other entities and accordingly the company s cash costs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities investors are cautioned that cash costs should not be construed as an alternative to production costs depreciation and amortization and royalties determined in accordance with ifrs as an indicator of performance adjusted earnings loss and adjusted earnings loss per share the company believes that these measures better reflect normalized earnings as they eliminate items that in management s judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors which are unrelated to operations in the period and or relate to items that will settle in future periods all in sustaining costs per silver ounce sold aiscsos the company has adopted aiscsos as a measure of its consolidated operating performance and its ability to generate cash from all operations collectively and the company believes it is a more comprehensive measure of the cost of operating our consolidated business than traditional cash costs per payable ounce as it includes the cost of replacing ounces through exploration the cost of ongoing capital investments sustaining capital general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affect the company s consolidated earnings and cash flow net cash generated from operating activities before changes in working capital is calculated as net cash generated from operating activities less changes in non cash operating working capital as shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows the company believes the exclusion of changes in non cash operating working capital better reflects the cash from operating activities generated in the period net cash generated from operating activities before changes in working capital does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures

incidentally to our silver mining activities we have adopted the practice of calculating the net cost of producing an ounce of silver our primary payable metal after deducting revenues gained from incidental by product production as a performance measure this performance measurement has been commonly used in the mining industry for many years and was developed as a relatively simple way of comparing the net production costs of the primary metal for a specific period against the prevailing market price of that metal cash costs per ounce metrics net of by product credits is used extensively in our internal decision making processes we believe the metric is also useful to investors because it facilitates comparison on a mine by mine basis notwithstanding the unique mix of incidental by product production at each mine of our operations relative performance on a period by period basis and against the operations of our peers in the silver industry on a consistent basis cash costs per ounce is conceptually understood and widely reported in the silver mining industry however cash cost per ounce of silver is a non gaap measure and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and the company s method of calculating cash costs may differ from the methods used by other entities to facilitate a better understanding of these measures as calculated by the

that the company considers to better reflect normalized earnings as it eliminates items that in management s judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors which are unrelated to operations in the period and or relate to items that will settle in future periods certain items that become applicable in a period may be adjusted for with the company retroactively presenting comparable periods with an adjustment for such items and conversely items no longer applicable may be removed from the calculation the company adjusts certain items in the periods that they occurred but does not reverse or otherwise unwind the effect of such items in future periods neither adjusted earnings nor basic adjusted earnings per share have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and are

principle non gaap financial measures these measures are widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance but do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by ifrs as an indicator of performance and may differ from methods used by other companies with similar descriptions these non gaap financial measures include cash costs per payable ounce of silver net of by product credits cash costs the company s method of calculating cash costs may differ from the methods used by other entities and accordingly the company s cash costs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities investors are cautioned that cash costs should not be construed as an alternative to production costs depreciation and amortization and royalties determined in accordance with ifrs as an indicator of performance adjusted earnings loss and adjusted earnings loss per share the company believes that these measures better reflect normalized earnings as they eliminate items that in management s judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors which are unrelated to operations in the period and or relate to items that will settle in future periods all in sustaining costs per silver ounce sold aiscsos the company has adopted aiscsos as a measure of its consolidated operating performance and its ability to generate cash from all operations collectively and the company believes it is a more comprehensive measure of the cost of operating our consolidated business than traditional cash costs per payable ounce as it includes the cost of replacing ounces through exploration the cost of ongoing capital investments sustaining capital general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affect the company s consolidated earnings and cash flow net cash generated from operating activities before changes in working capital is calculated as net cash generated from operating activities less changes in non cash operating working capital as shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows the company believes the exclusion of changes in non cash operating working capital better reflects the cash from operating activities generated in the period net cash generated from operating activities before changes in working capital does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures

incidentally to our silver mining activities we have adopted the practice of calculating the net cost of producing an ounce of silver our primary payable metal after deducting revenues gained from incidental by product production as a performance measure this performance measurement has been commonly used in the mining industry for many years and was developed as a relatively simple way of comparing the net production costs of the primary metal for a specific period against the prevailing market price of that metal cash costs per ounce metrics net of by product credits is used extensively in our internal decision making processes we believe the metric is also useful to investors because it facilitates comparison on a mine by mine basis notwithstanding the unique mix of incidental by product production at each mine of our operations relative performance on a period by period basis and against the operations of our peers in the silver industry on a consistent basis cash costs per ounce is conceptually understood and widely reported in the silver mining industry however cash cost per ounce of silver is a non gaap measure and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and the company s method of calculating cash costs may differ from the methods used by other entities to facilitate a better understanding of these measures as calculated by the

primary business segments warehouse third party managed and transportation our core business is our warehouse segment where we provide temperature controlled warehouse storage and related handling and other warehouse services in our warehouse segment we collect rent and storage fees from customers to store their frozen and perishable food and other products within our real estate portfolio we also provide our customers with handling and other warehouse services related to the products stored in our buildings that are designed to optimize their movement through the cold chain such as the placement of food products for storage and preservation the retrieval of products from storage upon customer request blast freezing case picking kitting and repackaging and other recurring handling services under our third party managed segment we manage warehouses on behalf of third parties and provide warehouse management services to several leading food retailers and manufacturers in customer owned facilities including some of our largest and longest standing customers we believe using our third party management services allows our customers to increase efficiency reduce costs reduce supply chain risks and focus on their core businesses we also believe that providing third party management services to many of our key customers underscores our ability to offer a complete and integrated suite of services across the cold chain in our transportation segment we broker and manage transportation of frozen and perishable food and other products for our customers our transportation services include consolidation services i e consolidating a customer s products with those of other customers for more efficient shipment freight under management services i e arranging for and overseeing transportation of customer inventory and dedicated transportation services each designed to improve efficiency and reduce transportation and logistics costs to our customers we provide these transportation services at cost plus a service fee or in the case of our consolidation services we charge a fixed fee we also operate a limestone quarry on the land we own around our carthage missouri warehouse which contains substantial limestone deposits we do not view the operation of the quarry as an integral part of our business notes and definitions we calculate funds from operations or ffo in accordance with the standards established by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit nareit defines ffo as net income or loss determined in accordance with u s gaap excluding extraordinary items as defined under u s gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets plus specified non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effect of depreciation amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits we calculate core funds from operations or core ffo as ffo adjusted for the effects of gain or loss on the sale of non real estate assets severance and reduction in workforce costs terminated site operations costs expenses related to our review of the strategic alternatives for our company prior to the ipo litigation settlements non recurring impairment charges arising from our joint venture in china or the china jv and impairment of partially owned entities loss on debt extinguishment and modifications inventory asset impairment charges foreign currency exchange gain or loss excise tax settlement tax cuts and jobs act benefit and multi employer pension plan withdrawal expense we believe that core ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effects of certain items which can create significant earnings volatility but which do not directly relate to our core business operations we believe core ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods while also providing a more meaningful predictor of future earnings potential however because ffo and core ffo add back real estate depreciation and amortization and do not capture the level of recurring maintenance capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties both of which have material economic impacts on our results from operations we believe the utility of ffo and core ffo as a measure of our performance may be limited we calculate adjusted funds from operations or adjusted ffo as core ffo adjusted for the effects of amortization of loan costs debt discounts and above or below market leases straight line rent provision or benefit from deferred income taxes stock based compensation expense from grants of stock options and restricted stock units under our equity incentive plans non real estate depreciation depletion or amortization including in respect of the china jv and recurring maintenance capital expenditures we believe that adjusted ffo is helpful to investors as a meaningful supplemental comparative performance measure of our ability to make incremental capital investments in our business and to assess our ability to fund distribution requirements from our operating activities ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo are used by management investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity reits ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo should be evaluated along with u s gaap net income and net income per diluted share the most directly comparable u s gaap measures in evaluating our operating performance ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo do not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with u s gaap and are not indicative of our results of operations or cash flows from operating activities as disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations included in our annual and quarterly reports ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo should be considered as supplements but not alternatives to our net income or cash flows from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance moreover other reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition or may interpret the nareit definition differently than we do accordingly our ffo may not be comparable to ffo as calculated by other reits in addition there is no industry definition of core ffo or adjusted ffo and as a result other reits may also calculate core ffo or adjusted ffo or other similarly captioned metrics in a manner different than we do the table above reconciles ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo to net income which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with u s gaap we calculate ebitda for real estate or ebitdare in accordance with the standards established by the board of governors of nareit defined as earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation depletion and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change of control impairment write downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustment to reflect share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates ebitdare is a measure commonly used in our industry and we present ebitdare to enhance investor understanding of our operating performance we believe that ebitdare provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures capital investment cycles and useful life of related assets among otherwise comparable companies we also calculate our core ebitda as ebitdare further adjusted for impairment charges on intangible and long lived assets gain or loss on depreciable real property asset disposals severance and reduction in workforce costs non offering related ipo expenses loss on debt extinguishment and modification stock based compensation expense foreign currency exchange gain or loss loss on partially owned entities and reduction in ebitdare from partially owned entities we believe that the presentation of core ebitda provides a measurement of our operations that is meaningful to investors because it excludes the effects of certain items that are otherwise included in ebitdare but which we do not believe are indicative of our core business operations ebitdare and core ebitda are not measurements of financial performance under u s gaap and our ebitdare and core ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies you should not consider our ebitdare and core ebitda as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with u s gaap our calculations of ebitdare and core ebitda have limitations as analytical tools including these measures do not reflect our historical or future cash requirements for recurring maintenance capital expenditures or growth and expansion capital expenditures these measures do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs these measures do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness these measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes and although depreciation depletion and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated depleted and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements we use core ebitda and ebitdare as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity the table on page 12 reconcile ebitda ebitdare and core ebitda to net income which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with u s gaap all quarterly amounts and non gaap disclosures within this filing shall be deemed unaudited

call over to our president and ceo nish vartanian nish vartanian president and chief executive officer thank you elyse and good morning everyone the msa team delivered a strong fourth quarter and as a result capped the most successful year in our company s history not only was fourth quarter revenue a record record for us we realized growth of 7 in constant currency and that s coming off a very strong comparison from 2017 adjusted earnings of 1 27 per share was down from 1 31 a year ago but as you may recall we had a record breaking fourth quarter in 2017 in terms of revenue and earnings while we were able to generate mid single digit growth in revenue our earnings line reflects higher variable compensation that is directly tied to the stronger revenue and cash flow performance in the fourth quarter kenn will cover that in more detail however we view 1 27 of adjusted earnings per share as a very strong result for the quarter and i m proud that the team was able to generate 24 adjusted earnings growth and 13 revenue growth for the full year in 2018 our growth was nicely balanced between our fire service and industrial products in fact all core product groups posted mid single to double digit growth as a combination of new products and market focused programs continue to fuel our growth and leadership positions across our portfolio advertisement advertisement with a three year adjusted earnings cagr of more than 20 there has been a step change in our profitability profile we ve improved sg a from 28 of revenue in 2015 to 24 of revenue in 2018 we acquired and integrated latchways and globe and we ve seen a strong industrial rebound driving organic revenue growth all of which contributed to double digit earnings growth that we ve now seen for three consecutive years while kenn will provide more insight into the drivers of our quarterly and full year results i want to briefly highlight some of the other key successes in 2018 notably our new product development engine and our progress in improving profitability in our international business segment let s first look at our r d commitment where we invested 53 million in 2018 i m very pleased with the momentum of our new product development pipeline for example in 2018 we launched safety io our first subsidiary focused on using wireless technology and cloud based computing to enable a broad range of connected safety services like live monitoring and fleet management on the ppe side if you recall at investors day last year we discussed the robust npd pipeline that we had planned for fall protection in 2018 which included launching 15 new products i m pleased to say we did complete all those launches by year end we introduced a series of innovations under the v series product line including a premium racing style type harness that delivers exceptional comfort and our first to market leading edge personal fall limiter the npd pipeline and investments in sales and marketing resources and fall protection collectively supported 15 growth for the quarter and 10 growth for the year we have several new exciting launches planned in the coming weeks to continue to build out the v series fall protection line in fire service we recently launched our m1 scba for the international market in fact in the fourth quarter we delivered our first m1 order to a customer in europe and we have received additional orders from customers in spain and taiwan the common thread among all these launches is leveraging technology and innovation to provide solutions that make our customers workplaces safer and more productive and we continue to do this quite well in 2018 38 of our overall revenue was from products developed and launched in the past five years in addition to fueling the npd pipeline we re keeping a sharp focus on improving the profitability of our international segment while we did see a decline in the quarter in international operating margin due primarily to higher variable compensation costs in a very difficult prior year comparison we made good strides in 2018 and are on track with our medium and long term financial goals in this region advertisement advertisement to give you a better sense of this msa international generated a full year operating margin of nearly 12 representing a 90 basis point improvement over 2017 one of the tailwinds behind this improvement was the 10 revenue growth for the full year driven by our channels optimization program overall our total number of channel partners decreased by 16 in 2018 leading to meaningful improvements in average revenue per channel partner but more importantly our progress on the channels front supports our ability to serve our customers with a more efficient go to market strategy to wrap up the team executed very well in the fourth quarter and for all of 2018 while we typically see a backlog decline from the third quarter to the fourth quarter that was not the case this year to the contrary we saw consistent backlog levels compared to the third quarter to finish the year which remain elevated when compared to both historical levels and one year ago in a quarter where we invoice more than 360 million finishing with a high level of backlog gives you some insight into the solid momentum we continue to see in our order book with that i ll turn the call over to kenn for a financial review kenn kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer advertisement advertisement thanks nish and good morning everyone before i begin the p l review and discuss the quarter in more detail i d like to step back and provide a few key financial highlights first revenue growth was 13 for the full year or 8 in organic constant currency terms when you exclude the impact of our acquisition a year or so ago with record fourth quarter sales performance of 362 million supported by growth in all core products we exceeded the high end of a mid single digit expectation range we communicated at investor day 2018 great to see this level of growth in our business and the continued elevated level of backlog that we are carrying into 2019 profitability at both the gross and operating line remained strong annual earnings growth was over 20 again in 2018 and adjusted operating margins improved 120 basis points versus 2017 as we continue our focus on improving productivity free cash flow finished very strongly with quarterly free cash flow of over 60 million more than doubling from the same quarter a year ago despite the strong revenue growth the improvement is reflective of our ongoing focus on managing working capital for the year we reduced working capital as a percentage of sales by 220 basis points despite generating 13 revenue growth as a result 2018 marks our third consecutive year of exceeding our goal of a 100 free cash flow conversion as you compare our full year results to the long term financial expectations we communicated at our last investor day you can see that our 2018 results tracked ahead of many of the measures we discussed with you like revenue growth and cash flow generation now i d like to walk you through our fourth quarter financial results total revenue increased 7 in the quarter in constant currency with growth in nearly all core products we had a 2 fx headwind on revenue in the quarter we had a 4 headwind in the international segment as a number of currencies most notably the euro weakened versus the same quarter a year ago and a 1 headwind in the americas segment due primarily to weaker currencies in latin america advertisement advertisement we continue to see solid results in head protection portable gas detection and fall protection in the quarter we ve often talked about hard hats being a parameter for global economic conditions with that in mind it s encouraging to see revenue growth in this area in all of our operating regions to finish the year and order activity has been healthy across these areas to start the new year we had a difficult comparison in fgfd in the quarter and timing of large orders in international weighed on performance which was down 1 globally in the quarter but off 12 in the international segment our fixed gas and flame detection backlog is healthy and recent order pace has been strong quarter to date orders are up to over 10 globally to start the new year we provide some optimism heading into 2019 in the fire service area of our business we had double digit growth in scba this quarter and we continue to see ongoing benefits from the us replacement cycle and good performance in our international segment gross profit came in at just under 45 and was 40 up 40 basis points in the quarter it s good to see our leading market position supporting the improvement in margins despite the inflationary pressures in raw materials to continue offsetting rising input costs we implemented a price increase in both the americas and international segments in january and we ve tightened our special price request process globally sg a expense was 85 million in the quarter or 23 4 of sales compared to 76 million or 22 of sales a year ago the sg a increase in the quarter was primarily driven by higher levels of variable incentive compensation up about 6 million in the quarter associated with stronger financial performance in the quarter notably organic revenue growth and improvements in working capital organic revenues were up 7 over the record fourth quarter a year ago and working capital was down over 200 basis points from a year ago driven by strong improvements in the fourth quarter as i ve said before we continue to evaluate cost reduction and productivity improvement programs for our business in light of the inflationary environment that we expect to continue into 2019 along those lines we expect to make progress on our international segment footprint rationalization project in the first quarter of 2019 while these actions may drive non cash restructuring charges associated with the write off of cumulative currency translation we expect these actions to drive a more efficient business model and the steps are similar to those we took to reduce our footprint and improve our efficiency in other areas of the international segment most recently in japan advertisement advertisement gaap operating income was 42 million or 11 7 of sales in the quarter which included 20 million of other operating expense related to increasing our cumulative trauma product liability reserve the increase is mostly related to incurred but not reported or ibnr claims as we ve indicated in our filings for some time we perform a robust review of our ibnr reserve on an ongoing basis the ibnr relies on a set of facts and circumstances that we review with our actuaries and external counsel as part of that review we reflected changes in underlying assumptions in our model and recognized a charge of approximately 20 million in the fourth quarter including the increase to the reserve our total product liability reserve is 187 million at year end which is just about equal to our insurance related assets of 186 million those assets consist of receivables notes and short term investments while the timing of cash flows for product liability and insurance receivable can and do vary from quarter to quarter we ve been very successful in establishing cash flow streams that have allowed us to fund these liabilities without a material impact on our capital allocation priorities excluding foreign currency restructuring strategic transaction cost and the product liability expense i just mentioned adjusted operating margin was 18 down 40 basis points from a year ago and the higher variable compensation i mentioned a moment ago and a less favorable product mix primarily in the international segment and looking closer at the segment s adjusted operating margins showed nice improvement in the americas in the quarter up 90 basis points the improvement reflects our ability to leverage pricing programs across the segment if you recall we moved earlier in the year in 2018 on a mid year price increase in the americas and this has had a positive impact in the segment much of the margin pressure in the quarter and international came out of our middle east region on the less favorable product mix associated with a lower level of fixed gas and flame detection revenues in the region we continue to see really good traction in europe as we leverage 9 growth in the very healthy double digit earnings growth our gaap effective tax rate was about 35 for the quarter which includes discrete charges related to the adjustments associated with tax reform and extra taxes on an adjusted normalized basis our quarterly effective tax rate was just under 20 and our full year effective tax rate was 21 8 down nearly 500 basis points in 2018 due primarily to tax reform in the us in addition to driving the lower effective rate us tax reform has also provided us with the ability to repatriate foreign cash for the year we repatriated 96 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries achieving our goal of repatriating 75 million to 100 million in 2018 gaap net income was 25 million in the quarter quarterly adjusted earnings were 50 million or 1 27 per share the higher revenue gross profit and effective tax rate improvements were offset by the increase in sg a in the quarter but as nish mentioned we did expect a difficult comparison this quarter advertisement advertisement for the full year adjusted earnings were 175 million or 4 50 per share increasing 24 on the 13 increase in revenue double digit adjusted earnings growth for the third consecutive year is a reflection of the team s focus on growth while also managing the cost structure free cash flow was 62 million in the quarter compared to 29 million a year ago the current quarter includes a 11 million of net outflows from product liability compared to a prior year that reflected net outflows of 26 million underlying cash flow generation was strong with working capital finishing the year at 23 8 of revenue improving 220 basis points from the end of the third quarter despite the strong demand we saw throughout our portfolio in the fourth quarter i m very pleased to see cash conversion exceed 100 in a year where we had double digit revenue growth the team did an outstanding job managing working capital this year and we ve made great strides from a few years ago when we used to regularly trend at a rate of 70 to 80 for cash flow conversion the strong operating cash flow enabled us to pay down a 108 million of debt in 2018 and fund 57 million in dividends to our shareholders while continuing to invest in our business we remain well positioned to execute on strategic growth programs that create value debt to ebitda is 1 3 times at the end of the year compared to 2 times at year end 2017 we were able to reduce our debt while bringing on 40 million of ebitda in 2018 about a third of that profitability growth was from the globe acquisition while the remainder reflects growth and leverage in our organic business we finished the year with total bank debt of approximately 360 million with an average interest rate of 3 5 we remain very well positioned to continue to execute our strategy and to invest in our business i m pleased with the 7 revenue growth we saw in the quarter the gross profit improvements and strong free cash flow order activity and backlog remained very healthy throughout the fourth quarter and the start 2019 and that positions us well for the new year advertisement advertisement with that i ll turn the call back over to nish for some concluding commentary nish nish vartanian president and chief executive officer thanks kenn once again i m pleased with the strong performance in the quarter we had 7 revenue growth gross profit expansion of 40 basis points and earnings held up well on the difficult comparison from last year we also generated more than 100 free cash flow conversion for the quarter and for the year despite the strong top line performance this was simply great work by the team and i believe nsa remains well positioned to continue driving growth and margin expansion in 2019 thank you for your attention this morning at this time steve blanco president of the americas and bob leenen president of international have joined canada ph in a room and we ll be glad to take any questions you may have please remember that msa does not give guidance having said that we will now open up the call for your questions questions and answers operator all right great thank you operator instructions and our first question we have is from stanley elliott from stifel mr elliott please go ahead with your question stanley elliott stifel nicolaus company inc analyst thank you good morning everyone guys could you all talk about the improvements that you made on the working capital side especially with what i would have thought would been higher kind of freight transportation cost material cost et cetera and then secondly along those lines is it fair to assume that we ll see free cash flow conversion ahead of 100 again in 2019 kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hi stanley it s kenneth i ll take that question i would as i had indicated in the in the prepared commentary the team did a tremendous job at driving improvements in working capital in the fourth quarter and what was really great to see was not only the inventory improvements that we saw we saw really nice performance in inventory despite seeing some of those things you just referred to but the other thing that we saw was a really strong improvement in receivables despite seeing the uptick in revenue the focus on receivables both our current receivables as well as some of our older receivables really paid off in the us in the americas but also also over in our international segment we saw really good performance under bob leenen s leadership there as we move forward we still remain committed to driving free cash flow improvements and continuing to hold that conversion at or above 100 oftentimes it s a challenge when you are in a growth cycle like we ve seen in the last year but we ve it s been really good to see despite seeing all that growth come on us being able to leverage improvements in working capital so our focus remains the same stanley we remain committed to driving a 100 free cash flow conversion as we move forward stanley elliott stifel nicolaus company inc analyst perfect and then you guys mentioned pricing actions both internationally and domestically in january is it fair to assume that that s enough to kind of cover the cost you re maintaining a positive sort of a price cost balance going forward and then maybe what are you seeing on the inflation side on the material side and then i guess lastly the ability to look at additional pricing actions down the broad if need be nish vartanian president and chief executive officer hey stanley this is nish yes so we do have the price increase going into effect that went into effect january this year and we believe we can continue to offset anything we re seeing from a material cost standpoint the team has done a fantastic job from a pricing standpoint and in finding opportunities for price increases and then as important also on special pricing request we ve really tightened up some of the requirements and are doing a nice job with reports and monitoring our special pricing discounts and getting more sophisticated and how we manage that that side of the business so as we mentioned in 2018 we thought we could offset any inflation we saw in the material cost which we did a nice job of and we believe we can do the same here in 19 that s what requires if we see additional inflation during the year in 19 we certainly would have some sort of price adjustment mid year just as we did in north america we had that mid year price increase to offset things so we re very focused on that and we we re pretty confident we re able to execute that stanley elliott stifel nicolaus company inc analyst perfect and last from me can you guys talk about what you ve seen in the m a environment you ve done a nice job of the globe acquisition general monitors latchways it s an interesting component to the story what are you seeing out in the marketplace is it still something that you have an appetite for just any color that would be great nish vartanian president and chief executive officer sure do yes we re very active and we have a really good pipeline in place stanley realistically valuations are fairly high and as you know we ve got a good track record of buying value with general monitors latchways and globe all were accretive in the first year we d like to have a high degree of certainty about generating the right level of returns for our shareholders but i d certainly like to get one was somewhat disappointed we didn t get an acquisition in 2018 and we re very focused on that for 19 but no we re not going to chase price stanley we want to make the right move and make the right type acquisitions so we can drive that shareholder value stanley elliott stifel nicolaus company inc analyst perfect that s it from me thank you very much and congrats on a good quarter i guess a very tough comp nish vartanian president and chief executive officer thank you stanley kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you stanley operator all right and our next question we have is from richard eastman from baird mr eastman please go ahead with your question richard eastman robert w baird co analyst yes good morning to all could we just kind of spend just a second or two second on the european operating margin the kind of performance in the fourth quarter and i want to just kind of trend line that into full year discussion but just from the standpoint of the quarter was currency the currency have much of an impact on the op margin in europe and maybe you could just kind of parse out what the expectation for i ll just for international incremental might be for 19 nish vartanian president and chief executive officer so why don t i take first and then ken and bob if you guys want to chime in with some color rick the headwind for international really wasn t europe in the fourth quarter it was the middle east where a year ago fourth quarter fixed gasoline detection shipments were extremely high this year that business was soft due to two factors number one it s nature of the cycle the business the projects the projects were down this year versus last year and that s a natural cycle that we ll see in that space and then secondly one of our largest customers put a pause on purchases as they transition to the s5000 transmitter which is great news it s great news to see one of our biggest customers in the world transition to that new product the good news is is part of that elevated backlog that we have going into the first quarter we have today significant orders for s5000s for that customer and into the middle east and the project pipeline continues to build so we re fairly optimistic that the weakness we saw in the middle east will rebound here in 19 and specifically with the fixed gas and flame detection business bob do you want to add some color bob leenen vice president president msa international yes thanks nish yes it s correct we actually see a lot of activity in the market very good pipeline of opportunities and in quarter four actually in the middle east our backlog on fgfd versus the year before increased 60 so it s very encouraging to see that we had a bit of a slow period in 2018 but we structurally ph believe in the potential for the middle east market and back to the european question i ll leave the fx one to you ken europe showed in 2018 and also in q4 very solid substantial profitability improvement it was a really good first step we also know it s a longer term journey we re on with europe and we re looking at all pieces we ve grown the revenues significantly which is of course a win in our sales on the profitability as well as a significant effort by the price increases part of that we did in q4 is deploy a large amount of product and training to our commercial organization to help us with delivering the price increase in 2019 and just the productivity culture that ken refer to is something which is also front and center in europe we have some bigger tickets items we re looking at we are analyzing which are a little bit more longer term on the footprint of shared services manufacturing et cetera but also short term opportunities for productivity that were auctioning and we continue to identify more and finally our channel s optimization is the foundation behind all of this the example of inaudible we are closing is a good example of what we re able to do with the channel s optimization where in a range of countries we believe we can grow faster and be more profitable with less internal footprint and more use of channel partner so i think we re on the right track in here kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so rick you would add i believe a question on currency and kind of the incremental margin profile is that is that correct on the european business richard eastman robert w baird co analyst yes just i ramble there a little bit but i my question really was around currencies impact on the fourth quarter and then just maybe just broaden it on just the incremental margin you might expect in 19 from international and from the americas kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes so looking at currency first rick when we look at currency as i said in some of the prepared comments the euro was certainly a headwind there i think there was about a 5 headwind on revenue in the quarter and it s a consistent headwind on the earnings coming out of that segment maybe slightly smaller coming out of the european segments in terms of the earnings being translated back to the us dollar overall the incrementals are relatively healthy though you know it s hard to see the incrementals when you just look at the year over year comp because it was a challenging comp but oftentimes what i ll do is i ll look at the sequential quarter incremental margin profile and what was really nice to see with the sequential quarter in the international segment incremental margins coming in at 24 and so that was really good to see year over year is a tough comp as you know last year in the fourth quarter we did almost 15 in the international segment but we continue to see each and every quarter improvement this year and so as we head into 2019 we still think we re positioned well to drive across the business 30 incremental margin profile in our business and so it s going to come from different sources but generally the targets that we provided a year or so ago at the investor day i think are very much intact richard eastman robert w baird co analyst okay and just one last question on the head protection business just very strong all year and i m curious is that do you view that as kind of a cyclical maybe leading indicator in your business or were there some distribution gains was pricing a factor there i just really tremendous performance at a head protection throughout the year little on the fourth quarter i m just curious how that business is kind of setup as well heading into 19 nish vartanian president and chief executive officer you know it was really strong richard it s from a diversified basis all regions did really well with head protection we saw near double digit growth with every single region which is really healthy we have a very strong share in the americas and then geographically as you go around the world some areas we have better market share than others so we think we have some market share gains that we had in some international segments so the business has held up quite well and that is somewhat of a leading indicator we look at with the industrial business remember we kind of look at our business in three different segments you have the industrial quick turn products being the head protection fall protection portable gas detection and even air purifying respirator are new in that adjacent area and then the fire service typically doesn t follow that track we expect that this replacement cycle for breathing apparatus will continue on for several more years and even if there is a slow economic a little economic downturn that business should hold up pretty well and fgfd tends to be that late cycle business that comes in a little later and holds up well so if you go back to 2015 industrial recession that s where you see hard hats drops they contracted some portable gas detection contracted but the self contained breathing apparatus business for fire service that progressed quite nicely so if we have a short downturn here we might see a similar type profile as you go forward but we haven t seen that downturn yet so we re optimistic about the business richard eastman robert w baird co analyst understood great thank you operator all right and ladies and gentlemen this is your last call for any questions now is the time to ask it operator instructions and we do have another question this question is from larry de maria from william blair mr de maria please go ahead with your question larry de maria william blair analyst okay thanks good morning everybody nish vartanian president and chief executive officer good morning larry larry de maria william blair analyst good morning first clarification you just discussed tax rate expectations for 19 and also the magnitude of the price increase maybe on average across the portfolio kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer sure i ll take the tax question first larry i think we re positioned well to continue to see a very favorable tax rate here at msa i think that 23 to 24 ish kind of ranges is probably the range we d like to be in as we go through the first quarter there is a number of things we re analyzing and we ll provide more specific guidance around that for the year as we get into the first quarter but something in that range is probably not out of the realm of reason at this point from a pricing perspective i ll talk a little bit about that but also turn it over to nish i think pricing has been very strong and so as we look at our business we ve been as nish had indicated earlier in a call we were very active introducing off cycle price increase in the americas we ve continue to follow that on here earlier this year and so we re certainly positioned very strong for pricing as we head into 2019 to offset to more than offset some of the direct cost inflation that we re seeing in the business nish vartanian president and chief executive officer that s correct and so the pricing effect as of january we re looking for 1 5 to 2 net effect on that pricing that we had varies in different parts of the world so for instance in brazil we didn t have a very aggressive price increase but for most of the americas in other parts of the world we did and then again you re going to be lapping so we had the price increase for the us and canadian markets in july of last year so we ll get the additional benefit of that in the first half of this year on top of the increase they just put in place so we re very focused on that and we re not opposed to doing an off cycle price increase once again if we do continue to see inflation in the channel larry de maria william blair analyst got it that s very helpful and the 1 5 to 2 net of materials or this is the net price increase after the nominal rate when you give back some discounting kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer net price increase what we would see is net realization larry de maria william blair analyst got you now in terms of the international footprint rationalization i think like we re doing a lot more on efficiencies shared services things like this is there any appetite to do anything or maybe there is going on right now more structural rationalization maybe closing facilities and things like this at this point kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes we are we re certainly looking at that larry we ve we re taking a hard look at shared services model for europe that s where we ve really driven a lot of efficiencies in north america and south america and so we re taking a hard look at that opportunity so that s longer term that s why we this is a four five year journey that will be on with the international segment there are some things that we are able to do short term and realize some benefits in 2018 we think that ll continue in 19 but we re also looking at some more structural type activities that will probably take place over the next 12 to 18 months that ll sustain that profit improvement as we go forward and that s certainly one area we re taking a hard look at nish vartanian president and chief executive officer something that we ve said consistently larry is that we have opportunities up and down the p l and so we have manufacturing opportunities we continue to look at sourcing opportunities we continue to look at but we also have sg a opportunities that we re very much auctioning and so there is a tremendous amount of opportunities it s good to see margins in international go from sub 10 just two short years ago to now just about 12 in a really short period of time but we also continue to see more and more opportunities ahead of us to continue to improve that margin and the underlying profitability larry de maria william blair analyst okay thank you and then last question from me i would say your backlog seems healthy as you mentioned sequentially i guess flattish if you think about 19 how is the market being driven more by upgrades and replacement or is it driven by the economic growth in projects and how broad based we expect that strength to flow through your various business lines thank you nish vartanian president and chief executive officer yes i don t think it s necessarily upgrades i think it s a normal business flow we re seeing some real good gains across our product portfolio especially with the new product launches that we ve had so we think we re gaining a little bit share wise you know the growth the organic growth of 8 i think supports that thought and really the new products have done a nice job in strengthening our position in many of the markets whether it s the 5 000 series transmitter what we ve done with fall protection with the 15 products we ve launched what s really interesting is that some people talked of the slowdown as they went into the fourth quarter our fall protection business built we had some real strength in the fourth quarter and i think that was on the back of the new product launches that we had and that will continue into the first quarter of this year so we re pretty optimistic about our position in the market and what we can do going forward larry de maria william blair analyst okay thanks very much good luck nish vartanian president and chief executive officer thank you kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you larry elyse lorenzato director investor relations all right and it looks like our final question is from edward marshall from sidoti company mr marshall please go ahead with your question edward marshall sidoti company analyst hey g guys good morning how are you nish vartanian president and chief executive officer good good morning ed edward marshall sidoti company analyst so you just mentioned that there are levers several levers for margins sourcing manufacturing even even mix i guess can you walk about maybe what the biggest swing factor could be in margin which which of these might have the biggest impact for msa nish vartanian president and chief executive officer sure ed what we ve consistently said is we are not dependent upon one specific factor we ve got factors that avail themselves to us across the p l but the thing that s really nice to see in the work that bob is leading in international is around our channels optimization and our ability to access the customer in a much more efficient manner than we historically had so that s it s really good to see the progress we re making there but as we go forward we re looking at all of those opportunities across the p l to continue to build on this incremental margin profile that we re seeing at around 24 here in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and so we continue to look at that i ll turn it over to bob if you want to add any color there as well bob leenen vice president president msa international yes i think some of these are bigger ticket items shared services or the manufacturing footprint i think they are larger analysis that we re undertaking right now and we also especially in europe have works council process that we need to go through so we really can t talk much about that right now we have to kind of follow those process inaudible i m sure in due course we will provide more color on that edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and i think from past discussions the channel optimization was significant characteristic between the difference between what you ve seen in north america versus what international is doing i m curious maybe if you could talk baseball terms for a second maybe could you talk about what inning you think you are in the channel optimization go to market strategy with the international segment nish vartanian president and chief executive officer yes we re early in that i mean certainly third inning it s we re very much on the front end the team has really done a nice job there under some leadership the person leading that effort he was the person when i was the director of sales for north america he was the channels manager who really developed our model in north america and dave is now leading the european and international team when it comes to channels and it s been a really nice job with that team and working our way in some channels of distribution we just didn t have relationships with so we re building those relationships we re seeing some nice progress with our position within those distributors and we re building that position so we re in the early stages of that and we think that we can really gain some leverage if we execute effectively over the next several years edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and the product liability reserves i just had a few questions on that i m curious just talk about maybe the pace that you ve seen here is this kind of been consistent with what you would anticipate and also what might be driving what drives the i know there was about 1 500 lawsuits in the end of september so is that new lawsuits that drives the p l impact or is it kind of closer to decisions in the existing lawsuits that would necessarily drive that that increase in the reserve for the p l nish vartanian president and chief executive officer yes so to address your first question we feel that the product liability exposures are very well managed we continue to manage them we continue to deploy a multifaceted approach to addressing product liability and we feel like we re positioned very well to continue to manage our exposures on that front albeit it is a very uncertain area and it s an area that can change quite quickly and so we continue to keep a really close watch on that area what was really good for us to see in 2018 was all the success we had on the insurance front securing cash flow streams to help manage the liability exposure in the mitigate the impact on our cash flow performance and when we look at the overall claims experience we feel like again we re positioned well claims are certainly one of a number of things that we continue to look at and the number of claims coming in the number of the average settlement values and a number of different things that we continue the way as we look at this liability but in summary we feel like we re positioned it s a very uncertain area but we re positioned well and we ve continued to manage this area quite nicely over the last several years edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and the treatment of increases from here would it be consistent with the way you ve treated and it would this be i mean now that the insurance receivable essentially is exhausted with the current reserve how do you think about how do we think about kind of the is that i guess that s a cash use from msa at this point or are there additional insurance receivables out there and lawsuits that you re kind of pursuing thanks nish vartanian president and chief executive officer so when we look at the treatment it s the change in the ibnr was purely a non cash impact for msa it was a change in estimates and we accounted for it as such we adjusted it out of our current earnings it s entirely it is a non cash charge and it s entirely related to legacy products that we manufactured and sold decades ago and so it s not current of our it s not part of our current operations we feel like that we re positioned well as i said earlier to continue to manage through this uncertainty we still do look at our insurance profile and our insurance coverage and we still do identify opportunities to pursue additional coverages but as we have disclosed the substantial portion of our insurance assets have been secured and we ve disclosed that as such in our public filings edward marshall sidoti company analyst great thanks very much guys nish vartanian president and chief executive officer thank you operator all right great thank you and it looks like we have no further questions so i will turn it back to you elyse for final comments elyse lorenzato director investor relations thank you kelly seeing that we have no more questions that will conclude today s call if you missed a portion of the call an audio replay and transcript will be available on our investor relations website for the

quarter 2017 a 4 decrease natural gas production decreased 18 while oil and condensate and ngl production increased 10 and 4 respectively fourth quarter 2018 equivalent production was negatively impacted by decreased oil production in the williston basin decreased gas production due to lack of new activity in the haynesville cotton valley and the uinta basin divestiture in september 2018 which contributed 3 9 bcf in the fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses during the fourth quarter 2018 lease operating expense loe was 59 5 million or 5 11 per boe a decrease of 25 compared with the

million or 3 31 per boe a decrease of 10 compared with the fourth quarter 2017 primarily due to the uinta basin divestiture combined with a decrease in haynesville cotton valley from lower gas production these decreases were partially offset by increases in the permian basin due to higher gas recovery during the fourth quarter 2018 general and administrative expense g a was 57 5 million or 4 95 per boe an increase of 27 compared with the fourth quarter 2017 the increase in total g a expense in the fourth quarter 2018 was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the implementation of our 2018 strategic initiatives the increase was partially offset by a decrease in share based compensation and in the mark to market value of the deferred compensation wrap plan and a decrease in outside services during the fourth quarter 2018 production and property taxes were 26 9 million or 2 31 per boe a decrease of 5 compared with the fourth quarter 2017 the decrease in production and property taxes was primarily due to decreased revenues in the williston and uinta basins and production tax exemptions in haynesville cotton valley partially offset by increased revenues in the permian basin capital investment total capital investment was 205 7 million on an accrual basis for the fourth quarter 2018 compared with 1 056 3 million for the fourth quarter 2017 total capital investment for the year ended december 31 2018 on an accrual basis was 1 242 2 million down 792 8 million compared with the year ended december 31 2017 due to the acquisition of oil and gas properties in the permian basin the 2017 permian basin acquisition in the fourth quarter 2017 capital investment excluding property acquisitions was 188 4 million on an accrual basis for the fourth quarter 2018 compared with 372 2 million for the fourth quarter 2017 of which 170 7 million related to the drilling completion and equipping of wells and 16 8 million was related to infrastructure investment the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to decreased drilling and completion activity in the permian basin and limited activity in the williston basin and haynesville cotton valley in the fourth quarter 2018 capital investment excluding property acquisitions was 1 176 6 million on an accrual basis for the year ended december 31 2018 compared with 1 219 8 million for the year ended december 31 2017 of which 1 089 3 million related to the drilling completion and equipping of wells and 83 0 million was related to infrastructure investment the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to decreased drilling and completion activity in the williston basin and reduced well refracturing activity in the haynesville cotton valley partially offset by increased drilling and completion activity in the permian basin during the year ended december 31 2018 qep acquired various oil and gas properties which primarily included proved and

officer hey thanks tad hopefully you ve had a chance to review our earnings press release our earnings press release includes a number of historical metrics reported on a consistent basis now for a few words about expectations against long term guidance targets our corporate business which represents approximately two thirds of our revenue for full year 2018 has been growing within our targeted guidance range for long term revenue growth of between 10 and 20 and in fact it grew at 11 8 full year 2018 over full year 2017 however our netcentric business has been underperforming and until that business recovers historical long term growth rates we are revising our long term full year revenue growth target to 10 our long term ebitda annual margin expansion targeted guidance is an annual improvement of approximately 200 basis points for full year 2018 we exceeded our ebitda margin annual targeted guidance growth and we achieved annual ebitda margin expansion of 230 basis points our cash flow as defined by ebitda minus capex minus principal payments on our capital leases grew by 19 2 full year 2018 over full year 2017 due to the excellent operating leverage in our business we expect this rate of cash flow growth to continue at similar rates in the future our revenue and ebitda guidance targets are intended to be multi year goals and are not meant to be used as specific quarterly or annual guidance tad will now cover some additional details relating to the results for our quarter and full year tad weed chief financial officer thanks again dave and again good morning to everyone i d also like to thank and congratulate our entire cogent team for their results and continued hard work and efforts during another very busy and very productive quarter and year for cogent some comments on revenue by corporate and netcentric and customer connections we analyze our revenues based upon network type which is on net off net and non core and we also analyze our revenues based upon customer type and we classify all of our customers into two types netcentric customers and corporate customers our netcentric customers buy large amounts of bandwidth from us in carrier neutral data centers and our corporate customers buy bandwidth from us in large multi tenant office buildings revenue from our corporate customers for the quarter grew sequentially by 2 8 to 87 9 million and grew year over year by 11 7 for the quarter revenue for our corporate customers was 337 8 million for the full year which was an increase as dave mentioned of 11 8 over full year 2017 we had 45 189 corporate customer connections on our network at quarter end which represented an increase of 18 9 over 2017 quarterly revenue from our netcentric customers declined sequentially by 1 to 44 1 million and declined year over year by 5 1 for the quarter revenue from our netcentric customers was 182 3 million for full year 2018 which was a decrease of 0 4 over full year 2017 we had 34 917 netcentric customer connections on our network at quarter end which was an increase of 3 9 over full year 2017 our netcentric revenue growth experiences significant more volatility than our corporate revenues due to the impact of foreign exchange the size of those customers and other certain seasonal factors comments on revenue and customer connections by network type our on net revenue was 95 4 million for the quarter that was a sequential increase of 1 7 and a year over year increase of 6 7 our on net revenue was 374 6 million for full year 2018 which was an increase of 8 1 over full year 2017 our on net customer connections increased by 2 1 sequentially and increased by 12 1 year over year we ended the quarter and year with 68 770 on net customer connections on our network in our 2 676 total on net multi tenant office buildings and carrier neutral data center buildings our off net revenue was 36 6 million for the quarter which was a sequential quarterly increase of 1 and a year over year increase of 2 5 our off net revenue was 145 million for full year 2018 which was an increase of 5 2 over 2017 our off net customer connections increased sequentially by 2 6 and increased by 10 3 year over year we ended the quarter and year serving 10 974 off net customer connections and over 6 650 off net buildings and these buildings are primarily in north america some comments on pricing consistent with historical trends the average price per megabit of our installed base decreased for the quarter however the average price per megabit for our new customer contracts were stable the average price per megabit for our installed base declined sequentially by 7 1 to 0 73 and declined by 26 4 from the fourth quarter of 2017 the average price per megabit for our new contracts for the quarter was flat sequentially and also flat year over year at 0 42 for all periods some comments on arpu our on net and off net arpu both decreased sequentially for the quarter our on net arpu which includes both corporate and netcentric customers was 467 for the quarter which was a decrease of 0 8 from last quarter our off net arpu which is comprised predominantly of corporate customers was 1 124 for the quarter and that was a decrease of 1 3 comments on churn our on net unit churn rate was stable and our off net unit churn rate improved during the quarter our on net unit churn rate was 1 for the quarter which was the same rate as last quarter our off net unit churn rate was also 1 and that was an improvement from 1 2 from last quarter some comments on move out change orders for netcentric customers we offer discounts related to contract term to all of our corporate and netcentric customers we also offer volume commitment discounts to our netcentric customers during this quarter certain netcentric customers took advantage of our volume and contract term discounts and entered into long term contracts for over 2 800 customer connections and that increased their revenue commitment to cogent by over 22 2 million so more details on ebitda and ebitda as adjusted our ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are reconciled to our cash flow from operations in all of our quarterly earnings press releases seasonal factors that typically impact our sg a expenses and consequently our ebitda and ebitda as adjusted include the resetting of payroll taxes at the united states at the beginning of each year annual cost of living or cpi increases the timing and level of our audit and tax services net neutrality fees and the timing and amount of our gains on equipment transactions and our annual sales meeting costs which typically occur in january and benefit plan annual cost increases our quarterly ebitda increased by 643 000 or by 1 4 sequentially to 47 6 million and increased year over year by 4 3 million or by 10 our ebitda increased by 23 2 million or by 14 4 for full year 2018 over 2017 our quarterly ebitda margin decreased 10 basis points sequentially to 36 and increased quarterly year over year by 150 basis points our full year 2018 ebitda margin increased by 230 basis points over 2017 and again as dave mentioned this 2018 ebitda margin percentage of 35 5 represents the largest annual ebitda margin percentage in our history our ebitda as adjusted includes gains on our equipment transactions and our equipment gains have recently been declining and were only 92 000 for the quarter down from 319 000 from the fourth quarter of last year and 416 000 from last quarter our equipment gains were 1 million for 2018 as compared to 3 9 million for last year our quarterly ebitda as adjusted increased by 319 000 or by 0 7 sequentially to 47 7 million and increased year over year by 4 1 million which was 9 4 our ebitda as adjusted increased by 20 4 million or by 12 3 for the full year and our quarterly ebitda as adjusted margin decreased sequentially by 30 basis points to 36 1 and increased by 130 basis points year over year some comments on earnings per share our basic and diluted income per share was 0 16 for the quarter compared to 0 18 last quarter and a loss per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 0 14 as a reminder the signing of the tax cuts and job act in december of 2017 reduced the corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35 to a flat 21 rate and resulted in an increase of our non cash deferred income tax expense by about 11 3 million in the fourth quarter of last year and also the full year of 2017 under us gaap because of the reduction in the income tax rate our net deferred tax asset was revalued in the fourth quarter of 2017 using the lower income tax rate the income tax rate change impact represented about 0 25 of a loss per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter of last year and full year 2017 some comments on foreign currency impact our revenues reported in us dollars and earned outside of the united states represented about 22 of our total revenues about 17 of our revenues this quarter were based in europe and about 5 of our revenues were related to our canadian mexican asia pacific and latin american operations continued volatility in foreign exchange rates can materially impact our quarterly revenue results and our overall financial results the foreign exchange impact on our reported quarterly sequential revenue was a negative 0 5 million and the year over year foreign exchange impact on our reported quarterly revenue was a negative 0 9 million for full year 2018 the impact was a positive 4 million our quarterly revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis were 1 8 sequentially 6 2 year over year and 6 4 for full year 2018 over full year 2017 the impact of foreign exchange primarily impacts our netcentric revenues the average euro to us dollar rate so far this quarter is 1 14 and the average canadian dollar exchange rate is 0 75 should these average foreign exchange rates remain at the current average levels for the remainder of this quarter the first quarter of 2019 we estimate that the fx conversion impact on our sequentially quarterly revenues for this quarter will not be material however the year over year conversion impact on quarterly revenues is estimated to be material and to be a negative 1 9 million customer concentration we believe that our revenue and customer base is not highly concentrated and our top 25 customers represented less than 6 of our revenues this quarter comments on capex our capital expenditures for the quarter declined sequentially by 9 7 our capital expenditures were 10 9 million this quarter compared to 10 6 million for the fourth quarter of last year and 12 1 million for the third quarter of 2018 our capital expenditures were 49 9 million for the full year as compared to 45 8 million for 2017 capital lease and capital lease payments our capital lease iru obligations are for long term dark fiber leases and typically have initial terms of 15 to 20 years or longer and often include multiple renewal options after the initial term our capital lease iru fiber lease obligations totaled 163 8 million at year end and at quarter end and year end we had iru contracts with a total of 239 different dark fiber suppliers our capital lease principal payments under these iru agreements were 2 1 million for the quarter and if you combine these payments with our capex there was a decrease sequentially by 8 and that total was 13 1 million this quarter compared to 14 2 million for the third quarter and 12 5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 capital lease payments combined with capex were 60 2 million this year compared to 57 million last year we added 37 more buildings to our network in 2018 than we added in 2017 and that is 28 an addition of 28 more on net buildings this year cash and operating cash flow at year end our cash and cash equivalents totaled 276 1 million for the quarter our cash decreased by 8 5 million we returned 38 4 million of capital to our stakeholders this quarter during the quarter we paid 26 5 million for our dividend 5 3 million was spent on a semiannual interest payment on our debt and we bought stock this quarter totaling 6 6 million our quarterly operating cash flow increased sequentially by 28 3 to 40 7 million and increased by 29 9 year over year this operating cash flow of over 40 million this quarter was the greatest quarterly operating cash flow in our 19 year history and our operating cash flow was 133 9 million for the year which was an increase of almost 20 over last year our total gross debt at par including capital leases was 809 2 million at year end and our net debt was 533 2 million our total gross debt to trailing last 12 months ebitda as adjusted ratio was 4 36 at year end and our net debt ratio was 2 87 finally some comments on bad debt and day sales and accounts receivable our bad debt expense was again only 0 7 of our revenues for the quarter and only 0 6 of our revenue for the year and that total amount was down 300 000 year over year for the year our days sales outstanding for worldwide accounts receivable was only 25 days that was the same amount as the end of last year and i want to again thank and recognize our worldwide billing and collections team members for continuing to just do a fantastic job in serving our customers and collecting from our customers and with that i will turn the call back over to dave dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer hey thanks tad i d like to take a moment and comment on the scale and scope of our network and its expansion we have over 944 million square feet of multi tenant office space in north america directly on our network we added 170 buildings to our network in 2018 our network consists of 32 900 metro fiber miles and over 57 400 intercity route miles of fiber the cogent network remains the most interconnected network in the world and we have direct connectivity with over 6 580 networks which less than 30 of these networks are settlement free peers the remaining networks are all cogent transit customers we are currently utilizing approximately 31 of the lit capacity in our network we routinely augment segments of the network to maintain these low utilization rates for the quarter we achieved sequential traffic growth of 10 and on a year over year basis our traffic grew by 44 in the quarter we operate 52 of our own data centers which comprise 587 000 feet of raised floor space and are today operating at approximately 32 utilization our sales force turnover was approximately 5 in the quarter which is better than our long term sales force turnover rate of monthly 5 7 our quarterly sales rep productivity as measured on a monthly basis per full time equivalent was 5 7 installed orders per rep per month this is above our long term average of 5 1 orders installed per full time equivalent rep per month we ended the quarter with 487 sales reps selling our services which is a significant increase from the 453 reps that we had at the end of q3 and the most number of sales reps selling our services we ve had in our corporate history in summary cogent is a low cost provider of internet services transit services and our value proposition remains unmatched in the industry our business remains completely focused on the internet ip connectivity and data center colocation all of which are necessary utilities to our customers beginning in april 1 of 2018 we began also selling sd wan services which thus far has not been a material contributor to our revenues but we do expect to continue to grow our multi year constant currency long term revenue growth target is approximately 10 due to the slowdown in our netcentric business and our long term ebitda margin expansion rate is expected to be approximately 200 basis points per year our board of directors has approved yet another increase to our quarterly dividend of 0 02 per share bringing that quarterly dividend to 0 58 per share per quarter our dividend increases demonstrate the continued optimism regarding the cash flow generating capabilities of our business we will be opportunistic about the timing of purchase of our common stock during the quarter we purchased 148 000 shares of our common stock for 6 6 million at an average price per share of 44 36 at the end of the quarter we still have 34 9 million remaining under our current authorized buyback program we are committed to returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders on a regular basis with that i d like to open it up for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from colby synesael of cowen and company your line is open unidentified participant analyst great thanks for taking the questions this is john ph on for colby how much has your view on the long term growth potential for the netcentric business changed since last quarter especially given the tweak to your growth targets of 10 now and how should we be thinking about the growth or trends within that business over the next couple of quarters thank you dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer yeah so i think our long term view is the netcentric business will continue to improve and return to its long term average growth rate of about 9 5 year over year as i mentioned in the last call and have repeated at multiple interactions with investors that business has continued to underperform for a number of reasons while traffic growth has accelerated revenue growth has lagged on a full year basis revenues were down four tenths of a percent if you fx adjust that they were up 2 6 2018 over 2017 which is a substantially lower growth rate than the 9 5 long term average based on the slower rate of recovery in that business it made sense for us to revise our long term growth rate to be realistic about the amount of time it s going to take for that business to recover but our ultimate view is traffic growth will continue to accelerate price declines will be at historic full the average rates about 23 per year and cogent will continue to gain market share growing about twice as fast as the market so with those parameters we do expect to eventually return to netcentric growth in that 9 to 10 range and therefore our total growth rate will be back in the 10 to 20 range but due to the fact that we do not have visibility to when that will occur it seemed prudent to reduce the total business revenue growth target to 10 which is still substantially better than any other wireline telecom service provider who is growing organically globally unidentified participant analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from matthew niknam with deutsche bank your line is open unidentified participant analyst hey guys this is actually benjamin ph on for matt thanks for taking the question just one quick one on the sales force so you guys noted that there was lower churn this quarter and we also saw sort of the highest net additions there that we have in a while just wanted to dig in there and see if there s anything to call out around is this lower churn a trend has your strategy changed around how many people you want to add just anything there thanks dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer yeah so we remain pleased with the initiatives that we ve put in place and continue to enhance on the sales force as we ve spoken about with investors in the past we have implemented a much more formalized and rigorous training program that has allowed us to reduce churn we have experienced lower sales force turnover over the last several quarters and continue to see the ability to improve that number even further in terms of total number of sales people we expect to grow the sales force somewhere between 7 and 10 annually we achieved that 17 over 18 and we expect similar type aggregate growth in the sales force in 2019 versus 2018 to help facilitate that we continue to open additional sales offices recently we opened offices in columbus ohio singapore and in montreal to augment the footprint that we have in place and then finally we think that the training efforts that we have put in place have been responsible for enhanced sales force productivity and our rep productivity at 5 7 orders per full time equivalent rep per month installed continues to be substantially above our long term average so it is this improvement in both the size of the sales force and the efficiency of the sales force that gives us confidence that our aggregate business will continue to grow and our operating margins will continue to improve and therefore our ability to grow cash flow at nearly 20 and therefore grow the dividend at a similar rate unidentified participant analyst great thanks operator our next question comes from frank louthan with raymond james your line is open frank louthan raymond james analyst yeah can you just give us an update on the sales force progression in the netcentric business where do you expect that expect that to be over the next 12 months and is there anything changed in sort of your hiring and so forth with how you ve already done that organization dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer yes hey frank so today we have 141 of our 487 reps are netcentric they are effectively equally divided between north america and the rest of the world we continue to expect to grow both the corporate and netcentric sales forces at about the same rate the opening of the office in singapore is focused purely on the netcentric market whereas the columbus office is mostly focused on the retail market with limited netcentric opportunities in that part of the country we continue to enhance the training of both sales organizations and we feel comfortable that over the long run the netcentric business will improve from that 2 6 year over year growth back to the 9 5 we just don t know exactly when that s going to happen so that was the reason for the slightly more conservative guidance targets going forward but we think we have the right number of netcentric reps their turnover is substantially lower than that of the corporate reps and we expect their productivity continue to remain at elevated levels just as we re seeing from the entire sales force frank louthan raymond james analyst so what is sort of the trick then to get it back up you tweaked around a little bit with sort of their focus or is it focusing more on web scale providers and things like that what exactly do you think will it s going to take to get that growth rate back up it s a pretty big jump dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer sure so a couple of points frank first of all the unit growth has already reaccelerated the traffic growth numbers have reaccelerated what we have seen however is over the past year most of that unit growth has come from our largest customers which get the lowest price point it has been that lower priced traffic that has retarded our revenue growth rate we believe that is a temporary phenomena for two reasons one some of our netcentric customers who previously had paid direct connect agreements that they were pressured into in the period of constrained ports when there were violations of net neutrality are now able to divert their traffic back to cogent and utilize transit as a lower cost and easier to use service secondly we have seen organic growth rates of the larger web centric customers hyperscale providers outpace that of the general market i think that is a more transitory phenomena and we would expect that over the next year or two the market growth rates of both large and small customers to homogenize and become equivalent whereas today we are seeing a disproportionate growth from our largest customers so there s actually nothing wrong with the netcentric sales efficiency and efficacy the issue is they re actually selling to big customers which is depressing the effective price per megabit and we think that s a temporary phenomenon frank louthan raymond james analyst okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from nick del deo with moffettnathanson your line is open nicholas ralph del deo moffettnathanson llc analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my questions first dave as you noted in your prepared remarks you had really strong margin expansion in 2018 even despite revenue growth coming in a bit shy of your goals that seemed to be mostly driven by sg a controls even though sg a leverage in q4 was a bit lower than the first three quarters of the year were there any sg a drivers that made an outsized contribution to margin expansion during the year or other drivers that we should bear in mind as we think about 2019 dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer so first of all nick roughly 100 basis points of our margin expansion came from cogs efficiency as our cost of goods sold continued to decline as a percentage of revenues our gross margins increased from 57 to 58 we have said that over the long term that roughly 200 basis points per year of margin expansion will come almost equally from cogs efficiency and sg a efficiency on the sg a part of your question we are getting more efficacy out of the sales force we are getting better utilization of our sales infrastructure as the sales force grows the management spend sort of control are filling out and we are not adding significantly to our g a headcount it is really all of those things that have attributed to the sg a operating leverage in the business so on the network side it s the sale of on net services and the high operating leverage that comes from that the lower operating leverage but still substantial that comes from selling off net and then on the sg a side it s really just utilizing our infrastructure more efficiently if we look over the long term cogent s ebitda contribution margins have been 43 7 that is actually still substantially above the 35 5 that we delivered for full year 2018 but we are also seeing our contribution margins improve and in fact for 2018 our contribution margins were about 58 which is substantially above that long term average we actually expect that to continue and it is why even though we revised our target for total revenue growth due to the slower revenue growth on the netcentric portion of the business we remain confident in our ability in 2019 to deliver approximately 200 basis points of ebitda margin expansion and we actually expect that to continue in the out years as well again this is not short term guidance but long term nicholas ralph del deo moffettnathanson llc analyst got it that s great color and then maybe can you give us any sort of update on your sd wan offering in terms of client interest and your sales funnel maybe highlight anything unexpected or interesting you ve learned from a marketing or operating perspective since you launched it dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer yeah so i said there are really three takeaways from our launch the customers that have deployed have been happy with the service two i think a lot of prospective customers are confused about what the technology actually can deliver and where it is superior to our vpls offering so i would actually say that one of the big advantages of offering sd wan has actually been the commencement of conversations with mpls customers who want to switch off of mpls and as they evaluate the two technologies some of those customers have actually chosen vpls over sd wan some have chosen sd wan and i think universally what our sales force is saying is any customer that today is operating an mpls network is frustrated they are frustrated with the high cost the lack of flexibility and the difficulty of managing that network over the long term so there are about 1 3 million mpls ports deployed in north america and that represents close to 45 billion in spend we think that all of that is vulnerable to replacement and will be migrating to sd wan or to vpls i think the third point i d like to make is customers remain confused about what sd wan can deliver versus some of the promises that have been made by some of the equipment vendors and there are a multitude of vendors in the market selling cpe equipment and they make a number of promises or boasts about their equipment that are probably not completely accurate and a big part of the sales effort has actually been our sales force managing customer expectations and those expectations really are around throughput and feature set and it s a trade off if you turn all of the feature sets on in terms of security control and multi vendor interfaces you then end up sacrificing throughput if you re focused on throughput in many ways a vpls solution is more mature but we re seeing success with both products and our vpns delivered over both technologies continue to increase as a percentage of our revenues and have grown from 17 to 18 of total revenues and are up from 25 to about 27 of corporate revenues nicholas ralph del deo moffettnathanson llc analyst got it that s great color dave thanks so much dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer hey thanks nick operator thank you and i m not showing any further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to mr schaeffer for any closing remarks dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer okay well first of all i d like to thank everyone for joining us i know today is a busy day and there are some other investor events going on but we remain pleased with our performance we are encouraged by the cash flow generation that our business is continuing to demonstrate in a market where other wireline carriers have been struggling and our commitment to returning increasing amounts of cash to our shareholders has been demonstrated by both our buyback and dividend increase strategy so i want to thank everyone i want to thank the entire cogent team and we ll be talking soon operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today s conference this does conclude

president trump increasingly is showing a strong winning political hand but shouldn t we be alarmed about runaway national debt and the mushrooming deficit following the state of the union speech trump s poll ratings hit a record 52 despite intense daily attacks and smears from the anti trump media and democrats trump s list of accomplishments in just two years can only be described as historic more americans are working than ever before in history jobs are at record highs for blacks hispanics and women manufacturing confidence at an all time high trump has replaced nafta and is negotiating the trade imbalances with china and europe tariffs that trump imposed a year ago on steel aluminum solar panels and washing machines have already created 11 000 new jobs job openings reached a record high of 7 3 million in december president trump has triggered a true middle class revival while obama previously shrugged his shoulders and lamented that middle calls manufacturing jobs were gone forever trump recently signed a first step act criminal justice reform into law and he continues to battle for the wall despite full blown resistance from leading democrats who all previously supported the idea of secure borders his declaration of a national emergency to get the wall built has drawn the predictable amount of criticism and resistance but it underscores trump s determination to fulfill a central campaign promise it now seems that the mueller russia collusion investigation is blowing up in the democrats faces just in time for the kickoff of the 2020 election season this comes with shocking new revelations of fbi deep state efforts to remove president trump from office including a 60 minutes interview with disgraced and fired fbi deputy director andrew mccabe meanwhile racist marxist muslim gender obsessed anti semitic radicals have hijacked the democrat party trump s potential 2020 challengers all appear to be seriously flawed some believe kamala harris used the hollywood casting couch method to get into politics fake indian elizabeth warren has been exposed as an outright fraud hillary is pretty much finished as her husband bill slinks into obscurity in an era of metoo serial child groper joe biden is not only old hat but he s a white male an anathema to much of the democrat party beto o rourke s latest rally was drowned out by trump rally music a non partisan watchdog group is seeking an ethics investigation of kirsten gillibrand vegan cory spartacus booker now claims the planet can t sustain people eating meat little michael bloomberg may spend some of his billions but he has no appeal to voters over the hill socialist bernie sanders is just that over the hill and not credible amy klobuchar ranted against global warming as she announced her candidacy in a blizzard that almost obscured her and speaking of farce there s congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez s green new deal that features democrats trying to explain the benefit of ending air travel and building railroads across oceans clearly the political tide is now running in trump s favor but what about the deficit are we headed for fiscal disaster while no one is watching we conservatives beat that drum hard against obama and hillary trump was assumed by some to be a fiscal conservative who would make that an issue and fix the problem but with all the other issues staring at us the multiple threats of open borders the disaster of our leftist controlled education system the threat from islam the multiple level threats from china the tragedy of identity politics that has ripped open our society and threatens to destroy it our slide toward socialism the ongoing assault on trump and his presidency by a badly corrupted deep state and the new morality of left wing america that condones chopping up baby parts for profit the issue has slipped pretty far down on any list of concerns and priorities we rarely hear about it now even as the deficit continues to balloon the national debt is now 22 trillion and climbing at a rate of 1 trillion a year michael peterson ceo of the peter g peterson foundation says as we borrow trillion after trillion interest costs will weigh on our economy and make it harder to fund important investments in our future we already pay an average of 1 billion a day in interest on the debt and will spend a staggering 7 trillion in interest costs over the next decade the congressional budget office projects the budget deficit for the current fiscal year will be nearly 900 billion at his rose garden declaration of a national emergency to build a border wall along the mexican border president trump said the u s will grow its way out of the 22 trillion national debt rather than by cutting government spending or raising taxes it s all about growth said trump growth will straighten it out in fact the federal government collected a record 1 665 484 000 000 in individual income taxes in calendar year 2018 total us government revenue is estimated to be 3 422 trillion for fiscal year 2019 but despite these all time record government revenues there is scant evidence of how effective trump s plan will be the problem is the same as it s always been government spending to a large degree both parties are to blame all politicians are drunk on spending members of congress are rated by their constituents on how much federal money they bring back into their districts from washington in the early 1960 s my former government professor at cornell ted lowi defined democrat strategy as spend spend spend elect elect elect in fact all of the political class is indebted to spending as a way of staying in office and retaining power and despite the rising debt tide inflation remains under control the stock market is strong americans have never been more prosperous spending is largely broken into two categories which even record high government revenues can t keep up with some programs are on auto pay such as medicare and social security other programs that are in the category of discretionary spending include non medicare healthcare spending the military housing welfare intelligence and transportation federal student loan programs and mortgage programs are major factors spending for illegals is in the billions it s one of the reasons the wall is so important there is also plenty of old fashioned pork as well as leftist supported programs including planned parenthood npr funding for the arts and other programs the government has no business being involved with a major unsettling issue in failing to address the nation s borrowing is that it weakens the united states while strengthening china the largest foreign holder of u s debt china held 12 1 percent of public debt at the end of february 2018 so if the 2011 estimates hold and china holds the same proportion of debt throughout the year it receives about 74 4 million per day a major contribution to its military budget president trump told his cabinet advisers late last year to seek a 5 percent reduction in their budgets that would possibly reduce the deficit by about 70 billion a small slice of 900 billion a good friend of mine who is a former dow jones financial reporter argues that tax cuts stimulate the economy and help somewhat in paying the ensuing larger deficit down likewise he argues deficit spending stimulates the economy and helps somewhat in paying down the ensuing deficits as long as that deficit spending is investment focused as opposed to purely consumption focused generally trump has been indifferent to deficit issues three years ago candidate trump suggested the united states could borrow money to shore up the economy and simply ask for discounts on the debt later he later said he was referring to buying back existing debt at a discount if interest rates went higher lowering the nominal value this is something the government already does but trump also was quoted as saying this is the united states government you never have to default because you print the money so are we facing a pending fiscal disaster in the 1980s when the federal deficit was much smaller than it is today chairman of the federal reserve paul volcker repeatedly told congress the deficits were going to come back and bite you he couldn t say just when of course and arguably 30 or so years later they never have a big reason is because the u s remains the world s reserve currency country it is far easier for us to finance our deficits than is the case for other countries a mixed blessing you might argue this has enabled us to live beyond our means and to keep the issue away from the attention of voters can trump s revenue growth strategy reduce the deficit only if progress is made in cutting spending rates frankly it s easier to believe congress will keep spending because it s the best way for members to get re elected and despite economists threats of fiscal doom the economy is thriving as never before volcker s 35 year old question remains when will the deficit come back to bite us graphic credit cafecredit frank hawkins is a former u s army intelligence officer associated

same prior year period net cash from operating activities for 2018 was 191 1 million down 104 2 million from the prior year the decrease was primarily due to changes in movements in non cash working capital items and non current ore stockpiles 98 6 million and lower earnings after non cash adjustments 26 3 million partially offset by lower income taxes paid 11 1 million and higher net settlement of derivatives 9 5 million the change in movements in non cash working capital items and non current ore stockpiles 98 6 million was primarily due to higher mine supplies 45 5 million build up of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the prior year 22 0 million higher stockpiling of low grade ore 17 6 million and increased value added tax recoverable at essakane 9 5 million the increase in mine supplies resulted from initiatives to optimize inventory levels increase equipment availability and lower maintenance costs including a strategic decision to re manufacture parts in house as opposed to outsourcing the benefit of these mine supplies initiatives are at the early stages of being realised ore stockpiles were higher as a result of planned increases in ore production at rosebel

attributable gold production of 103 000 ounces in the fourth quarter and 405 000 ounces for the year ended 2018 were higher by 1 and 4 respectively compared to the same prior year periods as ore feed was sourced from higher grade zones the impact of higher grades was partially offset by lower throughput realized due to coarser mill feed and lower mill availability due to maintenance on the crushing and grinding circuit mine production for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was higher compared to the same prior year periods due to increased equipment availability combined with the utilization of contractors to meet production targets essakane has implemented a new in house equipment maintenance program with the goal of increasing equipment availability increasing mining volumes and lowering maintenance costs essakane has also purchased additional mining equipment to further increase mine production and reduce reliance on mining contractors thereby reducing operating costs ore mined for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was higher compared to the same prior year periods as the mine continued through ore zones and stockpiled lower grade heap leach ore cost of sales per ounce sold was 763 for the fourth quarter 2018 and 762 for the full year lower by 4 and 3 respectively compared to the same prior year periods largely as a result of higher capitalized waste stripping in the fourth quarter 2018 essakane continued to face cost pressures with rising energy costs which were partially mitigated by the supply of energy from the solar plant and our hedging program operating costs were higher due to the utilization of contractors and higher planned maintenance reliance on contractors is expected to decline in future periods as essakane will receive new mining equipment in 2019 similarly maintenance costs are expected to decline over time as essakane transitions its maintenance in house to increase equipment availability despite these cost pressures year over year cost of sales per ounce sold for 2018 was lower primarily due to higher capitalized stripping and higher sales volume in addition a weaker u s dollar relative to the euro contributed to higher costs for the year total cash costs per ounce produced were 723 for the fourth quarter 2018 and 718 for the full year higher by 1 and lower by 3 respectively compared to the same prior year periods in the fourth quarter 2018 iamgold faced cost pressures such as rising energy costs higher contractor costs and higher maintenance costs but benefited from higher gold production and higher capitalized waste stripping year over year total cash costs were lower primarily due to higher capitalized waste stripping and higher production volume these benefits were partially offset by the increasing cost pressures noted above along with a weaker u s dollar relative to the euro included in total cash costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains from hedging programs of 9 and 17 per ounce produced respectively 2017 12 and 5 all in sustaining costs per ounce sold were 1 114 for the fourth quarter and 1 002 for the full year higher by 13 and 5 respectively compared to the same prior year periods the increases were primarily due to higher sustaining capital expenditures partially offset by lower cost of sales per ounce included in total cash costs and all in sustaining costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains from hedging programs of 10 and 19 per ounce sold respectively 2017 14 and 6 outlook iamgold expects attributable production at essakane in 2019 to be in the range of 375 000 to 390 000 ounces essakane will continue to optimize production lower unit costs and increase mine and mill efficiencies at higher proportions of hard rock through multiple optimization initiatives essakane is targeting higher fleet availability through a planned maintenance initiative designed to support an increase in mining volumes coupled with lower overall maintenance costs essakane is pursuing a mill upgrade plan with a series of improvements designed to expand mill capacity by increasing crusher throughput and optimizing liner configurations supported by the commissioning of the oxygen plant essakane is expected to improve recoveries through enhanced gold extraction with lower cyanide consumption while also reducing the negative impacts experienced when processing graphitic ore these initiatives are designed to deliver on the 2019 production and cost targets and position essakane to realize upside potential by expanding production and pursuing additional resources at satellite deposits with the potential to add to the mine life a feasibility study is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2019 outlining opportunities to further optimize the carbon in leach circuit in addition to the future potential of heap leaching at essakane for 2019 we have allocated capital to a mill de bottlenecking project to increase cil plant throughput to 13 5 million tonnes per annum at 100 hard rock which is significantly higher than the current capacity of 12 million tonnes per annum at 100 hard rock the original nameplate capacity of the plant was 10 8 million tonnes per annum at 100 hard rock in 2019 regional exploration is expected to continue on prospective targets with the objective of increasing soft rock resources in close proximity to enhance mill feed rosebel mine suriname iamgold interest 95 attributable gold production of 85 000 ounces in the fourth quarter 2018 and 287 000 ounces for the full year were 8 higher and 5 lower compared to the same prior year periods for the quarter the difference was primarily due to higher head grades and recoveries partially offset by lower throughput grades for the quarter increased compared to earlier in the year as the mine sequenced into higher grade zones as part of the mine plan throughput was lower as the ore feed increased to 85 hard and transition rock compared to 64 in the prior year period throughput was also marginally impacted by a two day unlawful work stoppage year over year attributable gold production was lower primarily due to lower throughput due to higher planned maintenance cost of sales per ounce sold was 856 for the fourth quarter and 857 for the year ended 2018 higher by 12 and 14 respectively compared to the same prior year periods rosebel faced rising energy costs and increased preventative maintenance costs combined with local labour cost increases following the finalization of the collective labour agreement in the third quarter 2018 in addition rosebel had lower capitalized waste stripping the fourth quarter 2018 benefited from higher sales volume total cash costs per ounce produced were 774 for the fourth quarter and 831 for the year ended 2018 higher by 11 and 16 respectively compared to the same prior year periods due to the cost pressures noted above included in total cash costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains from hedging programs of 4 and 8 per ounce produced respectively 2017 nil and nil all in sustaining costs per ounce sold were 981 for the fourth quarter and 1 006 for the year ended 2018 for the quarter costs were 4 lower compared to the same prior year period primarily due to lower sustaining capital expenditures partially offset by higher cost of sales per ounce year over year costs were 8 higher primarily due to higher cost of sales per ounce and higher sustaining capital expenditures included in all in sustaining costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains from hedging programs of 4 and 8 per ounce sold respectively 2017 nil and nil outlook we expect attributable production at rosebel in 2019 to be in the range of 315 000 to 330 000 ounces rosebel will continue to undertake strategic pit pushbacks on the rosebel concession unlocking higher grade ore zones while pursuing mill improvements to increase recoveries including the addition of a carbon in column plant at the tailings management facility and revisions to the sag mill liner while mill throughput in 2019 is expected to be at levels consistent with 2018 head grades are expected to improve benefiting from the commencement of ore deliveries from the saramacca deposit in the second half of the year construction will continue on the 18 kilometre haul road linking the saramacca deposit to the rosebel mill with targeted completion by mid 2019 infrastructure construction is expected to commence in the second quarter 2019 rosebel is also conducting a scoping study to evaluate the underground mining potential of saramacca which could substantially lower waste volumes thereby reducing costs saprolite mining in the initial years is expected to continue as planned with future potential for underground mining once hard rock is reached in 2019 rosebel is conducting a study on enhancing the mill design by running an open circuit sag mill combined with a secondary pebble crusher to enhance hard rock throughput and increase gold production westwood mine canada iamgold interest 100 gold production was 28 000 ounces for the fourth quarter 2018 3 lower than the same prior year period primarily due to lower head grades gold production for 2018 was 129 000 ounces or 3 higher than the prior year primarily due to higher throughput partially offset by lower head grades the lower grades reflected mining activity that sequenced through lower grade stopes as part of the mine plan head grade excluding marginal ore for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was 6 78 g t au and 7 16 g t au respectively 2017 8 01 g t au and 7 80 g t au the mine continues its strategy of utilizing excess mill capacity by custom milling ore batches from neighbouring mine sites underground development for the year ended 2018 was 10 600 metres averaging 29 metres per day and comprised 10 100 metres of lateral development and 500 metres of vertical development underground development continued in the fourth quarter 2018 to open up access to new mining areas with lateral development of approximately 2 500 metres averaging 27 metres per day during the quarter development continued to focus on the ramp breakthrough on level 132 while respecting safety protocols in place for mining in areas where seismicity is present in line with this protocol three units of bolting equipment which are designed to manage seismic exposure were received during the quarter infrastructure development continued in future development blocks at lower levels cost of sales per ounce sold of 1 086 and total cash costs per ounce produced of 1 102 for the fourth quarter 2018 were both higher by 19 compared to the same prior year period primarily due to lower sales and production volumes higher mine production and labour cost increases following the finalization of the collective labour agreement in the third quarter 2018 partially offset by a stronger u s dollar relative to the canadian dollar cost of sales per ounce sold of 886 and total cash costs per ounce produced of 884 for 2018 were higher compared to the prior year by 5 and 7 respectively primarily due to higher mine production and labour cost increases following the finalization of the collective labour agreement in the third quarter 2018 included in total cash costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains from currency hedging programs of nil and 4 per ounce produced respectively 2017 12 and 7 all in sustaining costs per ounce sold of 1 334 for the fourth quarter and 1 073 for the year ended 2018 were higher compared to the same prior year periods by 31 and 10 respectively primarily due to higher cost of sales per ounce and higher sustaining capital expenditures included in all in sustaining costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains and losses from currency hedging programs of 1 loss and 5 gain per ounce sold respectively 2017 17 gain and 12 gain outlook we expect production at westwood in 2019 to be in the range of 100 000 to 120 000 ounces as mining and development activities continue to progress in maintaining safety protocols westwood is expecting to commission additional equipment in 2019 capable of operating remotely in areas with challenging ground conditions production is expected primarily from two of the six planned mining blocks with production expected to commence midyear from block three which is deeper in the mine with a strategic focus to progress development activities in the production and expansion blocks we expect to deliver on our 2019 production and cost targets while providing achievable guidance for progression to full production sadiola mine mali iamgold interest 41 attributable gold production of 14 000 ounces for the fourth quarter and 59 000 ounces for year ended 2018 was lower by 22 and 6 respectively compared to the same prior year periods primarily due to lower head grades as a result of greater drawdowns of marginal ore stockpiles total cash costs per ounce produced of 866 for the fourth quarter 2018 were lower compared to the same prior year period as a result of lower mining costs and greater utilization of marginal stockpiles due to the cessation of mining activity in the second quarter 2018 total cash costs per ounce produced of 925 for the year ended 2018 were higher compared to the prior year as a result of lower gold production all in sustaining costs per ounce sold of 871 for the fourth quarter and 930 for year ended 2018 were lower compared to the same prior year periods as a result of lower sustaining capital expenditures mining activity ceased during the second quarter 2018 while processing of ore stockpiles continued during the second through fourth quarters an agreement with the government of mali on terms for investment in the sadiola sulphide project must be reached in order to prevent the operation from entering a phase of suspended

study during the fourth quarter 2018 we announced the results of a feasibility study fs completed jointly by iamgold and wood plc formerly amec foster wheeler with inputs from technical studies completed by other specialist consultants see news release dated november 1 2018 the fs represented a comprehensive study of the technical and economic viability of the selected development option that demonstrates the extraction of the defined mineral reserves to be economically mineable and will allow iamgold and smm to make a decision on the development of the project a supporting technical report was filed on sedar on november 26 2018 the public release of the fs triggered a final cash payment to us of 95 million from smm pursuant to the sale of a 30 interest in the côté gold project to smm in the second quarter 2017 the fs refined the development concept outlined in the pre feasibility study pfs announced in june 2017 and demonstrated significant operational and economic improvements the fs presented both a base case mine plan supported by 88 of the total mineral reserves which is aligned with the current permitting process and an extended mine plan supported by the total estimated mineral reserves the base case mine plan demonstrated that the project would generate an after tax internal rate of return of 15 2 at a 1 250 per ounce gold price the after tax net present value is 795 million at a 5 discount rate with a 4 4 year payback period the project would have a mine life of 16 years with average annual production increasing by 15 to 367 000 ounces the fs also indicates robust initial production averaging 428 000 ounces annually in years 1 to 12 life of mine lom average total cash costs would be 594 per ounce produced and all in sustaining costs 694

adjusted basic and diluted eps as performance measures to evaluate our financial results because our environmental catalysts and services segment includes our 50 interest in our zeolyst joint venture we include an adjustment for our 50 proportionate share of depreciation amortization and interest expense of our zeolyst joint venture b represents the amortization of the fair value adjustments associated with the equity affiliate investment in our zeolyst joint venture as a result of the combination of the businesses of pq holdings inc and eco services operations llc eco in may 2016 the business combination we determined the fair value of the equity affiliate investment and the fair value step up was then attributed to the underlying assets of our zeolyst joint venture amortization is primarily related to the fair value adjustments associated with inventory fixed assets and intangible assets including customer relationships and technical know how c as a result of the sovitec acquisition and the business combination there was a step up in the fair value of inventory which is amortized through cost of goods sold in the statement of operations d when asset disposals occur we remove the impact of net gain loss of the disposed asset because such impact primarily reflects the non cash write off of long lived assets no longer in use e reflects the exclusion of the negative or positive transaction gains and losses of foreign currency in the statement of operations primarily related to the euro denominated term loan which was settled as part of the february 2018 term loan refinancing and the non permanent intercompany debt denominated in local currency translated to u s dollars f represents non cash adjustments to the company s lifo reserves for certain inventories in the u s that are valued using the lifo method which we believe provides a means of comparison to other companies that may not use the same basis of accounting for inventories g reflects consulting fees paid to ccmp and affiliates of ineos for consulting services that include certain financial advisory and management services these consulting agreements were terminated upon completion of our initial public offering ipo on october 3 2017 h relates to certain transaction costs related to our ipo and the sovitec acquisition as well as other costs related to several transactions that are completed pending or abandoned and that we believe are not representative of our ongoing business operations i includes the impact of restructuring integration and business optimization expenses which are incremental costs that are not representative of our ongoing business operations j represents adjustments for defined benefit pension plan costs in our statement of operations more than two thirds of our defined benefit pension plan obligations are under defined benefit pension plans that are frozen and the remaining obligations primarily relate to plans operated in certain of our non u s locations that pursuant to jurisdictional requirements cannot be frozen as such we do not view such expenses as core to our ongoing business operations k represents a non cash gain on the write off of the remaining liability under a contractual supply arrangement as part of eco s acquisition of substantially all of the assets of solvay usa inc s sulfuric acid refining services business unit on december 1 2014 we recognized a liability as part of business combination accounting related to our obligation to serve a customer under a pre existing unfavorable supply agreement in december 2018 the customer who was party to the agreement closed its facility and as a result we were relieved from our obligation to continue to supply the customer on the below market contract because the fair value of the unfavorable contract liability was recognized as part of the application of business combination accounting and since the write off of the remaining liability was non cash in nature we believe this gain is a special item that is not representative of our ongoing business operations l other costs consist of certain expenses that are not core to our ongoing business operations including environmental remediation related costs associated with the legacy operations of our business prior to the business combination capital and franchise taxes non cash asset retirement

morning reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures are available on our investor relations website at investors msasafety com with that i ll turn the call over to our president and ceo nish vartanian nish vartanian president and chief executive officer thank you elyse and good morning everyone the msa team delivered a strong fourth quarter and as a result capped the most successful year in our company s history not only was fourth quarter revenue a record record for us we realized growth of 7 in constant currency and that s coming off a very strong comparison from 2017 adjusted earnings of 1 27 per share was down from 1 31 a year ago but as you may recall we had a record breaking fourth quarter in 2017 in terms of revenue and earnings while we were able to generate mid single digit growth in revenue our earnings line reflects higher variable compensation that is directly tied to the stronger revenue and cash flow performance in the fourth quarter kenn will cover that in more detail however we view 1 27 of adjusted earnings per share as a very strong result for the quarter and i m proud that the team was able to generate 24 adjusted earnings growth and 13 revenue growth for the full year in 2018 our growth was nicely balanced between our fire service and industrial products in fact all core product groups posted mid single to double digit growth as a combination of new products and market focused programs continue to fuel our growth and leadership positions across our portfolio with a three year adjusted earnings cagr of more than 20 there has been a step change in our profitability profile we ve improved sg a from 28 of revenue in 2015 to 24 of revenue in 2018 we acquired and integrated latchways and globe and we ve seen a strong industrial rebound driving organic revenue growth all of which contributed to double digit earnings growth that we ve now seen for three consecutive years while kenn will provide more insight into the drivers of our quarterly and full year results i want to briefly highlight some of the other key successes in 2018 notably our new product development engine and our progress in improving profitability in our international business segment let s first look at our r d commitment where we invested 53 million in 2018 i m very pleased with the momentum of our new product development pipeline for example in 2018 we launched safety io our first subsidiary focused on using wireless technology and cloud based computing to enable a broad range of connected safety services like live monitoring and fleet management on the ppe side if you recall at investors day last year we discussed the robust npd pipeline that we had planned for fall protection in 2018 which included launching 15 new products i m pleased to say we did complete all those launches by year end we introduced a series of innovations under the v series product line including a premium racing style type harness that delivers exceptional comfort and our first to market leading edge personal fall limiter the npd pipeline and investments in sales and marketing resources and fall protection collectively supported 15 growth for the quarter and 10 growth for the year we have several new exciting launches planned in the coming weeks to continue to build out the v series fall protection line in fire service we recently launched our m1 scba for the international market in fact in the fourth quarter we delivered our first m1 order to a customer in europe and we have received additional orders from customers in spain and taiwan the common thread among all these launches is leveraging technology and innovation to provide solutions that make our customers workplaces safer and more productive and we continue to do this quite well in 2018 38 of our overall revenue was from products developed and launched in the past five years in addition to fueling the npd pipeline we re keeping a sharp focus on improving the profitability of our international segment while we did see a decline in the quarter in international operating margin due primarily to higher variable compensation costs in a very difficult prior year comparison we made good strides in 2018 and are on track with our medium and long term financial goals in this region to give you a better sense of this msa international generated a full year operating margin of nearly 12 representing a 90 basis point improvement over 2017 one of the tailwinds behind this improvement was the 10 revenue growth for the full year driven by our channels optimization program overall our total number of channel partners decreased by 16 in 2018 leading to meaningful improvements in average revenue per channel partner but more importantly our progress on the channels front supports our ability to serve our customers with a more efficient go to market strategy to wrap up the team executed very well in the fourth quarter and for all of 2018 while we typically see a backlog decline from the third quarter to the fourth quarter that was not the case this year to the contrary we saw consistent backlog levels compared to the third quarter to finish the year which remain elevated when compared to both historical levels and one year ago in a quarter where we invoice more than 360 million finishing with a high level of backlog gives you some insight into the solid momentum we continue to see in our order book with that i ll turn the call over to kenn for a financial review kenn kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks nish and good morning everyone before i begin the p l review and discuss the quarter in more detail i d like to step back and provide a few key financial highlights first revenue growth was 13 for the full year or 8 in organic constant currency terms when you exclude the impact of our acquisition a year or so ago with record fourth quarter sales performance of 362 million supported by growth in all core products we exceeded the high end of a mid single digit expectation range we communicated at investor day 2018 great to see this level of growth in our business and the continued elevated level of backlog that we are carrying into 2019 profitability at both the gross and operating line remained strong annual earnings growth was over 20 again in 2018 and adjusted operating margins improved 120 basis points versus 2017 as we continue our focus on improving productivity free cash flow finished very strongly with quarterly free cash flow of over 60 million more than doubling from the same quarter a year ago despite the strong revenue growth the improvement is reflective of our ongoing focus on managing working capital for the year we reduced working capital as a percentage of sales by 220 basis points despite generating 13 revenue growth as a result 2018 marks our third consecutive year of exceeding our goal of a 100 free cash flow conversion as you compare our full year results to the long term financial expectations we communicated at our last investor day you can see that our 2018 results tracked ahead of many of the measures we discussed with you like revenue growth and cash flow generation now i d like to walk you through our fourth quarter financial results total revenue increased 7 in the quarter in constant currency with growth in nearly all core products we had a 2 fx headwind on revenue in the quarter we had a 4 headwind in the international segment as a number of currencies most notably the euro weakened versus the same quarter a year ago and a 1 headwind in the americas segment due primarily to weaker currencies in latin america we continue to see solid results in head protection portable gas detection and fall protection in the quarter we ve often talked about hard hats being a parameter for global economic conditions with that in mind it s encouraging to see revenue growth in this area in all of our operating regions to finish the year and order activity has been healthy across these areas to start the new year we had a difficult comparison in fgfd in the quarter and timing of large orders in international weighed on performance which was down 1 globally in the quarter but off 12 in the international segment our fixed gas and flame detection backlog is healthy and recent order pace has been strong quarter to date orders are up to over 10 globally to start the new year we provide some optimism heading into 2019 in the fire service area of our business we had double digit growth in scba this quarter and we continue to see ongoing benefits from the us replacement cycle and good performance in our international segment gross profit came in at just under 45 and was 40 up 40 basis points in the quarter it s good to see our leading market position supporting the improvement in margins despite the inflationary pressures in raw materials to continue offsetting rising input costs we implemented a price increase in both the americas and international segments in january and we ve tightened our special price request process globally sg a expense was 85 million in the quarter or 23 4 of sales compared to 76 million or 22 of sales a year ago the sg a increase in the quarter was primarily driven by higher levels of variable incentive compensation up about 6 million in the quarter associated with stronger financial performance in the quarter notably organic revenue growth and improvements in working capital organic revenues were up 7 over the record fourth quarter a year ago and working capital was down over 200 basis points from a year ago driven by strong improvements in the fourth quarter as i ve said before we continue to evaluate cost reduction and productivity improvement programs for our business in light of the inflationary environment that we expect to continue into 2019 along those lines we expect to make progress on our international segment footprint rationalization project in the first quarter of 2019 while these actions may drive non cash restructuring charges associated with the write off of cumulative currency translation we expect these actions to drive a more efficient business model and the steps are similar to those we took to reduce our footprint and improve our efficiency in other areas of the international segment most recently in japan gaap operating income was 42 million or 11 7 of sales in the quarter which included 20 million of other operating expense related to increasing our cumulative trauma product liability reserve the increase is mostly related to incurred but not reported or ibnr claims as we ve indicated in our filings for some time we perform a robust review of our ibnr reserve on an ongoing basis the ibnr relies on a set of facts and circumstances that we review with our actuaries and external counsel as part of that review we reflected changes in underlying assumptions in our model and recognized a charge of approximately 20 million in the fourth quarter including the increase to the reserve our total product liability reserve is 187 million at year end which is just about equal to our insurance related assets of 186 million those assets consist of receivables notes and short term investments while the timing of cash flows for product liability and insurance receivable can and do vary from quarter to quarter we ve been very successful in establishing cash flow streams that have allowed us to fund these liabilities without a material impact on our capital allocation priorities excluding foreign currency restructuring strategic transaction cost and the product liability expense i just mentioned adjusted operating margin was 18 down 40 basis points from a year ago and the higher variable compensation i mentioned a moment ago and a less favorable product mix primarily in the international segment and looking closer at the segment s adjusted operating margins showed nice improvement in the americas in the quarter up 90 basis points the improvement reflects our ability to leverage pricing programs across the segment if you recall we moved earlier in the year in 2018 on a mid year price increase in the americas and this has had a positive impact in the segment much of the margin pressure in the quarter and international came out of our middle east region on the less favorable product mix associated with a lower level of fixed gas and flame detection revenues in the region we continue to see really good traction in europe as we leverage 9 growth in the very healthy double digit earnings growth our gaap effective tax rate was about 35 for the quarter which includes discrete charges related to the adjustments associated with tax reform and extra taxes on an adjusted normalized basis our quarterly effective tax rate was just under 20 and our full year effective tax rate was 21 8 down nearly 500 basis points in 2018 due primarily to tax reform in the us in addition to driving the lower effective rate us tax reform has also provided us with the ability to repatriate foreign cash for the year we repatriated 96 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries achieving our goal of repatriating 75 million to 100 million in 2018 gaap net income was 25 million in the quarter quarterly adjusted earnings were 50 million or 1 27 per share the higher revenue gross profit and effective tax rate improvements were offset by the increase in sg a in the quarter but as nish mentioned we did expect a difficult comparison this quarter for the full year adjusted earnings were 175 million or 4 50 per share increasing 24 on the 13 increase in revenue double digit adjusted earnings growth for the third consecutive year is a reflection of the team s focus on growth while also managing the cost structure free cash flow was 62 million in the quarter compared to 29 million a year ago the current quarter includes a 11 million of net outflows from product liability compared to a prior year that reflected net outflows of 26 million underlying cash flow generation was strong with working capital finishing the year at 23 8 of revenue improving 220 basis points from the end of the third quarter despite the strong demand we saw throughout our portfolio in the fourth quarter i m very pleased to see cash conversion exceed 100 in a year where we had double digit revenue growth the team did an outstanding job managing working capital this year and we ve made great strides from a few years ago when we used to regularly trend at a rate of 70 to 80 for cash flow conversion the strong operating cash flow enabled us to pay down a 108 million of debt in 2018 and fund 57 million in dividends to our shareholders while continuing to invest in our business we remain well positioned to execute on strategic growth programs that create value debt to ebitda is 1 3 times at the end of the year compared to 2 times at year end 2017 we were able to reduce our debt while bringing on 40 million of ebitda in 2018 about a third of that profitability growth was from the globe acquisition while the remainder reflects growth and leverage in our organic business we finished the year with total bank debt of approximately 360 million with an average interest rate of 3 5 we remain very well positioned to continue to execute our strategy and to invest in our business i m pleased with the 7 revenue growth we saw in the quarter the gross profit improvements and strong free cash flow order activity and backlog remained very healthy throughout the fourth quarter and the start 2019 and that positions us well for the new year with that i ll turn the call back over to nish for some concluding commentary nish nish vartanian president and chief executive officer thanks kenn once again i m pleased with the strong performance in the quarter we had 7 revenue growth gross profit expansion of 40 basis points and earnings held up well on the difficult comparison from last year we also generated more than 100 free cash flow conversion for the quarter and for the year despite the strong top line performance this was simply great work by the team and i believe nsa remains well positioned to continue driving growth and margin expansion in 2019 thank you for your attention this morning at this time steve blanco president of the americas and bob leenen president of international have joined canada ph in a room and we ll be glad to take any questions you may have please remember that msa does not give guidance having said that we will now open up the call for your questions questions and answers operator all right great thank you operator instructions and our first question we have is from stanley elliott from stifel mr elliott please go ahead with your question stanley elliott stifel nicolaus company inc analyst thank you good morning everyone guys could you all talk about the improvements that you made on the working capital side especially with what i would have thought would been higher kind of freight transportation cost material cost et cetera and then secondly along those lines is it fair to assume that we ll see free cash flow conversion ahead of 100 again in 2019 kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hi stanley it s kenneth i ll take that question i would as i had indicated in the in the prepared commentary the team did a tremendous job at driving improvements in working capital in the fourth quarter and what was really great to see was not only the inventory improvements that we saw we saw really nice performance in inventory despite seeing some of those things you just referred to but the other thing that we saw was a really strong improvement in receivables despite seeing the uptick in revenue the focus on receivables both our current receivables as well as some of our older receivables really paid off in the us in the americas but also also over in our international segment we saw really good performance under bob leenen s leadership there as we move forward we still remain committed to driving free cash flow improvements and continuing to hold that conversion at or above 100 oftentimes it s a challenge when you are in a growth cycle like we ve seen in the last year but we ve it s been really good to see despite seeing all that growth come on us being able to leverage improvements in working capital so our focus remains the same stanley we remain committed to driving a 100 free cash flow conversion as we move forward stanley elliott stifel nicolaus company inc analyst perfect and then you guys mentioned pricing actions both internationally and domestically in january is it fair to assume that that s enough to kind of cover the cost you re maintaining a positive sort of a price cost balance going forward and then maybe what are you seeing on the inflation side on the material side and then i guess lastly the ability to look at additional pricing actions down the broad if need be nish vartanian president and chief executive officer hey stanley this is nish yes so we do have the price increase going into effect that went into effect january this year and we believe we can continue to offset anything we re seeing from a material cost standpoint the team has done a fantastic job from a pricing standpoint and in finding opportunities for price increases and then as important also on special pricing request we ve really tightened up some of the requirements and are doing a nice job with reports and monitoring our special pricing discounts and getting more sophisticated and how we manage that that side of the business so as we mentioned in 2018 we thought we could offset any inflation we saw in the material cost which we did a nice job of and we believe we can do the same here in 19 that s what requires if we see additional inflation during the year in 19 we certainly would have some sort of price adjustment mid year just as we did in north america we had that mid year price increase to offset things so we re very focused on that and we we re pretty confident we re able to execute that stanley elliott stifel nicolaus company inc analyst perfect and last from me can you guys talk about what you ve seen in the m a environment you ve done a nice job of the globe acquisition general monitors latchways it s an interesting component to the story what are you seeing out in the marketplace is it still something that you have an appetite for just any color that would be great nish vartanian president and chief executive officer sure do yes we re very active and we have a really good pipeline in place stanley realistically valuations are fairly high and as you know we ve got a good track record of buying value with general monitors latchways and globe all were accretive in the first year we d like to have a high degree of certainty about generating the right level of returns for our shareholders but i d certainly like to get one was somewhat disappointed we didn t get an acquisition in 2018 and we re very focused on that for 19 but no we re not going to chase price stanley we want to make the right move and make the right type acquisitions so we can drive that shareholder value stanley elliott stifel nicolaus company inc analyst perfect that s it from me thank you very much and congrats on a good quarter i guess a very tough comp nish vartanian president and chief executive officer thank you stanley kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you stanley operator all right and our next question we have is from richard eastman from baird mr eastman please go ahead with your question richard eastman robert w baird co analyst yes good morning to all could we just kind of spend just a second or two second on the european operating margin the kind of performance in the fourth quarter and i want to just kind of trend line that into full year discussion but just from the standpoint of the quarter was currency the currency have much of an impact on the op margin in europe and maybe you could just kind of parse out what the expectation for i ll just for international incremental might be for 19 nish vartanian president and chief executive officer so why don t i take first and then ken and bob if you guys want to chime in with some color rick the headwind for international really wasn t europe in the fourth quarter it was the middle east where a year ago fourth quarter fixed gasoline detection shipments were extremely high this year that business was soft due to two factors number one it s nature of the cycle the business the projects the projects were down this year versus last year and that s a natural cycle that we ll see in that space and then secondly one of our largest customers put a pause on purchases as they transition to the s5000 transmitter which is great news it s great news to see one of our biggest customers in the world transition to that new product the good news is is part of that elevated backlog that we have going into the first quarter we have today significant orders for s5000s for that customer and into the middle east and the project pipeline continues to build so we re fairly optimistic that the weakness we saw in the middle east will rebound here in 19 and specifically with the fixed gas and flame detection business bob do you want to add some color bob leenen vice president president msa international yes thanks nish yes it s correct we actually see a lot of activity in the market very good pipeline of opportunities and in quarter four actually in the middle east our backlog on fgfd versus the year before increased 60 so it s very encouraging to see that we had a bit of a slow period in 2018 but we structurally ph believe in the potential for the middle east market and back to the european question i ll leave the fx one to you ken europe showed in 2018 and also in q4 very solid substantial profitability improvement it was a really good first step we also know it s a longer term journey we re on with europe and we re looking at all pieces we ve grown the revenues significantly which is of course a win in our sales on the profitability as well as a significant effort by the price increases part of that we did in q4 is deploy a large amount of product and training to our commercial organization to help us with delivering the price increase in 2019 and just the productivity culture that ken refer to is something which is also front and center in europe we have some bigger tickets items we re looking at we are analyzing which are a little bit more longer term on the footprint of shared services manufacturing et cetera but also short term opportunities for productivity that were auctioning and we continue to identify more and finally our channel s optimization is the foundation behind all of this the example of inaudible we are closing is a good example of what we re able to do with the channel s optimization where in a range of countries we believe we can grow faster and be more profitable with less internal footprint and more use of channel partner so i think we re on the right track in here kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so rick you would add i believe a question on currency and kind of the incremental margin profile is that is that correct on the european business richard eastman robert w baird co analyst yes just i ramble there a little bit but i my question really was around currencies impact on the fourth quarter and then just maybe just broaden it on just the incremental margin you might expect in 19 from international and from the americas kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes so looking at currency first rick when we look at currency as i said in some of the prepared comments the euro was certainly a headwind there i think there was about a 5 headwind on revenue in the quarter and it s a consistent headwind on the earnings coming out of that segment maybe slightly smaller coming out of the european segments in terms of the earnings being translated back to the us dollar overall the incrementals are relatively healthy though you know it s hard to see the incrementals when you just look at the year over year comp because it was a challenging comp but oftentimes what i ll do is i ll look at the sequential quarter incremental margin profile and what was really nice to see with the sequential quarter in the international segment incremental margins coming in at 24 and so that was really good to see year over year is a tough comp as you know last year in the fourth quarter we did almost 15 in the international segment but we continue to see each and every quarter improvement this year and so as we head into 2019 we still think we re positioned well to drive across the business 30 incremental margin profile in our business and so it s going to come from different sources but generally the targets that we provided a year or so ago at the investor day i think are very much intact richard eastman robert w baird co analyst okay and just one last question on the head protection business just very strong all year and i m curious is that do you view that as kind of a cyclical maybe leading indicator in your business or were there some distribution gains was pricing a factor there i just really tremendous performance at a head protection throughout the year little on the fourth quarter i m just curious how that business is kind of setup as well heading into 19 nish vartanian president and chief executive officer you know it was really strong richard it s from a diversified basis all regions did really well with head protection we saw near double digit growth with every single region which is really healthy we have a very strong share in the americas and then geographically as you go around the world some areas we have better market share than others so we think we have some market share gains that we had in some international segments so the business has held up quite well and that is somewhat of a leading indicator we look at with the industrial business remember we kind of look at our business in three different segments you have the industrial quick turn products being the head protection fall protection portable gas detection and even air purifying respirator are new in that adjacent area and then the fire service typically doesn t follow that track we expect that this replacement cycle for breathing apparatus will continue on for several more years and even if there is a slow economic a little economic downturn that business should hold up pretty well and fgfd tends to be that late cycle business that comes in a little later and holds up well so if you go back to 2015 industrial recession that s where you see hard hats drops they contracted some portable gas detection contracted but the self contained breathing apparatus business for fire service that progressed quite nicely so if we have a short downturn here we might see a similar type profile as you go forward but we haven t seen that downturn yet so we re optimistic about the business richard eastman robert w baird co analyst understood great thank you operator all right and ladies and gentlemen this is your last call for any questions now is the time to ask it operator instructions and we do have another question this question is from larry de maria from william blair mr de maria please go ahead with your question larry de maria william blair analyst okay thanks good morning everybody nish vartanian president and chief executive officer good morning larry larry de maria william blair analyst good morning first clarification you just discussed tax rate expectations for 19 and also the magnitude of the price increase maybe on average across the portfolio kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer sure i ll take the tax question first larry i think we re positioned well to continue to see a very favorable tax rate here at msa i think that 23 to 24 ish kind of ranges is probably the range we d like to be in as we go through the first quarter there is a number of things we re analyzing and we ll provide more specific guidance around that for the year as we get into the first quarter but something in that range is probably not out of the realm of reason at this point from a pricing perspective i ll talk a little bit about that but also turn it over to nish i think pricing has been very strong and so as we look at our business we ve been as nish had indicated earlier in a call we were very active introducing off cycle price increase in the americas we ve continue to follow that on here earlier this year and so we re certainly positioned very strong for pricing as we head into 2019 to offset to more than offset some of the direct cost inflation that we re seeing in the business nish vartanian president and chief executive officer that s correct and so the pricing effect as of january we re looking for 1 5 to 2 net effect on that pricing that we had varies in different parts of the world so for instance in brazil we didn t have a very aggressive price increase but for most of the americas in other parts of the world we did and then again you re going to be lapping so we had the price increase for the us and canadian markets in july of last year so we ll get the additional benefit of that in the first half of this year on top of the increase they just put in place so we re very focused on that and we re not opposed to doing an off cycle price increase once again if we do continue to see inflation in the channel larry de maria william blair analyst got it that s very helpful and the 1 5 to 2 net of materials or this is the net price increase after the nominal rate when you give back some discounting kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer net price increase what we would see is net realization larry de maria william blair analyst got you now in terms of the international footprint rationalization i think like we re doing a lot more on efficiencies shared services things like this is there any appetite to do anything or maybe there is going on right now more structural rationalization maybe closing facilities and things like this at this point kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes we are we re certainly looking at that larry we ve we re taking a hard look at shared services model for europe that s where we ve really driven a lot of efficiencies in north america and south america and so we re taking a hard look at that opportunity so that s longer term that s why we this is a four five year journey that will be on with the international segment there are some things that we are able to do short term and realize some benefits in 2018 we think that ll continue in 19 but we re also looking at some more structural type activities that will probably take place over the next 12 to 18 months that ll sustain that profit improvement as we go forward and that s certainly one area we re taking a hard look at nish vartanian president and chief executive officer something that we ve said consistently larry is that we have opportunities up and down the p l and so we have manufacturing opportunities we continue to look at sourcing opportunities we continue to look at but we also have sg a opportunities that we re very much auctioning and so there is a tremendous amount of opportunities it s good to see margins in international go from sub 10 just two short years ago to now just about 12 in a really short period of time but we also continue to see more and more opportunities ahead of us to continue to improve that margin and the underlying profitability larry de maria william blair analyst okay thank you and then last question from me i would say your backlog seems healthy as you mentioned sequentially i guess flattish if you think about 19 how is the market being driven more by upgrades and replacement or is it driven by the economic growth in projects and how broad based we expect that strength to flow through your various business lines thank you nish vartanian president and chief executive officer yes i don t think it s necessarily upgrades i think it s a normal business flow we re seeing some real good gains across our product portfolio especially with the new product launches that we ve had so we think we re gaining a little bit share wise you know the growth the organic growth of 8 i think supports that thought and really the new products have done a nice job in strengthening our position in many of the markets whether it s the 5 000 series transmitter what we ve done with fall protection with the 15 products we ve launched what s really interesting is that some people talked of the slowdown as they went into the fourth quarter our fall protection business built we had some real strength in the fourth quarter and i think that was on the back of the new product launches that we had and that will continue into the first quarter of this year so we re pretty optimistic about our position in the market and what we can do going forward larry de maria william blair analyst okay thanks very much good luck nish vartanian president and chief executive officer thank you kenneth krause senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you larry elyse lorenzato director investor relations all right and it looks like our final question is from edward marshall from sidoti company mr marshall please go ahead with your question edward marshall sidoti company analyst hey g guys good morning how are you nish vartanian president and chief executive officer good good morning ed edward marshall sidoti company analyst so you just mentioned that there are levers several levers for margins sourcing manufacturing even even mix i guess can you walk about maybe what the biggest swing factor could be in margin which which of these might have the biggest impact for msa nish vartanian president and chief executive officer sure ed what we ve consistently said is we are not dependent upon one specific factor we ve got factors that avail themselves to us across the p l but the thing that s really nice to see in the work that bob is leading in international is around our channels optimization and our ability to access the customer in a much more efficient manner than we historically had so that s it s really good to see the progress we re making there but as we go forward we re looking at all of those opportunities across the p l to continue to build on this incremental margin profile that we re seeing at around 24 here in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and so we continue to look at that i ll turn it over to bob if you want to add any color there as well bob leenen vice president president msa international yes i think some of these are bigger ticket items shared services or the manufacturing footprint i think they are larger analysis that we re undertaking right now and we also especially in europe have works council process that we need to go through so we really can t talk much about that right now we have to kind of follow those process inaudible i m sure in due course we will provide more color on that edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and i think from past discussions the channel optimization was significant characteristic between the difference between what you ve seen in north america versus what international is doing i m curious maybe if you could talk baseball terms for a second maybe could you talk about what inning you think you are in the channel optimization go to market strategy with the international segment nish vartanian president and chief executive officer yes we re early in that i mean certainly third inning it s we re very much on the front end the team has really done a nice job there under some leadership the person leading that effort he was the person when i was the director of sales for north america he was the channels manager who really developed our model in north america and dave is now leading the european and international team when it comes to channels and it s been a really nice job with that team and working our way in some channels of distribution we just didn t have relationships with so we re building those relationships we re seeing some nice progress with our position within those distributors and we re building that position so we re in the early stages of that and we think that we can really gain some leverage if we execute effectively over the next several years edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and the product liability reserves i just had a few questions on that i m curious just talk about maybe the pace that you ve seen here is this kind of been consistent with what you would anticipate and also what might be driving what drives the i know there was about 1 500 lawsuits in the end of september so is that new lawsuits that drives the p l impact or is it kind of closer to decisions in the existing lawsuits that would necessarily drive that that increase in the reserve for the p l nish vartanian president and chief executive officer yes so to address your first question we feel that the product liability exposures are very well managed we continue to manage them we continue to deploy a multifaceted approach to addressing product liability and we feel like we re positioned very well to continue to manage our exposures on that front albeit it is a very uncertain area and it s an area that can change quite quickly and so we continue to keep a really close watch on that area what was really good for us to see in 2018 was all the success we had on the insurance front securing cash flow streams to help manage the liability exposure in the mitigate the impact on our cash flow performance and when we look at the overall claims experience we feel like again we re positioned well claims are certainly one of a number of things that we continue to look at and the number of claims coming in the number of the average settlement values and a number of different things that we continue the way as we look at this liability but in summary we feel like we re positioned it s a very uncertain area but we re positioned well and we ve continued to manage this area quite nicely over the last several years edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and the treatment of increases from here would it be consistent with the way you ve treated and it would this be i mean now that the insurance receivable essentially is exhausted with the current reserve how do you think about how do we think about kind of the is that i guess that s a cash use from msa at this point or are there additional insurance receivables out there and lawsuits that you re kind of pursuing thanks nish vartanian president and chief executive officer so when we look at the treatment it s the change in the ibnr was purely a non cash impact for msa it was a change in estimates and we accounted for it as such we adjusted it out of our current earnings it s entirely it is a non cash charge and it s entirely related to legacy products that we manufactured and sold decades ago and so it s not current of our it s not part of our current operations we feel like that we re positioned well as i said earlier to continue to manage through this uncertainty we still do look at our insurance profile and our insurance coverage and we still do identify opportunities to pursue additional coverages but as we have disclosed the substantial portion of our insurance assets have been secured and we ve disclosed that as such in our public filings edward marshall sidoti company analyst great thanks very much guys nish vartanian president and chief executive officer thank you operator all right great thank you and it looks like we have no further questions so i will turn it back to you elyse for final comments elyse lorenzato director investor relations thank you kelly seeing that we have no more questions that will conclude today s call if you missed a portion of the call an audio replay and transcript will be available on our investor

frans cronje tito mboweni s maiden budget reveals a stark truth about south africa short of implementing far reaching policy reforms capable of stimulating investor driven economic growth the country risks very serious political and economic reversals over the decade ahead existing policies reflect ideological hostility to markets private enterprise and risk taking investment while heavily favouring state control of the economy over structural reform and modernisation coupled with indifference to the economic social and political consequences the numbers in the 2019 budget stand as yet another warning that south africa is sailing into stormy political and economic waters this much is clear from the data economic growth expected at just 1 5 this year forecast to rise to 2 1 in 2021 the budget deficit forecast at a revised estimate of 4 2 in 2018 19 moving to 4 5 in 2019 20 and 4 3 in 2020 21 and government debt estimated to be approaching 60 what these numbers tell us is that south africa s economy is expected to grow at less than half the average rate of emerging markets as in the last decade of apartheid the deficit is set to remain a multiple of the rate of economic growth and there is no political will to rein in debt levels that have more than doubled over the past decade the risk to south africa emerges from three sources the first is in the numbers themselves even if the forecast growth rates are achieved there will be virtually no upward movement in levels of economic participation and job creation and we must remember that treasury medium term forecasts have tended to be 50 off over the past decade there is a very well established relationship between investor confidence investment gdp growth job creation revenue collection welfare reach popular confidence in the future support for the ruling party and levels of violent anti government protest action a necessary consequence of the latest growth projections is that levels of social and political stability will deteriorate markedly over the medium term the second is that global circumstances are also turning against south africa growth in europe america and china has peaked and slowdowns are forecast into 2021 with significant downside risks in the event that global trade talks fail and stimulus mechanisms and accommodative monetary and fiscal policy fade south africa will be trying to stage a recovery through an era of downward drift in global economic circumstances this brings us to the third area of risk which is government policy it would not be out of place to say that given treasury projections and global circumstances the government s policy framework borders on the insane far from securing investor confidence the administration of mr ramaphosa is squandering such confidence the much heralded mining charter has in truth shut the door on much by way of new green fields mining investment new minimum wage laws have effectively closed off avenues to formal employment for a majority of young people threats to property rights have reached a sufficiently advanced stage to in and of themselves prevent an economic recovery the proposed national health insurance scheme risks wrecking south africa s private healthcare system and with it the ability of the country to retain a strong middle class ever stricter enforcements of racial nationalist empowerment policies act as a tax on investment and reduce productivity and international competitiveness these policies speak to an ideological worldview that is hostile to markets private enterprise and risk taking investment and instead prioritises state control and direction of the economy over structural reform and modernisation while being blind to the economic social and political consequences a good example of this general problem was the extraordinary reaction both of the government and the anc to concerns raised about the investment climate towards the middle of last year should the current trajectory continue a number of things will happen the first is that a rating agency downgrade is inevitable this triggers a sharp devaluation in the currency and rising debt service costs the government is later forced either to seize pension funds print money or surrender policy sovereignty in exchange for a bailout south african growth rates underperform relative to forecasts with a very real risk of slipping into a long term recession as living standards deteriorate rapidly and political instability rises very few analysts are prepared to publicly concede the risks or admit to the structural reforms that will be needed to turn the tide those reforms now by necessity include deregulating the labour market abandoning minimum wages slashing civil service expenditure putting an end to preferential procurement policies selling parastatals repealing race based empowerment and equity laws and replacing these with policies focused on actual socio economic disadvantage allowing parents to take management control of schools introducing a hybrid constituency based electoral system affording greater policy making powers to provinces and reversing every threat to property rights short of implementing this list south africa risks very serious political and economic reversals over the decade ahead those reversals will reduce living standards erode much of the socio economic progress made since 1994 and call into further doubt the sustainability of the constitutional order civil rights and the rule of law frans cronje is the ceo of the institute of

new orders for key u s made capital goods unexpectedly fell in december amid declining demand for machinery and primary metals pointing to a sustained slowdown in business spending on equipment that could further crimp economic growth the economy s outlook was also dimmed by other reports on thursday showing a measure of factory activity in the mid atlantic region contracted in february for the first time since may 2016 and home resales plunging to a more than three year low in january the reports together with data last week showing steep declines in retail sales in december and manufacturing output in january strengthen the federal reserve s patient stance toward raising interest rates further this year minutes of the u s central bank s jan 29 30 policy meeting published on wednesday noted that some risks to the downside had increased with regard to the outlook for the economy the fed left interest rates unchanged at that meeting and discarded promises of further gradual increases in borrowing costs it appears the bloom is off the economic expansion rose said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania and a newsmax finance insider the data don t paint a picture of strong growth going forward the commerce department said orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched proxy for business spending plans dropped 0 7 percent data for november was revised down to show these so called core capital goods orders falling 1 0 percent instead of declining 0 6 percent as previously reported economists polled by reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0 2 percent in december core capital goods orders increased 6 1 percent on a year on year basis shipments of core capital goods rose 0 5 percent in december after an unrevised 0 2 percent drop in the prior month core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement while the rebound in core capital goods shipments suggests continued moderate growth in business spending on equipment in the fourth quarter the surprise drop in orders points to weakness in the months ahead the december report was delayed by a 35 day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on jan 25 the commerce department said the processing and data quality were monitored throughout and response and coverage rates were at or above normal levels for this release the dollar trimmed gains versus a basket of currencies on the data and stocks on wall street were trading lower u s treasury prices fell darkening clouds the softening business spending outlook was highlighted by a another report on thursday from the philadelphia fed showing its manufacturing activity index dropped to a reading of 4 1 this month from 17 0 in january that was the first negative reading since may 2016 a reading below zero indicates contraction in the region s manufacturing sector however manufacturers in the region that covers eastern pennsylvania southern new jersey and delaware remained generally upbeat about business conditions over the next six months business spending on equipment has been slowing since the second quarter of 2018 despite the white house s 1 5 trillion tax cut some companies including apple used their tax windfall to buy back shares on a massive scale a survey last month showed lower taxes had not caused companies to change hiring or investment plans there was more bad news from the housing market which has lagged other sectors in a third report the national association of realtors said existing home sales dropped 1 2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 94 million units last month the lowest level since november 2015 but prospects for the housing market are improving with mortgage rates declining to a one year low and house price inflation slowing which could make home buying more appealing for now the weak housing market is more evidence that the economy struggled early in 2019 after hitting a soft patch in the fourth quarter but the bigger picture is that a slowing economy as well as the continued problem of a lack of inventory will keep a lid on sales growth this year said matthew pointon property economist at capital economics in new york a fourth report from the conference board showed a measure of future u s economic activity slipped in january after being unchanged in december amid predictions of a considerable deceleration in growth by the end of 2019 jpmorgan trimmed its gdp growth estimate for the fourth quarter of 2018 by one tenth of a percentage point to a 1 4 percent rate the government will publish the fourth quarter gdp report next thursday the economy grew at a 3 4 percent pace in the third quarter the economy s outlook has been clouded by fears of a sharp slowdown in global growth especially in china and europe fading fiscal stimulus trade tensions as well as uncertainty regarding britain s departure from the european union despite the darkening clouds the labor market remains strong though the trend in layoffs has been indicating some weakness in a fifth report on thursday the labor department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 23 000 to a seasonally adjusted 216 000 for the week ended feb 16 but the four week moving average of initial claims considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility rose 4 000 to 235 750 last week the highest level since january 2018 it looks like the labor market has cooled lately and this is not too surprising given that job growth has been robust in recent months despite other signs that the economy has slowed said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york

2017 the average price per megabit for our new contracts for the quarter was flat sequentially and also flat year over year at 0 42 for all periods some comments on arpu our on net and off net arpu both decreased sequentially for the quarter our on net arpu which includes both corporate and netcentric customers was 467 for the quarter which was a decrease of 0 8 from last quarter our off net arpu which is comprised predominantly of corporate customers was 1 124 for the quarter and that was a decrease of 1 3 comments on churn our on net unit churn rate was stable and our off net unit churn rate improved during the quarter our on net unit churn rate was 1 for the quarter which was the same rate as last quarter our off net unit churn rate was also 1 and that was an improvement from 1 2 from last quarter some comments on move out change orders for netcentric customers we offer discounts related to contract term to all of our corporate and netcentric customers we also offer volume commitment discounts to our netcentric customers during this quarter certain netcentric customers took advantage of our volume and contract term discounts and entered into long term contracts for over 2 800 customer connections and that increased their revenue commitment to cogent by over 22 2 million so more details on ebitda and ebitda as adjusted our ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are reconciled to our cash flow from operations in all of our quarterly earnings press releases seasonal factors that typically impact our sg a expenses and consequently our ebitda and ebitda as adjusted include the resetting of payroll taxes at the united states at the beginning of each year annual cost of living or cpi increases the timing and level of our audit and tax services net neutrality fees and the timing and amount of our gains on equipment transactions and our annual sales meeting costs which typically occur in january and benefit plan annual cost increases our quarterly ebitda increased by 643 000 or by 1 4 sequentially to 47 6 million and increased year over year by 4 3 million or by 10 our ebitda increased by 23 2 million or by 14 4 for full year 2018 over 2017 our quarterly ebitda margin decreased 10 basis points sequentially to 36 and increased quarterly year over year by 150 basis points our full year 2018 ebitda margin increased by 230 basis points over 2017 and again as dave mentioned this 2018 ebitda margin percentage of 35 5 represents the largest annual ebitda margin percentage in our history our ebitda as adjusted includes gains on our equipment transactions and our equipment gains have recently been declining and were only 92 000 for the quarter down from 319 000 from the fourth quarter of last year and 416 000 from last quarter our equipment gains were 1 million for 2018 as compared to 3 9 million for last year our quarterly ebitda as adjusted increased by 319 000 or by 0 7 sequentially to 47 7 million and increased year over year by 4 1 million which was 9 4 our ebitda as adjusted increased by 20 4 million or by 12 3 for the full year and our quarterly ebitda as adjusted margin decreased sequentially by 30 basis points to 36 1 and increased by 130 basis points year over year some comments on earnings per share our basic and diluted income per share was 0 16 for the quarter compared to 0 18 last quarter and a loss per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 0 14 as a reminder the signing of the tax cuts and job act in december of 2017 reduced the corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35 to a flat 21 rate and resulted in an increase of our non cash deferred income tax expense by about 11 3 million in the fourth quarter of last year and also the full year of 2017 under us gaap because of the reduction in the income tax rate our net deferred tax asset was revalued in the fourth quarter of 2017 using the lower income tax rate the income tax rate change impact represented about 0 25 of a loss per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter of last year and full year 2017 some comments on foreign currency impact our revenues reported in us dollars and earned outside of the united states represented about 22 of our total revenues about 17 of our revenues this quarter were based in europe and about 5 of our revenues were related to our canadian mexican asia pacific and latin american operations continued volatility in foreign exchange rates can materially impact our quarterly revenue results and our overall financial results the foreign exchange impact on our reported quarterly sequential revenue was a negative 0 5 million and the year over year foreign exchange impact on our reported quarterly revenue was a negative 0 9 million for full year 2018 the impact was a positive 4 million our quarterly revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis were 1 8 sequentially 6 2 year over year and 6 4 for full year 2018 over full year 2017 the impact of foreign exchange primarily impacts our netcentric revenues the average euro to us dollar rate so far this quarter is 1 14 and the average canadian dollar exchange rate is 0 75 should these average foreign exchange rates remain at the current average levels for the remainder of this quarter the first quarter of 2019 we estimate that the fx conversion impact on our sequentially quarterly revenues for this quarter will not be material however the year over year conversion impact on quarterly revenues is estimated to be material and to be a negative 1 9 million customer concentration we believe that our revenue and customer base is not highly concentrated and our top 25 customers represented less than 6 of our revenues this quarter comments on capex our capital expenditures for the quarter declined sequentially by 9 7 our capital expenditures were 10 9 million this quarter compared to 10 6 million for the fourth quarter of last year and 12 1 million for the third quarter of 2018 our capital expenditures were 49 9 million for the full year as compared to 45 8 million for 2017 capital lease and capital lease payments our capital lease iru obligations are for long term dark fiber leases and typically have initial terms of 15 to 20 years or longer and often include multiple renewal options after the initial term our capital lease iru fiber lease obligations totaled 163 8 million at year end and at quarter end and year end we had iru contracts with a total of 239 different dark fiber suppliers our capital lease principal payments under these iru agreements were 2 1 million for the quarter and if you combine these payments with our capex there was a decrease sequentially by 8 and that total was 13 1 million this quarter compared to 14 2 million for the third quarter and 12 5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 capital lease payments combined with capex were 60 2 million this year compared to 57 million last year we added 37 more buildings to our network in 2018 than we added in 2017 and that is 28 an addition of 28 more on net buildings this year cash and operating cash flow at year end our cash and cash equivalents totaled 276 1 million for the quarter our cash decreased by 8 5 million we returned 38 4 million of capital to our stakeholders this quarter during the quarter we paid 26 5 million for our dividend 5 3 million was spent on a semiannual interest payment on our debt and we bought stock this quarter totaling 6 6 million our quarterly operating cash flow increased sequentially by 28 3 to 40 7 million and increased by 29 9 year over year this operating cash flow of over 40 million this quarter was the greatest quarterly operating cash flow in our 19 year history and our operating cash flow was 133 9 million for the year which was an increase of almost 20 over last year our total gross debt at par including capital leases was 809 2 million at year end and our net debt was 533 2 million our total gross debt to trailing last 12 months ebitda as adjusted ratio was 4 36 at year end and our net debt ratio was 2 87 finally some comments on bad debt and day sales and accounts receivable our bad debt expense was again only 0 7 of our revenues for the quarter and only 0 6 of our revenue for the year and that total amount was down 300 000 year over year for the year our days sales outstanding for worldwide accounts receivable was only 25 days that was the same amount as the end of last year and i want to again thank and recognize our worldwide billing and collections team members for continuing to just do a fantastic job in serving our customers and collecting from our customers and with that i will turn the call back over to dave dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer hey thanks tad i d like to take a moment and comment on the scale and scope of our network and its expansion we have over 944 million square feet of multi tenant office space in north america directly on our network we added 170 buildings to our network in 2018 our network consists of 32 900 metro fiber miles and over 57 400 intercity route miles of fiber the cogent network remains the most interconnected network in the world and we have direct connectivity with over 6 580 networks which less than 30 of these networks are settlement free peers the remaining networks are all cogent transit customers we are currently utilizing approximately 31 of the lit capacity in our network we routinely augment segments of the network to maintain these low utilization rates for the quarter we achieved sequential traffic growth of 10 and on a year over year basis our traffic grew by 44 in the quarter we operate 52 of our own data centers which comprise 587 000 feet of raised floor space and are today operating at approximately 32 utilization our sales force turnover was approximately 5 in the quarter which is better than our long term sales force turnover rate of monthly 5 7 our quarterly sales rep productivity as measured on a monthly basis per full time equivalent was 5 7 installed orders per rep per month this is above our long term average of 5 1 orders installed per full time equivalent rep per month we ended the quarter with 487 sales reps selling our services which is a significant increase from the 453 reps that we had at the end of q3 and the most number of sales reps selling our services we ve had in our corporate history in summary cogent is a low cost provider of internet services transit services and our value proposition remains unmatched in the industry our business remains completely focused on the internet ip connectivity and data center colocation all of which are necessary utilities to our customers beginning in april 1 of 2018 we began also selling sd wan services which thus far has not been a material contributor to our revenues but we do expect to continue to grow our multi year constant currency long term revenue growth target is approximately 10 due to the slowdown in our netcentric business and our long term ebitda margin expansion rate is expected to be approximately 200 basis points per year our board of directors has approved yet another increase to our quarterly dividend of 0 02 per share bringing that quarterly dividend to 0 58 per share per quarter our dividend increases demonstrate the continued optimism regarding the cash flow generating capabilities of our business we will be opportunistic about the timing of purchase of our common stock during the quarter we purchased 148 000 shares of our common stock for 6 6 million at an average price per share of 44 36 at the end of the quarter we still have 34 9 million remaining under our current authorized buyback program we are committed to returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders on a regular basis with that i d like to open it up for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from colby synesael of cowen and company your line is open unidentified participant analyst great thanks for taking the questions this is john ph on for colby how much has your view on the long term growth potential for the netcentric business changed since last quarter especially given the tweak to your growth targets of 10 now and how should we be thinking about the growth or trends within that business over the next couple of quarters thank you dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer yeah so i think our long term view is the netcentric business will continue to improve and return to its long term average growth rate of about 9 5 year over year as i mentioned in the last call and have repeated at multiple interactions with investors that business has continued to underperform for a number of reasons while traffic growth has accelerated revenue growth has lagged on a full year basis revenues were down four tenths of a percent if you fx adjust that they were up 2 6 2018 over 2017 which is a substantially lower growth rate than the 9 5 long term average based on the slower rate of recovery in that business it made sense for us to revise our long term growth rate to be realistic about the amount of time it s going to take for that business to recover but our ultimate view is traffic growth will continue to accelerate price declines will be at historic full the average rates about 23 per year and cogent will continue to gain market share growing about twice as fast as the market so with those parameters we do expect to eventually return to netcentric growth in that 9 to 10 range and therefore our total growth rate will be back in the 10 to 20 range but due to the fact that we do not have visibility to when that will occur it seemed prudent to reduce the total business revenue growth target to 10 which is still substantially better than any other wireline telecom service provider who is growing organically globally unidentified participant analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from matthew niknam with deutsche bank your line is open unidentified participant analyst hey guys this is actually benjamin ph on for matt thanks for taking the question just one quick one on the sales force so you guys noted that there was lower churn this quarter and we also saw sort of the highest net additions there that we have in a while just wanted to dig in there and see if there s anything to call out around is this lower churn a trend has your strategy changed around how many people you want to add just anything there thanks dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer yeah so we remain pleased with the initiatives that we ve put in place and continue to enhance on the sales force as we ve spoken about with investors in the past we have implemented a much more formalized and rigorous training program that has allowed us to reduce churn we have experienced lower sales force turnover over the last several quarters and continue to see the ability to improve that number even further in terms of total number of sales people we expect to grow the sales force somewhere between 7 and 10 annually we achieved that 17 over 18 and we expect similar type aggregate growth in the sales force in 2019 versus 2018 to help facilitate that we continue to open additional sales offices recently we opened offices in columbus ohio singapore and in montreal to augment the footprint that we have in place and then finally we think that the training efforts that we have put in place have been responsible for enhanced sales force productivity and our rep productivity at 5 7 orders per full time equivalent rep per month installed continues to be substantially above our long term average so it is this improvement in both the size of the sales force and the efficiency of the sales force that gives us confidence that our aggregate business will continue to grow and our operating margins will continue to improve and therefore our ability to grow cash flow at nearly 20 and therefore grow the dividend at a similar rate unidentified participant analyst great thanks operator our next question comes from frank louthan with raymond james your line is open frank louthan raymond james analyst yeah can you just give us an update on the sales force progression in the netcentric business where do you expect that expect that to be over the next 12 months and is there anything changed in sort of your hiring and so forth with how you ve already done that organization dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer yes hey frank so today we have 141 of our 487 reps are netcentric they are effectively equally divided between north america and the rest of the world we continue to expect to grow both the corporate and netcentric sales forces at about the same rate the opening of the office in singapore is focused purely on the netcentric market whereas the columbus office is mostly focused on the retail market with limited netcentric opportunities in that part of the country we continue to enhance the training of both sales organizations and we feel comfortable that over the long run the netcentric business will improve from that 2 6 year over year growth back to the 9 5 we just don t know exactly when that s going to happen so that was the reason for the slightly more conservative guidance targets going forward but we think we have the right number of netcentric reps their turnover is substantially lower than that of the corporate reps and we expect their productivity continue to remain at elevated levels just as we re seeing from the entire sales force frank louthan raymond james analyst so what is sort of the trick then to get it back up you tweaked around a little bit with sort of their focus or is it focusing more on web scale providers and things like that what exactly do you think will it s going to take to get that growth rate back up it s a pretty big jump dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer sure so a couple of points frank first of all the unit growth has already reaccelerated the traffic growth numbers have reaccelerated what we have seen however is over the past year most of that unit growth has come from our largest customers which get the lowest price point it has been that lower priced traffic that has retarded our revenue growth rate we believe that is a temporary phenomena for two reasons one some of our netcentric customers who previously had paid direct connect agreements that they were pressured into in the period of constrained ports when there were violations of net neutrality are now able to divert their traffic back to cogent and utilize transit as a lower cost and easier to use service secondly we have seen organic growth rates of the larger web centric customers hyperscale providers outpace that of the general market i think that is a more transitory phenomena and we would expect that over the next year or two the market growth rates of both large and small customers to homogenize and become equivalent whereas today we are seeing a disproportionate growth from our largest customers so there s actually nothing wrong with the netcentric sales efficiency and efficacy the issue is they re actually selling to big customers which is depressing the effective price per megabit and we think that s a temporary phenomenon frank louthan raymond james analyst okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from nick del deo with moffettnathanson your line is open nicholas ralph del deo moffettnathanson llc analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my questions first dave as you noted in your prepared remarks you had really strong margin expansion in 2018 even despite revenue growth coming in a bit shy of your goals that seemed to be mostly driven by sg a controls even though sg a leverage in q4 was a bit lower than the first three quarters of the year were there any sg a drivers that made an outsized contribution to margin expansion during the year or other drivers that we should bear in mind as we think about 2019 dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer so first of all nick roughly 100 basis points of our margin expansion came from cogs efficiency as our cost of goods sold continued to decline as a percentage of revenues our gross margins increased from 57 to 58 we have said that over the long term that roughly 200 basis points per year of margin expansion will come almost equally from cogs efficiency and sg a efficiency on the sg a part of your question we are getting more efficacy out of the sales force we are getting better utilization of our sales infrastructure as the sales force grows the management spend sort of control are filling out and we are not adding significantly to our g a headcount it is really all of those things that have attributed to the sg a operating leverage in the business so on the network side it s the sale of on net services and the high operating leverage that comes from that the lower operating leverage but still substantial that comes from selling off net and then on the sg a side it s really just utilizing our infrastructure more efficiently if we look over the long term cogent s ebitda contribution margins have been 43 7 that is actually still substantially above the 35 5 that we delivered for full year 2018 but we are also seeing our contribution margins improve and in fact for 2018 our contribution margins were about 58 which is substantially above that long term average we actually expect that to continue and it is why even though we revised our target for total revenue growth due to the slower revenue growth on the netcentric portion of the business we remain confident in our ability in 2019 to deliver approximately 200 basis points of ebitda margin expansion and we actually expect that to continue in the out years as well again this is not short term guidance but long term nicholas ralph del deo moffettnathanson llc analyst got it that s great color and then maybe can you give us any sort of update on your sd wan offering in terms of client interest and your sales funnel maybe highlight anything unexpected or interesting you ve learned from a marketing or operating perspective since you launched it dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer yeah so i said there are really three takeaways from our launch the customers that have deployed have been happy with the service two i think a lot of prospective customers are confused about what the technology actually can deliver and where it is superior to our vpls offering so i would actually say that one of the big advantages of offering sd wan has actually been the commencement of conversations with mpls customers who want to switch off of mpls and as they evaluate the two technologies some of those customers have actually chosen vpls over sd wan some have chosen sd wan and i think universally what our sales force is saying is any customer that today is operating an mpls network is frustrated they are frustrated with the high cost the lack of flexibility and the difficulty of managing that network over the long term so there are about 1 3 million mpls ports deployed in north america and that represents close to 45 billion in spend we think that all of that is vulnerable to replacement and will be migrating to sd wan or to vpls i think the third point i d like to make is customers remain confused about what sd wan can deliver versus some of the promises that have been made by some of the equipment vendors and there are a multitude of vendors in the market selling cpe equipment and they make a number of promises or boasts about their equipment that are probably not completely accurate and a big part of the sales effort has actually been our sales force managing customer expectations and those expectations really are around throughput and feature set and it s a trade off if you turn all of the feature sets on in terms of security control and multi vendor interfaces you then end up sacrificing throughput if you re focused on throughput in many ways a vpls solution is more mature but we re seeing success with both products and our vpns delivered over both technologies continue to increase as a percentage of our revenues and have grown from 17 to 18 of total revenues and are up from 25 to about 27 of corporate revenues nicholas ralph del deo moffettnathanson llc analyst got it that s great color dave thanks so much dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer hey thanks nick operator thank you and i m not showing any further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to mr schaeffer for any closing remarks dave schaeffer founder and chief executive officer okay well first of all i d like to thank everyone for joining us i know today is a busy day and there are some other investor events going on but we remain pleased with our performance we are encouraged by the cash flow generation that our business is continuing to demonstrate in a market where other wireline carriers have been struggling and our commitment to returning increasing amounts of cash to our shareholders has been demonstrated by both our buyback and dividend increase strategy so i want to thank everyone i want to thank the entire cogent team and we ll be talking soon operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in
