international it was the year central banks jumped back into the fray cutting interest to deal with a slowdown driven by a trade war and subsequent decline in manufacturing some like the federal reserve had at least made some headway on rate hikes before 2019 creating room to loosen amid the weakest growth since the financial crisis but others like the european central bank found themselves in a more difficult position and had to cut benchmarks further below zero stoking resentment about subzero rates 2020 looks like it might be a quieter year for monetary policy fiscal may take up some of the lifting work and growth prospects are looking a little brighter the economic numbers are mostly mixed rather than positive though on balance the monetary policy bias still leans to the dovish side while the big guns are set to hold fire others especially in the emerging markets are projected to cut again what bloomberg s economists say a moment of calm in the global economy is obscuring a serious challenge for the world s central banks low rates for most and negative for some means policy space is severely depleted we don t think the next downturn is coming in 2020 when it does come central banks won t have all the answers tom orlik here is bloomberg economics quarterly review of 23 of the top central banks which together set policy for almost 90 of the global economy u s federal reserve current federal funds rate upper bound 1 75 forecast for end of 2020 1 75 fed chairman jerome powell has left no doubt that interest rates are on prolonged hold saying dec 11 the current stance likely will remain appropriate unless the fed s favorable outlook for the economy sees a material reassessment he spoke after policy makers kept interest rates steady in a 1 5 to 1 75 target range following three consecutive cuts and published forecasts showing 13 of 17 officials projecting no change in rates through 2020 that would keep them on the sidelines during a presidential election year that said the u s central bank isn t entirely fading into the background strain in money markets has pushed it to buy treasury bills to restore ample reserves in the banking system some investors argue it will need to broaden the scope of those purchases to short dated coupon bearing securities powell said they were not ready to take such a step but would do so if necessary what bloomberg s economists say the fed is comfortably on hold for the foreseeable future as policy makers are less concerned by the risks which justified their insurance cuts in the latter half of 2019 trade tensions below target inflation and sluggish global growth the threshold is high for policy adjustments in the near term particularly for rate hikes and the impetus to stand pat will increase as the u s election draws nearer carl riccadonna european central bank current deposit rate 0 5 forecast for end of 2020 0 5 the ecb has pledged to step up stimulus again if needed yet officials have publicly signaled that they favor a pause after mario dragh pushed through a contentious package in september to aid the slowing euro zone economy policy makers are increasingly pointing to the detrimental side effects of the institution s negative deposit rate such as squeezed bank profitability and risks to financial stability and christine lagarde draghi s successor at the helm of the institution has promised to assess them as part of the first strategic review since 2003 economists and investors expect rates to stay on hold and qe to continue through the whole of 2020 and beyond but the central bank may yet be tested again if the economy falters under trade uncertainties or the bloc s manufacturing meltdown spreads to the services sector what bloomberg s economists say mario draghi used the end of his tenure to shape the governing council s response to the persistent slowdown in the euro area economy president christine lagarde s first press conference confirmed policy makers are unlikely to change course over the next year they will focus instead on their strategic review we expect the new round of bond buying to go on for two years maeva cousin david powell bank of japan current policy rate balance 0 1 forecast for end of 2020 0 1 the outlook for the bank of japan in 2020 is looking a little brighter after the launch of a government spending package to support growth and some signs of improvement in the global economy that s likely to keep the bank on hold for now with its key rate already in negative territory and assets on its balance sheet worth more than the nation s economy the hurdle to move again is high despite guidance the bank says is tilted toward easing still governor haruhiko kuroda will carefully monitor developments in the u s china trade talks and the economic hit from a sales tax increase in the autumn some economists are starting to doubt if the impact of the tax hike really will be smaller than on previous occasions as is hoped by policy makers but it may still take a damaging jump in the yen to move the needle at the boj what bloomberg s economists say the bank of japan heads into 2020 with significant less weight on its shoulders that s not to say the inflation and growth picture has improved but with a fiscal stimulus package in the pipeline and jgb yields comfortably within the target range there s much less urgency we expect the boj to keep its current policy framework unchanged through 2020 barring an unexpected shock yuki masujima bank of england current bank rate 0 75 forecast for end of 2020 0 75 the bank of england will finally get a new governor in 2020 bringing to an end an often chaotic search for a successor to mark carney boris johnson s decisive win in december s election both cleared the way for his government to take the nation out of the european union on jan 31 and also name the u k s top regulator andrew bailey as the canadian s successor bailey who starts on march 16 will have to cope with a global slowdown and a persistent dearth of investment most worryingly another brexit deadline is already looming with the u k needing to secure a trade deal with the eu by the end of next year unless johnson asks for an extension for now concern about the outlook means two of the boe s nine policy makers want to cut interest rates all eyes will be on whether johnson s win as well as brexit developments change the picture what bloomberg s economists say weak growth momentum and below target inflation means the bank of england is likely to maintain its dovish bias in early 2020 but if our forecast plays out and the combination of looser fiscal policy and reduced brexit uncertainty lift growth next year we expect the central bank s tone to change we have penciled in a rate increase in 4q2020 dan hanson bank of canada current overnight lending rate 1 75 forecast for end of 2020 1 75 governor stephen poloz ends 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1 75 and is expected to hold that title until his seven year term comes to an end in june the bank of canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend inflation has been near its 2 target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fueling a further increase in debt one main downside from the central bank s outlier status has been a stronger currency that is hurting exporters but pressure on the bank of canada to match rate cuts by the federal reserve and others is easing there are signs the world economic outlook is stabilizing and markets are paring back bets that global monetary loosening has much left to go that makes the bank of canada s diverging policy path less of a risky bet for poloz s eventual successor people s bank of china current 1 year best lending rate 4 35 current 7 day omo reverse repo rate 2 50 forecast for end of 2020 4 35 2 35 analysts predicting the start of large scale monetary easing by the people s bank of china in 2019 were persistently disappointed and governor yi gang has indicated he intends follow the modest targeted path for stimulus in 2020 that said if weakness in the world s second largest economy worsens then economists expect the central bank to continue to release cash into the system via cuts to the reserve ratio as has been a preferred method to shore up output this year the cautious approach to easing is determined by china s current battle with a form of stagflation consumer price gains driven beyond the pboc s target of 3 by food coupled with factory prices in decline economists currently forecast economic growth to slow below 6 percent next year a development that communist party leaders seem comfortable with a recent revision to 2018 gdp data means that the long standing goal to double the size of the economy this decade is more easily in reach that lifts some of the burden on the pboc to artificially boost the expansion what bloomberg s economists say the people s bank of china is pushing down lending rates steadily and incrementally the drop in the one year lpr in november underlines its effort to prop up growth and counter disinflationary pressures a similar fall in the five year lpr the benchmark for new mortgage loans was a surprise and suggests that a cooling housing sector is giving the authorities more room for monetary stimulus chang shu reserve bank of india current repo rate 5 15 forecast for end of 2020 4 7 india s central bank is likely to resume easing interest rates perhaps in the middle of 2020 and once headline inflation comes off the boil costly onions have pushed inflation closer to the upper end of the reserve bank of india s 2 6 target band limiting policy makers ability to support an economy expanding at its weakest pace in more than six years a much higher than expected spike in inflation was the reason for the rbi s surprise pause on rate cuts in december after delivering 135 basis points of easing in five back to back moves this year however governor shaktikanta das has made it clear that there s more space for monetary easing and a lot depends on how these actions are timed what bloomberg s economists say the reserve bank of india s shock hold on rates in december signaled that it s more concerned about a temporary surge in onion prices pushing headline inflation higher than slumping growth we expect the central bank to keep rates on hold again in february due to the further surge in onion prices since then rbi s accommodative stance signals that room for further easing is available abhishek gupta central bank of brazil current selic target rate 4 5 forecast for end of 2020 4 5 brazil s central bank is closing a monetary easing cycle that has taken its benchmark interest rate to an all time low of 4 5 while investors are still debating whether the rate may drop an additional 25 basis points they mostly agree it should stay near the current level by end 2020 the unprecedentedly long spell of low interest rates is supported by the fact that inflation expectations remain within the official target for the next couple of years at least latin america s largest economy is also gaining traction after nearly three years of disappointing performance but the recovery remains gradual what bloomberg s economists say bcb started a new round of rate cuts last july but appears to be close to a pause anchored inflation expectations and ample economic slack base our expectation that it will remain at this level through end 2020 absent surprises an additional smaller 25bps cut in the february meeting cannot be ruled out if inflation and growth surprise on the downside or if the currency strengthens until then adriana dupita bank of russia current key rate 6 25 forecast for end of 2020 6 after years of struggle to bring down high inflation bank of russia governor elvira nabiullina is now facing a serious undershoot of her 4 target five consecutive rate cuts have so far failed to stoke price growth or do much to boost the sputtering economy partly because of a delay to government spending in the second half of 2019 nabiullina said in december that the effect of easing will take time and the central bank needs to wait to evaluate the impact another rate cut is possible at the next meeting in february or later in the first half but not guaranteed she said russian local currency government bonds have attracted inflows of about 16 billion this year due in part to faster than expected easing investors are waiting to see if 2020 will bring more of the same what bloomberg s economists say sliding inflation will keep one more rate cut on the table in 2020 but policy makers are likely to pause to assess the impact of 150 basis points of reductions since june if price pressure remains muted as we expect the next move could come as soon as march signs of a firmer rebound in inflation as president vladimir putin s fiscal stimulus finally gets going might put policy on hold for longer scott johnson south african reserve bank current repo average rate 6 5 forecast for end of 2020 6 25 it was the year central banks jumped back into the fray cutting interest to deal with a slowdown driven by a trade war photo supplied the south african reserve bank is facing pressure to ease after the economy unexpectedly contracted in the third quarter and power cuts raised the risk of a second recession in as many years inflation is at a nine year low and close to the bottom of the target range of 3 to 6 still the monetary policy committee has made it clear that some of the factors weighing on economic growth such as policy uncertainty and the deterioration of government finances will probably prevent it from cutting rates using monetary policy to compensate for government failures is not the way forward governor lesetja kganyago said at the final mpc meeting of 2019 the prospect of the country a losing its last investment grade credit rating at moody s investors service in 2020 may also prevent easing while the move is largely priced in it s likely to weaken the rand a downgrade could result in a selloff of between 5 billion and 8 billion of south african bonds deputy governor kuben naidoo said banco de mexico current overnight rate 7 25 forecast for end of 2020 6 5 mexico s central bank slashed the interest rate a full point in 2019 from a decade high after inflation reached its 3 target and economic growth flat lined with a muted economic rebound expected in 2020 policy makers are forecast to continue loosening while banco de mexico expects inflation to pick up slightly in the first quarter of next year it s projected to return to near their goal after that the majority of the board says monetary policy needs gradual adjustment voting for quarter point reductions policy makers appointed by president andres manuel lopez obrador have voted for steeper half point cuts recently pointing out that the central bank s stance remains restrictive even after the easing in 2019 mexico has the highest real interest rate or borrowing costs minus inflation among group of 20 nations what bloomberg s economists say banxico should continue slowly cutting interest rates in 2020 lower inflation subdued pressure on prices and abating inflation expectations support the outlook interest rates remain high and cuts imply less restrictive instead of expansionary monetary conditions felipe hernandez bank indonesia current 7 day reverse repo rate 5 forecast for end of 2020 4 75 indonesia s central bank has been on an aggressive run of easing lowering borrowing costs by 100 basis points since july in a bid to bolster faltering growth while southeast asia s biggest economy is holding up quite well compared to others growing at about 5 it has felt the effects of a global slowdown and the u s china trade war with export growth having contracted for 13 straight months with the economy expected to grow this year at its slowest pace since 2017 governor perry warjiyo has signaled more rate cuts are in the pipeline although dependent on incoming information on the health of the economy at the same time inflation is subdued by indonesia standards and is expected to moderate further prompting bank indonesia to set a new inflation target range of 2 4 for 2020 from 2 5 4 5 this year pointing to more room for further rate cuts what bloomberg s economists say more rate reductions appear to be in the pipeline for 2020 though we expect the pace to slow dramatically the federal reserve signaled an end to its easing cycle which gives bank indonesia less room to maneuver if it wishes to maintain a wide interest rate differential in support of the rupiah a truce in the u s china trade war and significant progress on structural reforms though could reduce the risk premium needed to attract capital inflows tamara henderson central bank of turkey current 1 week repo rate 12 forecast for end of 2020 11 be forecast turkey s central bank may be about to find out the limits of its easing cycle next year when president recep tayyip erdogan says interest rates should fall to single digits while the inflation rate is expected to go up emboldened by the currency s stability in recent months the bank s monetary policy committee reduced its key rate a total of 12 percentage points exceeding all forecasts made six months ago now the return on the lira adjusted for inflation is barely on par with emerging market peers average it may prove extremely difficult for governor murat uysal to abide by his pledge to maintain a reasonable rate of return without upsetting the president who is adamant that inflation will continue to slow if the bank keeps slashing borrowing costs something that goes against accepted central bank assumptions what bloomberg s economists say the political pressure will be immense with the number of monetary policy committee meetings rising to 12 next year but the bank may be unable to deliver the president s orders high inflation will probably prevent rates from falling by more than 100 basis points although balance of risks is skewed toward deeper cuts ziad daoud central bank of nigeria current central bank rate 13 5 forecast for end of 2020 13 5 the nigerian central bank will continue its tight policy stance in 2020 as inflation expectations are picking up food prices have been rising due to supply constraints caused by a closure of land borders to stop smuggling while the central bank sees these moves as temporary governor godwin emefiele has said he would only consider rate cuts when inflation slows to the upper end of the target band of 6 to 9 it s been outside that range for more than four years keeping the monetary policy rate at 13 5 will also help support the naira which is under pressure due to dwindling reserves while the central bank is keen to boost economic growth in the continent s biggest oil producer it s likely to rather keep using non traditional policy tools such as raising lenders loan to deposit ratios to force them to give out credit and support private sector output bank of korea current base rate 1 25 forecast for end of 2020 1 25 the bank of korea is expecting a gradual economic recovery in 2020 as the effects of two rate cuts in the last six months and an expansionary budget feed through the economy and global demand picks up if the expected recovery fails to materialize governor lee ju yeol will face pressure to ease policy further though the central bank doesn t have much room for maneuver with the benchmark rate at a record low and household debt at a record high lee has said it s premature to consider the alternative of taking unconventional measures such as quantitative easing a majority of economists surveyed by bloomberg see the bok either holding rates steady at 1 25 or cutting once to 1 next year a handful expect two cuts or a hike what bloomberg s economists say cautious optimism on growth and continued concerns about financial risk point to a prolonged pause from the bank of korea in the year ahead governor lee ju yeol has reiterated that the central bank still has some policy space but fiscal policy will likely take the lead with another expansionary budget due for 2020 justin jimenez reserve bank of australia current cash rate target 0 75 forecast for end of 2020 0 25 the rba is closing in on its effective lower bound estimated by governor philip lowe as a cash rate of 0 25 when further monetary stimulus will require a shift to unorthodox policy lowe has suggested that while he doesn t expect to have to go the unconventional route if he did a version of qe would be his approach a consensus is emerging among australian economists that in the absence of fiscal stimulus which the government is resisting the rba is likely to have to turn to qe at some point growth is weak business and consumer sentiment soft and unemployment is expected to edge higher lowe a self confessed glass half full optimist argues the economy is at a gentle turning point so most analysts expect more of the same a weak economy requiring ongoing rba stimulus that s against a central bank that maintains the worst is over and the economy is likely to gradually improve in 2020 what bloomberg s economists say it s hard to see the australian cash rate going anywhere but lower in 2020 but once at the elb qe wouldn t come automatically the hurdle would be high whilst there s a strong turnaround in house prices in australia s two largest cities sydney and melbourne forward looking indicators on the labour market point to 2020 being a year where the rba takes the cash rate to the elb and guides that rates will be held there for a very long time james mcintyre central bank of argentina current rate floor 58 forecast for end of 2020 n a argentina s recently appointed central bank chief miguel pesce is facing a daunting task with an economy in crisis and an inflation rate of more than 50 he aims to slash price growth to single digit rates by the end of 2021 and says both monetary policy and a social accord proposed by president alberto fernandez s administration will be part of this fernandez only took office this month and during the campaign trail advisers said the central bank would seek to keep the argentine peso at relatively weak levels in a bid to boost exports and turn the economy around the strategy would require interventions in the foreign exchange market to control inflation the bank might seek to rein in monetary aggregates while the government tries to strike deals with the productive sector to keep prices stable what bloomberg s economists say the new government has a clear focus on growth and poverty relief and is very likely to use credit as a lever on that front in the meantime economy minister martin guzman has already hinted that capital controls will not be lifted at this time and that interest rates are not the only tool to fight inflation keeping the risk of price freeze in the air the bottom line seems to be that interest rates are about to fall both in nominal and even more so in real terms adriana dupita swiss national bank current libor target rate 0 75 forecast for end of 2020 0 75 with the euro area locked into an expansive stance the snb is all but sure to continue with its policy of subzero interest rates and pledge to wage interventions to stem appreciation pressure on the currency with switzerland s negative rate policy about to enter its fifth year opposition particularly from the banking sector is mounting yet inflation is barely about zero and snb president thomas jordan has stressed that moving off the rock bottom rates would increase pressure on the haven franc the snb adjusted its tiering system in 2019 in order to ease the pain from negative rates for the financial sector and also to enable another interest rate reduction if necessary sveriges riksbank current repo rate 0 forecast for end of 2020 0 sweden s central bank ended nearly half a decade of negative interest rates this month by raising its benchmark rate to zero but it will probably stay put throughout 2020 and possibly until 2022 according to its latest rate path the final months of 2019 have seen a determination from governor stefan ingves and his colleagues to put the ultra loose monetary policy experiment behind them that s despite the economy heading towards a slowdown and inflation stuck below the 2 target having earned the sadomonetarist epithet from nobel laureate paul krugman in 2014 for keeping rates too high the board is now risking similar controversy with its latest move what bloomberg s economists say after raising rates to zero the riksbank will be slow to make another move a fragile global outlook will dampen demand in export oriented sweden at the same time the domestic critique against negative rates has been fierce and that makes new cuts highly unlikely even if the economy worsens we expect the riksbank to stay on hold during the remainder of 2020 johanna jeansson norges bank current deposit rate 1 5 forecast for end of 2020 1 5 after four rate hikes since september 2018 norway s monetary policy is on hold for the foreseeable future yet norges bank surprised the market on dec 19 when it kept the door open for another raise next year governor oystein olsen rejects any notion that he s hawkish with a message that he expects a stable benchmark rate possibly for years but some economists had expected him to lower the probability of a hike in 2020 due to weaker than forecast prospects for the norwegian economy instead the bank kept that chance at 40 amid a weak krone and higher oil prices reserve bank of new zealand current cash rate 1 forecast for end of 2020 0 75 signs the new zealand economy may be turning a corner have prompted most economists to scale back expectations for further rbnz easing in 2020 to just one more cut that was reinforced when governor adrian orr announced new capital rules for banks that were less onerous than expected easing fears they could drive up borrowing costs and require an offset from monetary policy the government has also announced a fiscal spending package that may relieve pressure on the rbnz to do more to stimulate growth that said downside risks remain and with room for further rate cuts limited the central bank has said it will outline its unconventional policy options early next year just in case they re needed what bloomberg s economists say the new zealand dollar has appreciated since the november monetary policy statement and with robust commodity prices is likely to remain above the expectations the rbnz s factored into their outlook a further 25bp cut is likely in 2020 but from there rates are likely to be on hold for a considerable period james mcintyre national bank of poland current cash rate 1 5 forecast for end of 2020 1 5 with benchmark interest rates unchanged at a record low 1 5 since march 2015 poland is in the midst of its longest ever period of stable borrowing costs based on the central bank s comments the pause will extend for the foreseeable future despite hitting a six year high this year inflation remains within the central bank s tolerance range while growth of the european union s largest eastern economy is the slowest in three years thate conflicting forces reduce the chance for any shift in rates strengthening governor adam glapinski s long held position that staying put ensures balanced and persistent economic expansion early in december he noted that inflation will only slightly overshoot next year adding so i can only repeat that a change in rates either way isn t necessary czech national bank current cash rate 2 forecast for end of 2020 2 the czech central bank is among the few in europe still discussing whether to raise interest rates but it may end up keeping them where they are for another year after lifting the benchmark to a 10 year high in may the eighth increase since summer 2017 policy makers have stayed put some have called for tighter policy to curb above target inflation driven by the eu s lowest unemployment rate and the bank s own forecast implies two hikes by the end of march but the majority on the monetary panel has voted down several motions to raise rates saying the export oriented economy may be hit by weaker demand from key trading partners mainly germany and faces geopolitical risks like trade wars and brexit methodology based on median estimate in monthly or quarterly survey where available or most recent collected forecasts all interest rate and forecast data is as of dec 19 some surveys were conducted early december before latest policy decisions file image iol

the u s dollar s century long reign of the world economy faces a threat over the coming decade as china s renminbi strives to become its successor as some prominent central bankers call for a more sustainable global monetary regime and as cryptocurrencies pose a radically alternative model but as the 2020s begin the dollar looks as strong as ever in global capital markets as of dec 30 an index of the u s dollar s value is up 24 percent over the past decade even as the federal reserve pumped more than 2 trillion of freshly printed money into the financial system and u s national debt more than doubled to about 23 trillion related china may soon have its first blockchain exchange traded fund the greenback s share of central bank foreign exchange reserves stands at about 62 percent unchanged since jan 1 2010 according to the international monetary fund the second place euro touted by some leading economists in the late 2000s as a potential rival to the dollar saw its share of central bank reserves decline over the past decade to about 20 percent from 26 percent the japanese yen seen as a threat to the dollar in the 1980s now accounts for just 5 4 percent of central bank reserves the british pound which dominated global markets for a century until world war i has a modest share of 4 4 percent with its future uncertain as the u k moves toward an exit from the european union and china despite decades of rapid economic growth and a push by authorities there to expand the renminbi s use in international trade and payments has never seen its currency account for more than 2 percent of central banks reserves as for digital assets frequently touted as the future of money they barely register as an asset class compared with government issued currencies bitcoin s entire market value stands at about 133 billion well below central banks de minimis 218 billion allocation to the renminbi signs of decline the dollar s dominance is under attack though as a growing number of economists and world leaders say the international monetary and financial system looks unsustainable or simply unfair story continues related the bahamas launches digital currency pilot u s consumers benefit disproportionately from the dollar s strength since foreigners are essentially subsidizing americans habit of importing more than they export also global demand for dollar denominated assets helps keep interest rates low on things like treasury bonds despite a u s federal budget deficit of more than 1 trillion a year that dynamic encourages governments businesses and households to take on ever growing amounts of debt which might be difficult to pay back if borrowing costs suddenly jumped thus far the dollar has defied decades of predictions that its demise might be at hand it s like the shepherd crying wolf said martin baily a senior fellow in economic studies at brookings institution who served during the late 1990s as chairman of president bill clinton s council of economic advisers unfortunately sometimes the wolf does come few events of the past year encapsulated the glaring contrast between the dollar s solidifying position and the ever louder calls for change than a speech in august by bank of england governor mark carney an oxford university trained economist carney is widely followed among top monetary experts because he previously served both as head of canada s central bank and as a former executive of the wall street firm goldman sachs invited as a guest speaker to an annual federal reserve retreat in wyoming carney told the u s central bankers the dollar s dominant status contributes not just to instability in emerging market countries but also to a global savings glut that has helped push interest rates artificially low the speech piled onto the worries for fed chair jerome powell already facing caustic criticism from president donald trump for setting interest rates too high past instances of very low rates have tended to coincide with high risk events such as wars financial crises and breaks in the monetary regime carney said left unattended these vulnerabilities are only likely to intensify the solution according to carney the international monetary system might benefit from an alternative to the dollar such as a synthetic hegemonic currency potentially provided through a network of central bank digital currencies the concept is intriguing carney said technology has the potential to disrupt the network externalities that prevent the incumbent global reserve currency from being displaced jens nordviq a former co head of currency strategy for goldman sachs and now ceo of the data provider exante says the fact that very prominent people like carney are seriously discussing the concept shows that it s not a farfetched idea a century of domination the dollar emerged as the world s dominant currency during the early 20th century when it took over from debt strapped britain s pound a century before that holland s guilder was undone by the french emperor napoleon s invasion today the dollar is ubiquitous as ever banks around the world stockpile dollars so they can meet demand from local businesses and residents for the currency to use in commerce and payments central banks stockpile dollars and dollar denominated assets like u s treasury bonds so they can meet the needs of local banks for well dollars cross border bank loans denominated in dollars garnered a world leading 14 percent share of the total in 2018 from 9 5 percent a decade earlier according to the bank of international settlements u s treasury bonds comprise the world s biggest government bond market by far valued at about 17 trillion and growing major global commodities like oil and gold are priced in dollars there is no other asset market as deep or liquid as the dollar asset market said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein a 592 billion u s money manager bitcoin too is generally quoted in dollars along with a growing roster of digital stablecoins whose value is linked to the u s currency facebook s proposed digital asset libra would reportedly be 50 percent backed by dollars even china s planned digital renminbi reportedly part of an effort to unseat the dollar s dominance might just trade like a dollar proxy that s because at least for now authorities peg the renminbi s value to an index of major currencies dominated by the u s dollar the renminbi is at this point not really in the running said edwin truman a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics who oversaw the federal reserve s division of international finance from the late 1970s through the late 1990s the chinese seem to be pushing it as a denomination for trade but that s largely a push rather than a pull of the market after u s economic output caught up with britain s in the early 20th century it still took two and a half more decades for the dollar to definitively replace the pound as the reserve currency of choice harvard university economist jeffrey frankel has attributed the lag to inertia essentially the cost and bother of changing routine payment methods and rewriting legal contracts there s a lot of discussion of substitutes for the dollar as the global reserve currency said bill adams senior international economist for the u s bank pnc but the lesson of the last 10 years is that at least to me it s easier said than done related stories

workers of the world 2020 will be the year for the victory of the palestinians in their fight for an independent state news line congratulates the people of venezuela who for the past year have fought off all attempts by us imperialism to carry out a coup against the legal government of president nicolas maduro despite enduring vicious sanctions imposed by the us far from being all powerful imperialism has been unable to re conquer the world and is instead being torn apart by divisions that have emerged between the main imperialist powers 2019 saw the imperialist war machine nato at war with itself with french president macron declaring it was brain dead the fight over libya s oil wealth has seen two nato members france and turkey come to blows signalling the beginning of the end for imperialist alliances such as nato that have hitherto been viewed as essential to the stability and survival of world capitalism the driving force behind the breakup of the old alliances is the revolutionary upsurge amongst the working class and masses of the world bringing the historic crisis of capitalism ie its death agony to the fore this crisis first broke the surface in 2008 in the form of a worldwide banking crash a crash that the central banks and governments desperately tried to stave off through printing trillions of worthless money and handing it to the banks along with a near zero interest rates on loans the effect of this was to create a mountain of debt global debt has reached a staggering 255 trillion 197 trillion at the end of 2019 after already hitting a record high according to the institute of international finance the international monetary fund in october issued another of its dire warnings of a 19 trillion corporate debt time bomb that threatened to worsen the next recession it predicted that in eight major economies including the uk s that debt at risk the amount owed by companies which cannot cover interest payments with profits would hit levels higher than those at the height of the 2008 financial crisis and that 40 of corporations in eight major economies faced bankruptcy as a result capitalism is bankrupt and is only surviving by piling on massive debt worldwide while manufacturing industry internationally is collapsing with the once mighty car manufacturers leading the way giant car companies like ford volkswagen and toyota are all restructuring across the globe closing down factories and laying off millions of workers as the world enters a slump exceeding that of the 1930s huge us corporations produce barely enough profit to pay the interest on the billion dollar loans they have taken out to keep their share prices sky high and justify the millions of dollars paid to shareholders and their bosses these are the zombie companies that exist entirely through accumulating debt so great is this crisis that in november the international credit agency moody s predicted that europe in 2020 would be hit by a wave of debt defaults after a surge in junk related companies companies whose economic performance is worthless junk this collapse of manufacturing will rebound on the banks that have financed this debt explosion with a recent global banking review reporting that the majority of banks worldwide may not be economically viable and will not survive any economic downturn it is under these conditions of economic collapse that us capitalism is seeking to survive by making war on its capitalist rivals with attempts to re conquer and loot the wealth of other nations through imperialist wars and regime changes while simultaneously waging war at home by making workers and the poor pay for the crisis through the most savage austerity cuts this has produced the revolutionary upsurge worldwide of workers young people and the poor who can no longer live under a capitalist system that destroys their lives so that the bankers and bosses can live in luxury in france this revolutionary struggle is being forcibly expressed in the struggle of french workers and youth in the general strikes that have gripped the country in the dying days of 2019 and which will develop into outright insurrection in the new year it started with the yellow vests protests initially over fuel increases protests that president macron the bankers president as he is known boasted he would crush with the use of the brutal riot police crs not only did he fail to crush the protests but they were joined in december by the full might of the french trade unions who called a general strike against macron s proposed changes in french pensions that would drive up retirement age while drastically cutting their pensions this strike is revolutionary it has demonstrated the huge power of french workers and closed down major cities it has a power that all the force of the french state cannot contain 2020 will be the year in which french workers will bring down macron but must then go forward to take the power to carry out this task french workers must build a french section of the fourth international capable of organising the successful struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat in france in britain the working class has entered into a period of intense revolutionary class conflict with strikes on the rail system mass strikes by doctors and nurses in the north of ireland plus the developing national postal workers strike this intensification of the class struggle in britain takes place after the massive defeat of the labour party in the december 12 general election in which labour committed harikari by embracing the eu and a second referendum rather than win a brexit election on the shoulders of the masses and go forward to socialism corbyn and co committed political suicide the labour party underestimated the determination of workers to see brexit through and force a break with the eu workers who had voted for brexit in 2016 refused to support the labour party with all its posturing about second referendums to disguise their determination to remain in the eu workers in the safest labour seats voted for johnson on the basis that the uk has to leave the eu on january 31 immediately on taking office after the election johnson ditched all pretence at leading a one nation government the queen s speech outlining the priorities for the tories including a pledge to introduce new laws to make all out strikes in the public sector illegal this attempt to drive the trade union movement back to the days of the 19th century and illegality will inevitably lead to an explosive confrontation workers will not sit back and see the tories destroy the unions and the right to strike rights they fought for and won in the past and which they will fight to the end to defend 2020 will be the year in which the british working class and its unions will take action by calling a general strike like their french counterparts to bring down the tory government and bring in a workers government that will leave the eu expropriate the bosses and bankers and place the banks and major industries under workers management the day of labour party reformism is over destroyed in the 2019 election the working class and their unions have entered a revolutionary confrontation with the tories and british capitalism where the urgent task is to grasp this historic opportunity by rapidly building up the revolutionary leadership of the wrp to lead the working class and trade unions to take the power and establish socialism in the uk uk workers will join with the workers in france german and italy and across europe to bring down the bosses and bankers eu and replace it with the socialist united states of europe in this revolutionary struggle the workers of europe will have the support of the working class and oppressed masses throughout the world in the us the most powerful capitalist nation the working class is also taking the road of revolution under the impact of a world crisis that has devastated the lives of millions of americans trump may boast that the us economy is strong and unemployment is at a record low but the reality is the only thing expanding is the stock market which is recording highs while companies are going bust entire industries closing in a crisis intensified by his trade war with the rest of the world as the imf warns this debt bubble will soon explode destroying the banks and industry ushering in the worst crash in the history of capitalism while trump boasts of making america great the harsh reality is that millions of americans are being driven into the gutter and face starvation today two years ago trump handed out 1 5 trillion of taxpayers money in a massive tax giveaway to corporations and the rich just before this christmas trump announced that the price for this handout would be paid for by the most deprived sections of the us when he promised to strip 3 7 million people of their nutritional benefits food stamps that millions rely on to feed themselves and their families are to be abolished along with this is trump s attempt to repeal the us affordable care act which will kick 32 million off health insurance and leave them incapable of affording any medical treatment all the jobs trump boasts of creating turn out to be the typical low paid insecure gig economy jobs that leave workers scrabbling to survive on starvation levels of pay us workers are rising up in hatred at a system that protects the rich and imposes policies designed to keep people hungry so they will work harder in 2019 us workers engaged in unprecedented strike actions including a 6 week national strike by over 48 000 united auto workers members against general motors venting their anger at a system that demands sacrifices from workers while at the same time handing trillions over to the filthy rich and large corporations with the two main parties of the us bourgeoisie republicans and democrats tearing each other apart over how best to deal with the working class and their economic rivals there has never been a better opportunity for the working class to demand the trade unions break with the parties of the bourgeoisie and form a labour party in the us to fight for the working class it must also build a us section of the fourth international to lead the struggle to smash world capitalism in its main citadel the usa above all in the us europe and throughout the world the historic task confronting workers youth and the poor is building sections of the international committee of the fourth international in every country to lead the victory of the world socialist revolution this movement will create the conditions where the russian and chinese workers free from imperialist war threats will be able to remove the remnants of the ruling stalinist bureaucracy and bring in workers democracy that is rule through workers soviets 2020 will be the year for the workers of the world and their allies amongst the masses to go forward to put this bankrupt capitalist system out of its misery by overthrowing it with socialist revolutions 2020 will be the year for building parties of the fourth international throughout the world to lead the world socialist revolution to its victory there is not a moment to lose
as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect of broader forces at work as it was a cause of these movements and moments that reshaped the economy over the last 10 years eurozone in crisis in the wake of the recession unsustainably high deficit and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to and a catalyst of britain s 2016 vote to leave the eurozone brexit is kind of the natural outcome of when greece was basically held hostage said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network they were forced into a multi year depression in order to save the euro obviously brexit opens up the possibility more concretely that european countries can leave their union and i m sure that s going to have all kinds of ramifications said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics with nationalism growing in prominence he predicted that the eurozone will face a continuation of these challenges in the coming decade nationalism hits trade the 2010s were marked more broadly by a surge of populist and nationalist sentiment both in the u s and elsewhere around the world a sentiment that is fundamentally reshaping trade between countries and changing the calculus for multinational corporations we ve seen this rise of nationalism which is a political issue reshaping financial markets tremendously said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management for roughly half a century business and industry labored to build manufacturing and production facilities and supply chains to take advantage of the availability of raw materials cheap labor and lax environmental regulations all in a relentless drive for efficiency now that commercial infrastructure is under strain trump s decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership and start a trade war with china is the most visible and consequential manifestation of this trend with his on again off again threats to impose tariffs on europe mexico and other trading partners a close second politics is now taking primacy over economics over the past several decades we ve been building an economically optimized world right now that is no longer the case mcmillan said political economy is now being prioritized over economic efficiency and that s something we haven t seen for decades that takes us back to the 50s fed intervenes to prop up the economy in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve initiated monetary policy with little precedent in modern times it held interest rates at zero for an extended period of time and undertook enormous quantitative easing programs to pump liquidity into financial markets the decade was really remarkable in the sense that for the first six years of the decade we had zero percent interest rates and for the first five years we had quantitative easing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america characterizing the central bank s activities as a wild monetary policy experiment some market observers defend the fed s interventionist streak particularly at the start of the decade with the financial crisis still fresh in people s minds the biggest thing in the last 10 years is the continuation of quantitative easing without quantitative easing i think everything would be drastically different way worse than things are now said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy in hindsight some question whether the fed was too accommodative a stance that could have ramifications for the next recession when the fed cut interest rates to the unprecedented level of zero to 0 25 percent nobody expected it was going to last the seven years that it did mcbride said we ve had way too much easy money for way too long and at some point it s going to come back and get us north said this leaves the fed with fewer tools at hand to boost the economy he said we re leaving very little room for the next recession tax cuts lead to buybacks republicans sweep of the 2016 election facilitated the passage of a massive corporate tax cut financial experts say the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of 2017 had positive results initially but those short term gains could come at the cost of long term pain trump got elected and went on a path of reducing regulation north said i think honestly the reduction in regulation has helped the economy and i think the tax cut helped the economy as well he said but he added that since economic growth fell far short of republicans forecasts the stimulative effects of the tax cut have faded and the national debt has ballooned a risky combination it s putting america on a less stable financial future because of the structure of this unfunded non sustainable tax cut crowley said proponents of the the tax cuts predicted that companies would spend their windfalls expanding and investing in production facilities technology and human capital instead the cuts spurred a wave of corporate stock buybacks which helped propel the market to new record highs but also potentially limited the broader impact the tax cuts were intended to have it s in part a reflection of the fact that there may be in some sectors more than others limited investment or acquisition opportunities or a lack of appealing valuations on those that make a buyback a more palatable way to boost earnings per share said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com every dollar that s going into buybacks is a dollar that s not being used for another form of expansion he said share repurchases have also contributed to stock valuation gains but investing experts warn that this inflation can distort markets more dollars chasing fewer stocks because of all the buybacks isn t something you want long term investors to hang their hat on said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial stock market highs the increase in buybacks is one factor that has contributed to the record long bull market a meteoric rise virtually no one would have predicted 10 years ago when 2010 began the stock market had already begun the long climb out of its recession era hole but the mood was still pessimistic the decade started off very ominously zandi said we began the decade not knowing that the crisis was over we d just suffered the worst economic downturn since the 1930s depression the recession was over officially by june 2009 but it wasn t quite clear that we were out of it since then of course stocks have smashed through one record high after another with valuations boosted by both monetary and fiscal policy mcbride said the fed s trio of rate cuts in 2019 reversed the correction that took place at the end of last year sustaining the bull market for a record setting 10th year that helped cushion the broader economy but it s also helped juiced the equity markets lower interest rates make other investments less appealing he said that enhances the appeal of equities relative to bonds or cash
this article is more than 4 years old anadolu agency getty images global investors tend to group kazakhstan along with russia and the commonwealth of independent states cis but its market fundamentals are markedly different and they appear to offer some interesting investment opportunities going into 2020 first and foremost the government has been pursuing a privatization program that aims to raise 7 billion by selling stakes in around 900 companies the world s largest landlocked country is taking a page from the playbook of margaret thatcher the u k s former prime minister who saw privatization as fundamental to improving britain s economic performance meanwhile the countries of central asia are in talks to create something along the same lines as asean the nordic council the visegrád group for central european states or mercosur for south america on november 29 kazakhstan s first president nursultan nazarbayev joined with the leaders of tajikistan turkmenistan and the kyrgyz republic to declare that they would work toward joint development and cooperation in areas that range from economic trade and investment to infrastructure tourism science and culture positive developments like these are winning plaudits kazakhstan jumped eight positions to reach no 28 in the world bank group s doing business 2019 report that ranks the world s top economies for their ease of doing business kazakhstan s ranking places it ahead of no 30 spain no 46 china and no 77 india and kazakhstan isn t alone neighboring uzbekistan which is ranked no 76 in the same rankings and has recently opened up for foreign investment looks set to spur a healthy rivalry in central asia that will potentially boost the economy of kazakhstan according to the international monetary fund the competition will make both countries policymakers work harder to further improve transparency their policy frameworks and business environment the recently held almaty investment forum aimed to firmly position almaty and kazakhstan as the center of central asia s economic development kazakhstan s policymaker hope to make the country s largest city almaty into a significant transport logistics and tourism hub on the new silk road this year s forum saw 31 agreements worth 2 3 billion signed between various government agencies and the business community in late november global air connectivity will be ever more important for central asia and as such the turkish airport operator tav submitted a non binding bid to buy kazakhstan s almaty airport in a joint venture with goldman sachs international tav plans to invest 165 million in almaty international airport in the coming years the investment will significantly increase the capabilities of the airport adding one million additional passengers and creating 3 000 jobs global food giant tyson foods has announced an investment to produce beef in kazakhstan which shares a border with china chinese tariffs on kazakh meat are 12 the u s is the world s largest beef producer but sales to china have been disadvantaged since beijing imposed a 25 retaliatory tariff bringing the total levy to 37 although the economy is expected to grow another 3 4 in 2020 according to a forecast from the economist intelligence unit many investors still overlook kazakhstan s solid investment fundamentals due to its credit ratings the country s long term foreign debt rating was affirmed by moody s in august at baa3 the lowest investment grade score foreign issuer rating was affirmed by moody s at baa3 the lowest investment grade score the project that is probably having the greatest impact in shifting global investor perception has been the astana international financial centre aifc established on july 5 2018 the aifc is a financial hub based in kazakhstan s capital nur sultan city for the countries of central asia the caucasus and the eurasian economic union eaeu anadolu agency getty images the aifc also aims to be a financing platform for the belt and road initiative the aifc already has partnerships with the shanghai stock exchange and nasdaq in place and seeks to incentivize participants by exempting them from corporate taxes for the income received from providing financial and ancillary services as well as from capital gains until 2066 furthermore their employees will also be similarly exempted from individual income tax kazakhstan also plans to offer investment residency status to foreigners investing at least 60 000 into equities at the astana international financial center s stock exchange the center s governor kairat kelimbetov told bloomberg news recently investors will be guaranteed a five year multi entry visa the measure aimed at nationals from the former soviet union republics and middle east is expected to raise kzt100b over 250 million within the five years of the start of the program kazakhstan s real interest rates are expected to remain relatively attractive in the near term with the national bank of kazakhstan s base rate at 9 25 and an expected slowdown in inflation to the mid range of the 4 to 6 target corridor throughout 2020 kazakhstan is certainly a value investment at the moment kase kazakhstan stock exchange trades at a price earnings ratio of 6 44 a dividend yield of 3 73 and a price to book of 0 9 in comparison the msci world equities index trades at a p e ratio of 20 04 and

steven yates never let hard lessons harden your heart the hard lessons of life are meant to make you better not bitter roy t bennett the light in the heart as i write this there are under two weeks left of the 10s time to take stock what all has happened what did we accomplish these past ten years have we learned anything a french philosopher alain de botton once said anyone who isn t embarrassed at who they were last year probably isn t learning enough how about who you were ten years ago oh my if readers will indulge me i ll say a little of where i was at the start of this decade and the takeaways that have left me in a vastly different place than i was in at the end of 2009 as i m the worst current events junkie my experiences and thoughts will mirror events we ve all witnessed in a world now in a far different place from where it was ten years ago i hope this won t be seen as self indulgent i want to help readers see truths we will need in the decade ahead even if some are uncomfortable or barbecue a few sacred cows the present decade started for me on a sad note my father had just passed away dec 23 2009 william c yates jr was 86 he d died in his sleep which some say is the best way to go i d gotten the phone call every son dreads at 4 10 am my mother alice m yates would pass away peacefully roughly 16 months later 1 30 am apr 14 2011 she was 87 i was at her bedside holding her hand the entire time the world changes qualitatively when your parents are no longer in it my takeaways are personal but applicable scripture says honor your father and your mother ex 20 12 those aren t just words if you have aging parents honor them by recognizing they ve had experiences you haven t had yet learn from them spend time with them share with them appreciate them even if they are imperfect as all of us are whatever your line of work is do it to the best of your ability not simply for the money but to make them proud many elderly people are living vicariously through their grown children because they have little else to look forward to listen to this try to see things from their point of view one observation i made during my parents final months getting round the clock nursing care was how many elderly people around them had family members sometimes in other states but sometimes not who d simply abandoned them some were very lonely delight at talking to us was written all over their faces maybe their grown offspring believed paying for assisted living or nursing home expenses was sufficient or leaving it up to medicare abandonment of elderly parents by adult children who have the means to make regular visits seems to me immoral if you re aliened from your parents or other elderly relatives fix the problem while you can always remember when your parents are gone they re gone time not spent with them is time you ll never get back late in 2011 i published four cardinal errors reasons for the decline of the american republic i went through a small collective we amusingly called it consisting of two south carolina women and myself the name brush fire press international was mine i wanted to avoid the self publishing stigma while learning how such platforms work but we never got a website done nor a promotional video made and these probably hurt the book s credibility none of us had any marketing budget moreover and if i learned anything from that experience it s 1 people weren t going to come to me i had to figure out how to market the book with what resources i had and 2 i didn t know beans how to market a book with or without a budget this was during a period when the number of self publishing platforms was exploding many self published books are short run tracts intended for very specific audiences that noted the blunt truth is that plenty of others aimed at john q public begin at mediocre and go downhill from there a few of course are sacred cow barbecuing standouts that might never have seen the light of day if mainstream publishers were the only outlet i had to find a way to stand out to prove mine wasn t mediocre i had no idea how to do this how to reach out and get endorsements which is why there are none on the cover or on the inside front matter and just four five star reviews on amazon two of them one sentence fragment long yes people do read those two draft copies sent to a particular person who might have endorsed it mysteriously vanished to the best of my knowledge his secretary and i double checked the address they never did turn up there are more books published today then ever before there is more information flying around than anyone anywhere has ever seen we are in a period of information overload sometimes i think this is purposeful other times i don t sometimes after all a cigar is just a cigar and information overload may be nothing more than an effect of the kind of society we have now an empire with the most advanced technology anyone has ever seen ways of using it never before seen and frenetically busy people who make time to write books and ebooks the biggest change in my life was moving to a foreign country in 2012 chile where i took up residence in santiago the capitol i ve learned a lot and wouldn t trade this knowledge for anything some of my observations have been about language the official language of chile being spanish and i won t wax at length about those here except to say i will never take english for granted again a pure romance language such as spanish has a consistency english lacks letters of the alphabet tend to be pronounced the same english pronunciation is all over the map at least at first glance the best way to appreciate this is to observe spanish speakers struggling to pronounce english there has been a push for chileans most of it coming from big business to learn english english is the language of global business of course in our hemisphere at least after a couple of decades less than five percent of chileans are fluent in english it s taught in schools but badly most don t have much reason to learn it you could say i was open to alternatives to a teaching career that was going nowhere probably everybody knows that books issued by microscopic presses developing conservative themes are useless in advancing a teaching career in the u s academia as a whole seemed to me on a long downhill slide i ve written about this numerous times subsequent events proved that judgment correct campuses exploded in 2014 the most proximate cause being the michael brown shooting in ferguson missouri black lives matter rose to visibility such movements rejected responses such as all lives matter as covert racism i guessed lives with white privilege didn t matter the old and all too familiar reversal rationalized with charges of false equivalence with identity politics the new orthodoxy on major campuses and in the culture generally alongside a growing obsession with sexual minorities those of us who considered it the worst thing since positivism saw an academic world with a limited future a place of division and hostility to free dialogue increasingly irrelevant and useless at diagnosing the real problems of our era the 10s have been an era of collapsing narratives technology made this possible when bill clinton signed the 1996 telecommunications act around 90 percent of mainstream media came under the ownership of six corporate leviathans the leviathans did not own the internet which became fundamentally disruptive we saw its potential when in 98 drudge broke clinton lewinsky ahead of the leviathans who loved the corrupt clintons and might have buried the story alternative commentary sites including this one became places of refuge for those of us who had no chance at getting syndicated columns since our ideas ran counter to what served the global corporate state fast forward to now during the intervening years the mostly free flow of information online had exposed the corporate state s lies be they about globalization foreign wars and much else support for professional politicians fell and donald j trump stepped into the spotlight at first i didn t take the donald seriously i briefly entertained the idea that he might be colluding with the treacherous clintons to destroy the republican party trump had been a democrat at one time moving in some of the same circles as bill and hillary he d attended chelsea s wedding no evidence for such collusion emerged and i dropped it and given how trump comported himself in the debates how he stood out against a crowded field of insipid mediocrities and handled allegations thrown at him by the megyn kellys of the corporate media world with remarks like we don t have time to be politically correct i paid attention trump correctly described u s foreign policy as a complete and total disaster i d thought all along that the iraq war was the dumbest and most destructive policy decision any corrupt bush had ever made trump appeared during a time when those getting their news from alternative sources had hit a crescendo the republican base did not believe straight white christian males were history s villains they were divided about whether the u s military should police the world but at least there was healthy skepticism a large swath of the public doubted the official 9 11 narrative they d peered behind the curtain swallowed the red pill however you put it the word globalism had crept from conspiracy sites into general discourse the idea of a corrupt globalist elite planning a technocratic world government had gained ground an increasing number of those left behind by globalization moreover questioned its narrative of economic benefits they didn t see any and it had never seemed realistic to expect degreeless former manufacturing workers in their 50s to reinvent themselves as software designers or online entrepreneurs selling apps those hillary clinton would stupidly call deplorables had every reason to support someone promising to stop the outsourcing of jobs to cheap labor countries as well as the insourcing of migrants willing to work for corporations for a pittance so ceos could line their pockets the year 2014 had seen the appearance of french economist thomas piketty s capital in the 21st century i ve not read the book so i neither promote it nor pan it what i ve read about it seems like a rorschach test when it came out free marketers saw it as another quasi marxist attack on capitalism sympathizers noted how it drew attention to something that was is undoubtedly real economic inequality the world over was is increasing the increases were are accelerating ten years ago the libertarian in me wouldn t have been bothered by this the financial elite centered in banking titans like goldman sachs was reaping windfalls from a recovery that had created two economies the visible one of wall street and silicon valley the other of main street and flyover country the latter were mostly ignored by the elite owned mainstream which also ignored the millions of people considered not in the labor force and hence not counted as unemployed in the official u 3 bls number with republican mainstream narratives on trade open borders and unemployment having collapsed outside urban enclaves and elite mouthpieces and with donald trump s vastly superior command of all media including social media there was no stopping him from wresting the nomination from the ownership class s fair haired boys jeb bush was their initial favorite the democrats faced their own elite vs populist divide between the clinton machine and a grassroots that favored bernie sanders the former brazenly stole their 2016 nomination with superdelegates with the corporate state and mainstream media solidly on hillary s side debate moderators didn t even try to disguise their bias the 2016 election was hers to lose and she did as the deplorables pulled levers in sufficient numbers in key states to give put trump in the white house the establishment has been trying to nullify the 2016 election ever since it began with its russian collusion narrative which fell apart following a two year circus act now it s ukraine gate based entirely on a loose interpretation of a couple of sentences exchanged between trump and ukraine president volodymyr zelensky what should be clear is that the corporate state and its owners are still very much running things sadly candidate trump and president trump have proved to be two largely different people as i ve observed before i don t think the former understood the magnitude of what he d taken on he compromised to survive in a resolutely hostile environment and out of that compromise came the latter meanwhile returning to the inequality issue the extremely rich are still getting extremely richer gaming the same systems they could even credit president trump whose 2017 tax cut allowed them to buy back their own stock and drive the dow into the stratosphere the swamp meanwhile is as deep and wide as ever the afghanistan quagmire continues the war machine is bogged down however it seems substantially weakened earlier this year it was unable to engineer a coup against maduro in venezuela in its back yard trump recently became the third u s president to be impeached and the first to be impeached while planning a reelection campaign i keep encountering claims that he was never more than controlled opposition while i m reluctant to dismiss such claims out of hand his commerce secretary wilbur ross does have rothschild connections after all i find it hard to believe that the deep establishment would go to the lengths it has gone against someone they didn t perceive as an existential threat disrupting their plans again sometimes a cigar is just a cigar and i doubt we would have seen the not so subtle effort to control the online world this began in november 2016 with the infamous unsourced and evidence free propornot allegations of russian propaganda in the elite controlled washington post this was the first shot fired in the war on fake news i e alternatives to the dying mainstream narratives big tech began consolidating technology based dominance examples google changing its search algorithms to reduce access to so called conspiracy sites censorship on google owned youtube where the prolife themed film unplanned was recently taken down illustrating big tech s dislike of conservative voices deplatforming people like alex jones bans on twitter and facebook and other signs that the elites were working overtime at narrative control the war on alternative news sources continues it is sometimes a personal war against those who have exposed real and sometimes deadly fakery of deep establishment war machine actions as with the persecution of julian assange intended to serve as an example among the things that should have hit home during the 10s is how little truth matters to the deep establishment or to its pawns in dominant political parties across the western world or in well heeled think tanks or its corporate media mouthpieces what matters are the only two things that matter in materialistic cultures money and power this is the real source of the post truth mindset money of course is power to the elites your value as a person is proportional to your purchasing power wallet bank accounts credit cards assets such as real estate here comes the skewering of sacred cows we are beyond capitalism and socialism the debate between them is theater because the power elites are neither capitalists in any standard sense of that term nor are left populists such as sanders and ocasio cortez really socialists unless their plan is to abolish the private sector as opposed to taxing and regulating it socialism meant abolition of private property back when words had fixed meanings they may be social democrats not the same thing yes the ownership class is the class of capital which today consists of accumulated financial digits exceeding the actual physical wealth on the planet which they use to control governments as they ve done since before soviet union collapsed result conditions for free markets such as unrepayable loans to governments privatization i e the selling of public assets to corporations austerity for the masses etc you could call this socialism for the superrich and capitalism for the middle classes and the poor i suppose those who have tried to resist this system have paid for it with a descent into poverty ask the greeks its called neoliberalism a word that wasn t in my vocabulary ten years ago what is neoliberalism exactly it s been called capitalism with the gloves off perfect for a materialist world but that s not quite it it s about power and privilege for the few while the masses are encircled by and struggling within a money economy encouraging irresponsible consumption and debt it has spread across the world because growth is a condition of its existence it is beloved of many economists who point to its supposed benefits in terms of massive construction projects gdp growth etc is neoliberalism voluntary though when local agrarian economies not based on monetary transactions are destroyed so that declining to participate sinks you into deprivation is it strictly speaking correct to say that neoliberalism has raised prosperity all over the world when monetization is its sole standard local systems are gone and swallowed populations are induced to spend on credit i e go into debt this is the system that began to be imposed on chile during the pinochet years and which has been credited with creating the chilean miracle the chicago boys having studied under neoliberal founding father milton friedman brought it here chile came to be described as the most prosperous and stable of any latin american nation and when i arrived in 2012 it definitely seemed to be such descriptions lured many expats here some have now returned home or are contemplating doing so given how the neoliberal narrative in chile has crumbled since october defenders of the status quo blame communist influence and there has certainly been some of that they can point to the hundreds of stores and public facilities destroyed by hooligans many clearly influenced by forces from outside over 100 000 jobs have been lost or destroyed capital flight has badly damaged chile the central bank has struggled to stabilize the peso against the dollar moneyed investors do not like political instability and this is how sincere demands for reform are systemically punished chile had become the most unequal of latin american nations roughly 15 elite families control the country answering to outside influences no less than local communists the average wage in chile is less than 700 month the private pension system has been blatantly ripping chileans off for years a chilean friend walked me through the math chileans have faced the same things u s residents have faced for going on 30 years now a rising cost of living rising costs of food housing utilities gasoline health care education etc with no compensating rise in wages what we should be learning what i ve learned during this ten year period is that whatever moral arguments we might make corruption and worsening inequality are fundamentally destabilizing again once everyone is online knows about it and can share information about it sometimes internationally a new chilean constitution is now on the horizon sadly there are no james madisons here not that those exist elsewhere chile s overthrow of neoliberalism without anything to replace it constructively leaves the country s future in peril i don t think such observations make a person a communist or sympathetic with communism although i have come to the realization there is an intelligent economic left with something to say about structural elements at work in advanced civilizations neoliberal political economy automatically funnels wealth into the hands of a tiny elite while serving some interests of a small cooperative middle class that adopts its value system making money is the end all be all of human existence it furthers globalist interests no less and probably more than any preceding system masquerading as prosperity promoting especially when much of the prosperity would be impossible without a population willing to go into debt to sustain it making a better chile will mean scrapping the dominant neoliberal ideology and embracing some social safety nets free market absolutists notwithstanding again no this is not some sort of soft communism it is human nature it may just be human nature to resent those who are better off economically you can criticize this all you want but there it is and economics lectures aren t going to change a response that is fundamentally emotional whatever the case may be about what nietzsche excoriated as ressentiment it surely is a righteous human response when a tiny empowered elite invariably tied to globalism cleverly games systems of their own devising at the expense of everyone else without giving back anything in return globalism of course stands behind the rising tide of inequality all over the world a kind of neo nationalism or populism if you prefer has been the response of peoples all over the world when they are allowed to speak at the ballot box if we have a crisis of democracy as it is sometimes called in elite controlled presses maybe it is because we haven t seen much real democracy as opposed to plutocratic oligarchy passed off as democracy simply because rigged elections can be held between two or more vetted candidates returning to the personal unquestionably the biggest plus for me of being in chile was meeting my wife to be a chilean woman whose devotion to building a solid relationship on christian values has been total even if her christianity came filtered through a hazy and lukewarm upbringing in a family of mostly nonpracticing catholics there are two distinct marriage ceremonies in chile civil and ecclesiastical for those that want the latter our civil matrimony was aug 1 2014 our church wedding was nov 22 that same year in some respects the whole thing was literally miraculous my spanish was shoddy her english was almost nonexistent we ve both picked up a lot of key words and phrases of each other s language obviously our backgrounds were very different mine was academic i was a writer she d had to drop out of college when due to her father s passing away unexpectedly suddenly there was no money she never went back i m a schedules obsessed introvert her personality and way of working is quite opposite and yet we clicked it was as if an outside force cemented us together maybe one did within four months were inseparable i think what made me realize that this was for real was the week in august 2013 i was in bed sicker than a dog with a virus she made a six hour bus ride from her hometown somehow persuaded the security people to let her into my apartment after which she got me to a doctor then she cleaned my apartment from stem to stern having nursed me back to health two weeks later i asked her quieres ser mi novia translation from chilean spanish do you want to be my fiancée not that the ensuing months were smooth sailing there were times when neither of us thought we would make it but we did we are of course still married and should i return to the u s she will be at my side learning english as i continue my spanish studies we could conceivably serve as liaisons between the two kinds of communities anglo ones and hispanics during a period the coming 20s when such liaisons will be imperative this may be god s plan for us for another huge upside to living in a foreign country and interacting with locals at all levels is actual exposure to other cultures seeing them from the inside even if through gringo tinted glasses one of the things i learned is that chileans are considerably friendlier to estadounidenses spanish for a u s citizen than the latter are to spanish immigrants in the u s many of whom are just there to work and have fled bad situations in their homelands situations often caused by the bully to the north not all are from mexico when my wife and i were in the u s in 2015 we met spanish speakers from guatemala and honduras latin americans i ve learned are more diverse than english speakers in retrospect trump was not fair to them at all when he called them criminals and rapists singling out a few atypical cases he was of course talking to his base his base like everyone at times gets some things wrong many latinos are decent and loving people who deserve half a chance as opposed as i remain to the idea of globalism as leading inevitably to world government what i ve learned over the past seven and a half going on eight years is the value of internationalizing one s mind and thoughts it s a big and very diverse world out here and i m not using that word as the politically correct use it out here peoples are too busy just solving workaday problems to worry about what bad old white guys are doing at the same time they d prefer to live their lives without constant outside interference the fundamental problem with world government is that peoples are too different from one another to live under it voluntarily such an entity could not be anything other than a surveillance police state based on economic coercion and when that fails brute force prison populations would swell beyond what they are now the difference is between vertical arrangements that are created and imposed from the top down products of unwanted interference and horizontal and lateral ones that come out through the kind of communication that builds friendships from the bottom up all peoples tend to resent the imposition of top down outside forces on their communities but most will be nice to you if you are nice to them that too is human nature to seek out allies and build communities i ve made friends who are not americans have never been to the u s have little interest in the way things are done in the u s many are chilean but some are from other parts of the world our international english speaking church in santiago held an event a few months back that stands out in my mind in which eight people read scripture in eight different languages english spanish portuguese afrikaans russian mandarin chinese korean and filipino in other interactions often at language exchange events i ve met people from hungary poland singapore and the middle east a very articulate kurdish woman fluent in four languages technology used wisely enables us to communicate and share ideas all around the world there s a variety of internationalism that s worth wanting and even treasuring the kind of horizontal internationalism that reaches out and learns about other cultures while respecting them instead of trying to overwhelm them that shares ideas rather than imposing them and might serve as a vehicle for building voluntary problem solving collaborations thus a summing up of what i ve learned and become that makes me different from who i was ten years ago perhaps mirroring where our world could go during the next ten years if we can get on track the world is much more divided and hostile than it was ten years ago there has never been a time when bridge builders were more needed never has their been a greater need to work outside the boxes supplied by the global corporate state and its appendages i d like to think i am more empathetic with people and peoples than i was ten years ago people peoples matter we are all made in the image of the creator even those worshipping a different god s we all have intrinsic value so yes all lives matter we still have quite a ways to go to work out what this means in practice although i would begin by reading biblical new testament works from the gospels to hebrews maybe there are other sacred texts that have something foundational to contribute i don t know i m not an authority on comparative religions but i d check them out before i d rely on economics textbooks and treatises implying that all these peoples should eagerly embrace western materialism and just learn to consume trade is obviously a valid form of interaction but the choice is not to conduct it absent a worldview but rather which worldview s we are going to use to underwrite all our interactions including trade and how we are going to respond when others want to preserve the worldview of their choice instead of being encircled by ours a few remaining loose ends here do we want fewer mass migrations that lead to involuntary and sometimes hostile interactions with native and local populations then let s fight to end the foreign wars that destroy peoples homelands and send them fleeing while lining corporate state pockets let s also end the economic domination that also destroys what gives people s lives meaning impoverishes them until strip mining their resources and removing the profits from their countries breeds revolt do we want fewer enemies then let s recognize peoples the world over as potential friends if approached in the right way as men and women who also value family culture and who find meaning in their connection to principles of a transcendent reality people different from us but alike in being human steven yates s latest book manuscript

of more than 28 in 2019 it was a performance that flirted with the 31 gain of 1997 and one that came very close to topping the 29 6 return of 2013 the tech heavy nasdaq did even better posting a gain of 35 as money flowed to the tech giants cementing apple and microsoft s position as trillion dollar companies the dow jones industrial average was up 22 it was a year filled with fears that were

the fed lowered rates three times falling interest rates sent investors on a quest for yield forcing more money into stocks expected to appreciate pay dividends or both the fed s key rate is now back

donald trump s trade negotiations with china as well as the re crafting of the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico indeed trade war headlines dominated the financial news throughout most of the year trump s tariffs and threats of more tariffs often sent indexes frightfully lower then his pronouncements usually by tweet that deals were coming together would send markets back even higher over the course of the year however the trade war had only transient effects on the stock market as the year came to a close the house passed the united states mexico canada agreement

dollar terms too not exactly shoddy a mirror image of 2018 when almost everything fell perhaps but there have been a couple of important drivers one was china showing it was serious about stimulus for its 14 trillion economy the other was the screeching change of direction by the world s top central banks led by the federal reserve which cut u s interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis more than a decade earlier whereas a year ago the fed was raising rates and earnings were rolling over this year you have felt the fed has been on your side said james clunie who manages asset firm jupiter s absolute return fund they are willing to do qe4 at a stock market record high which is extraordinary he added referring to fed efforts to bring down a spike in money market rates that

across corporate america it arguably should be tagged as the decade of debt with interest rates locked in at rock bottom levels courtesy of the federal reserve s easy money policy after the financial crisis companies found it cheaper than ever to tap the corporate bond market to load up on cash bond issuance by american companies topped 1 trillion in each year of the decade that began on jan 1 2010 and ends on tuesday at midnight an unmatched run according to sifma the securities industry trade group in all corporate bond debt outstanding rocketed more than 50 and will soon top 10 trillion versus about 6 trillion at the end of the previous decade the largest u s companies those in the s p 500 index spx account for roughly 70 of that nearly 7 trillion what did they do with all that money it s a truism in corporate finance that cash needs to be either earning or returning that is being put to use growing the business or getting sent back to shareholders as it happens american companies did a lot more returning than earning with their cash during the tens in the first year of the decade companies spent roughly 60 billion more on dividends and buying back their own shares than on new facilities equipment and technology by last year that gap had mushroomed to more than 600 billion and the gap in 2019 could be just as large especially given the constraint on capital spending from the trade war the buy back boom is credited with helping to fuel a decade long bull market in u s equities meanwhile capital expenditure growth has been choppy at best over 10 years this is despite a massive fiscal stimulus package by the trump administration marked by the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 that it had predicted would boost business spending one byproduct of stock buy backs is they make companies look more profitable by wall street s favorite performance metric earnings per share than they would otherwise appear to be with companies purchasing more and more of their own stock s p 500 eps has roughly doubled in 10 years meanwhile net profit has risen by half that and far more erratically the corporate bond market has not only gotten bigger it has gotten riskier with investors clamoring for yield in a low rate world debt rated only a notch or two above high yield or junk bond levels now accounts for more than half of the investment grade market versus around a third at the dawn of the decade
president donald trump s working class agenda has upset the established order of things inside the republican party remaking the gop into a workers party the president s effort as the washington post reported this weekend hit a fever pitch in 2019 the campaign by the president to remake the gop into a working class party is all encompassing and focuses on virtually every single policy front the washington post s jeff stein wrote president trump shattered republican orthodoxy on an extraordinary range of economic policies in 2019 setting up a more populist record for him to tout during a 2020 campaign in which democrats already are accusing him of abandoning working people from trade to spending from the federal reserve to paid parental leave trump has embraced policy changes that historically are more in line with the approach of democrats establishing a forceful role for government in setting the terms of the economy than of republicans stein continues in the washington post piece by describing just how striking is trump s break with traditional libertarian esque gop orthodoxy that has dominated the republican party since the end of ronald reagan s second term stein wrote on trade trump has reached a phase one trade deal with china that reportedly includes promises to buy far more in u s exports he has completed a revamp of the north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada that some liberals are cheering for labor protections and pharmaceutical policies trump co opted a demand from the left to urge the fed to cut interest rates despite the relatively strong economy a position the central bank ultimately adopted after seeing signs the economic expansion might waver the president has blown away traditional gop concerns over the rising federal deficit cutting bipartisan deals to expand government spending and even extend a new paid leave benefit to the federal workforce he unilaterally implemented a farm bailout that could prove more expensive than the auto bailout was a decade ago a move that conservatives had criticized as wasting taxpayer dollars and while takipeter ng action against former president barack obama s health care law in court the trump administration has avoided moves to immediately blow up the law while pushing to allow states to import cheaper prescription drugs a longtime liberal position opposed by many republicans the piece later quotes trump s trade adviser in the white house peter navarro explaining the shift trump s unique brand of populism is essentially an economic nationalism based on an america first perspective applied to both domestic policies and the international trade arena this revolution has repositioned the republican party into the party of the working class this washington post piece from stein is hardly the only evidence of trump s hard break with a traditional gop economic agenda in favor of a more economic nationalist populist agenda that pulls together some priorities from both republicans and democrats the president s biggest economic win in 2019 the house passage of the u s mexico canada usmca trade agreement came after a year of stalling by house speaker nancy pelosi but with broad bipartisan support and backing from top labor unions like the afl cio and an endorsement from sen sherrod brown d oh who made clear this is the first trade agreement he has ever supported when the usmca eventually passes the u s senate as it is expected to do early in 2020 it will completely remake the trade structure on the north american continent that has been in place since the mid 1990s as a result of the north american free trade agreement nafta trump s shredding of nafta in favor of the much more labor friendly usmca in addition to being a top promise from his 2016 presidential campaign is part of a broader remaking of the economic agenda of republicans in a way that trump s former attorney general and former u s sen jeff sessions has said could be a pathway to generational dominance for the gop should republicans follow through on this path that trump is leading them down sessions who is running again for his old seat in the u s senate and leading polling there in alabama said in a november interview with breitbart news that the gop could dominate for generations if the party embraces the working class agenda that president trump has put forth i m going to push the republican senate conference hard sessions said and i m going to push the house conference the american people want a lawful system of immigration they want to protect the national interest of the united states they re not globalists they want us to protect american manufacturing interests against global trade competition china is the worst offender we have this monumental trade deficit with china so also the world is always wanting the united states to join some organization in which other people get to vote on what should happen around the world and then we re expected to support what they vote for this is why the brits want to brexit and to get out of the e u because the e u has taken over their sovereignty in addition to sessions november interview fox news host tucker carlson the anchor of tucker carlson tonight which airs weeknights in primetime on the fox news channel told breitbart news saturday on siriusxm 125 the patriot channel this weekend that president trump has overseen a shift inside the gop that he says is not even happening fast enough trump showed up in his instinctive way he could smell all of this he couldn t always articulate it but he could feel it carlson said and he shows up and he s basically like the people in charge are doing a completely crappy job and they don t care about you and they re not meeting your basic needs the expressions of that were immigration and trade and a couple of other things but really that s what it was about the people in charge didn t care about the country and the country was rotting i think the realignment is really a response to that it s not just about trump and they think he s obnoxious or whatever okay it s way deeper than that they ve been caught they ve been exposed as fraudulent they haven t done anything for the country like how have you improved america they haven t actually and they ve presided over its decline they should be punished and they are being punished and thank god for that as with any major political realignment the moves by trump have caused some serious waves in the rank and file of the party in fact as of early december a whopping 43 percent nearly half of republicans who were in office in the u s house since trump was inaugurated have left office either by choice or by force red exodus when trump was inaugurated in 2017 there were 241 republicans in the house since then 104 of them 43 have either retired been defeated or are forgoing reelection in 2020 dave wasserman redistrict december 10 2019 but as new blood comes flowing into the party with younger candidates and fresh lawmakers replace the old ones trump is embracing the major shifts inside the party that is now undoubtedly his republican party and in speeches like his address to the turning point usa student action summit in south florida this month trump has hammered home his argument that republicans are the party of working families and democrats are not we believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not for criminal aliens the open borders agenda of the radical left causes profound harm to poor working class americans president trump is putting the safety and well being all all americans first pic twitter com gywezaogwj trump war room text fight to 88022 trumpwarroom december 26 2019 democrats even sense that this is a serious problem for their electoral cause in 2020 with top democrat presidential candidates like vermont sen bernie sanders out publicly claiming that trump has let down the working class last year just five corporations got 16 billion in tax breaks trump is now trying to slash food stamps and throw tens of thousands off of medicaid this is what class warfare looks like we are going to fight back and win that war for the working class bernie sanders berniesanders december 20 2019 other leftists like new york times columnist paul krugman and former labor secretary robert reich keep making that case too hey this is what working class guys in diners wanted wasn t it what was the phrase fill the swamp or something paul krugman paulkrugman december 30 2019 trump campaigned as a champion of the working class but has governed as a lackey for billionaires and corporations democrats must expose him as a fraud offer their own vision to build an economy that works for all it s the only path to victory robert reich rbreich december 27 2019 but the concern from democrats that trump may be cutting deeper into their traditional base than he did in 2016 peeling off more union workers and other working class traditional blue collar democrats has top democrats alarmed according to the washington post s stein stein quotes democrat pollster celinda lake of lake research partners as warning democrats to take this shift trump has overseen inside the gop seriously typically republicans offer things like the deficit and the stock market the upscale economic agenda but trump is trying to include the semblance of a working class economic agenda it isn t real when you look underneath the hood but it sure looks real absent an alternative stein also later quotes pippa norris a political scientist at harvard saying that the populist economic trends that trump is leading here in the united states and the united kingdom s boris johnson is leading across the pond are a global phenomenon that cuts across traditional party or ideological lines populist forces are a global phenomenon norris said they cut across the traditional left right cleavage many populists aren t traditional free market neoliberals or fiscal conservatives in their economic policies leftist filmmaker michael moore who fashions himself a champion of the working class from the political left has predicted this month that president trump would win re election again in 2020 if the election were held now and that it would be an even starker rehash of the 2016 race in that he thinks the democrat would again win the popular vote by higher margins than hillary clinton did last time but that trump would again win the electoral college thanks to working class support the president has won over moore told democracy now s amy goodman i think if the election were held today hillary won by 3 million popular votes i believe whoever the democrat is next year is going to win by 4 to 5 million popular votes there s no question in my mind that people who stayed home who sat on the bench they re going to pour out in california new york and you know but also in texas and whatever i mean places that trump will probably win but yeah there s going to be a much higher percentage of people voting against him the problem is is that he will if the vote were today i believe he would win the electoral states that he would need because living out there i will tell you his level of support has not gone down one inch in fact i d say it s even more rabid than it was before because they re afraid now they re afraid he could lose because they watched his behavior so they are voracious in their appetite for donald trump that s the bad news a bigger question than how these remarkable policy changes for republicans will affect the presidential race america has already seen that one time in 2016 a trend that even leftists like moore seem to admit will repeat itself if not intensify is how this may affect down ticket races in other words it remains to be seen if president trump can carry coattails for other republicans in house senate and gubernatorial races in some places in 2019 like governor s races in kentucky and louisiana republicans lost to democrats in louisiana incumbent democrat gov john bel edwards won re election while in kentucky incumbent gop gov matt bevin lost to now democrat gov andy beshear but in mississippi trump helped republican tate reeves across the finish line holding off democrat jim hood back in the 2018 midterm elections democrats won a number of house seats retaking the majority from republicans for the first time in eight years but on the u s senate side of things republicans won a number of seats from democrats taking away from them in key places like missouri indiana and florida for republicans to retake the house majority in 2020 they would need to win back a net 18 seats from democrats there are currently 30 districts that democrats represent but trump won in 2016 and another dozen to 20 or so other seats considered battlegrounds so the question is whether the gop can field strong enough candidates in enough places to flip the majority alongside the president at the top of the ticket democrats going into the 2020 congressional elections will likely attempt to claim they have been responsible for helping the president move toward this nationalist economic agenda but republicans will correctly point out in response that the vast majority of the democrats in the house spent all of 2019 impeaching president trump while the president was making all of these significant economic shifts for the country and while the democrats in the house were so laser focused on impeachment the president s economic vision this nationalist populist remaking of the gop agenda has led to a national jobs boom where unemployment has reached a 50 year low at 3 5 percent and wages are on the rise especially among working class americans the president since day one has been working hard to make sure that american families the american people are at the center of this administration and what we are trying to achieve and we ve seen that in the economy we ve seen that in our new trade agreement the usmca with south korea and with many others this is a president who has put the economy and the american people first and foremost in every single one of our policy initiatives white house spokesman adam kennedy said in a pre christmas appearance on breitbart news sunday on siriusxm 125 the patriot channel one of the things this economy has really been spectacular at is making sure that people who used to be left behind in previous economies people without college degrees people who come from more martial backgrounds have seen some of the biggest gains kennedy added the jobs numbers keep on rolling too as president trump has created more than seven million jobs since taking office according to assistant secretary of public affairs at the u s treasury department monica crowley who joined breitbart news saturday in early december to discuss the previous month s jobs numbers crowley during that interview noted the increase in wages too and called trump s economic successes as president a blue collar boom since the president s election in november 2016 the economy has added more than seven million jobs crowley said this is more than the entire population of massachusetts last year it s also 5 1 million more jobs than the congressional budget office cbo projected in its final forecast before the 2016 election what it shows is common sense economic policies based on freedom work tax cuts deregulation unleashing the energy sector and trying to realign international trade all of which this president promised during the campaign all of which he has delivered that in turn is delivering us this incredible economy

25pc 31 december 2019 03 55 pm london reuters for all the angst about trade wars geopolitics and a sputtering and overly indebted global economy 2019 might just be the best year investors have ever

gold has sparkled wall street spx and msci s near 50 country world index miwd00000pus have both stormed to record highs after 30 and 24 leaps europe japan china and brazil are all up at least 20 in dollar terms too not exactly shoddy a mirror image of 2018 when almost everything fell perhaps but there have been a couple of important drivers one was china showing it was serious about stimulus for its 14 trillion economy the other was the screeching change of direction by the world s top central banks led by the federal reserve which cut u s interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis more than a decade earlier whereas a year ago the fed was raising rates and earnings were rolling over this year you have felt the fed has been on your side said james clunie who manages asset firm jupiter s absolute return fund they are willing to do qe4 at a stock market record high which is extraordinary he added referring to fed efforts to bring down a spike in money market rates that

11 and egypt s pound egp is sandwiched in between with a 11 7 gain the decade of debt big deals bigger risk whatever nickname ultimately gets attached to the now ending twenty tens on wall street and across corporate america it arguably should be tagged as the decade of debt with interest rates locked in at rock bottom levels courtesy of the federal reserve s easy money policy after the financial crisis companies found it cheaper than ever to tap the corporate bond market to load up on cash bond issuance by american companies topped 1 trillion in each year of the decade that began on jan 1 2010 and ends on tuesday at midnight an unmatched run according to sifma the securities industry trade group in all corporate bond debt outstanding rocketed more than 50 and will soon top 10 trillion versus about 6 trillion at the end of the previous decade the largest u s companies those in the s p 500 index spx account for roughly 70 of that nearly 7 trillion what did they do with all that money it s a truism in corporate finance that cash needs to be either earning or returning that is being put to use growing the business or getting sent back to shareholders as it happens american companies did a lot more returning than earning with their cash during the tens in the first year of the decade companies spent roughly 60 billion more on dividends and buying back their own shares than on new facilities equipment and technology by last year that gap had mushroomed to more than 600 billion and the gap in 2019 could be just as large especially given the constraint on capital spending from the trade war the buy back boom is credited with helping to fuel a decade long bull market in u s equities meanwhile capital expenditure growth has been choppy at best over 10 years this is despite a massive fiscal stimulus package by the trump administration marked by the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 that it had predicted would boost business spending one byproduct of stock buy backs is they make companies look more profitable by wall street s favorite performance metric earnings per share than they would otherwise appear to be with companies purchasing more and more of their own stock s p 500 eps has roughly doubled in 10 years meanwhile net profit has risen by half that and far more erratically the corporate bond market has not only gotten bigger it has gotten riskier with investors clamoring for yield in a low rate world debt rated only a notch or two above high yield or junk bond levels now accounts for more than half of the investment grade market versus around a third at the dawn of the decade
work by daniel leber at 2019 buenos aires 2019 arrived like a new year in the final days of 2018 santiago villanueva an artist and art historian from azul argentina announced on his instagram that he would open an exhibition space with fellow artists rosario zorraquín and fernanda laguna in buenos aires s villa crespo neighborhood the post looked like an informal invitation to a new year s eve party ya viene 2019 spacio de arte 2019 spacio de arte is coming outlined in bubble letters over an airbrushed blue and violet orb of lo res glitter for 2019 the three artists who are also curators writers poets and organizers would collectively curate approximately one exhibition per month just for the year each lasted only as long as its opening the artists whose works were shown were decidedly outside of the art system consider ana wandzik with her whimsically embroidered creatures and poignantly brief diaristic poems or anahi sosa whose meticulous practice involves sculpting wood into sensuously supple forms but also braiding hair or gabriela binder aka chicatrans whose macabre comic book drawings chronicle the misadventures of trans women gladys afamado a ninety four year old uruguayan engraver who now makes photoshop collages and word puzzles on facebook and clara angélica castro who has created a new reality for her plush life size human dolls she calls los muchachos events of all kinds performances readings conversations fashion shows and dj sets coincided with most of these shows works by the aforementioned artists and others were installed in a poorly lit corridor per the founders description and the adjoining courtyard of a simple two story residence with zorraquín s studio and a terrace on the upper level unassuming from the outside graffitied facades middling architecture the building reveals itself to be magical when the tiny one car garage door is opened colorful light illuminating laguna s el universo the universe beams out and welcomes people into the cheap and cheerful gift shop brimming with stuffed animals sand branches drawings stickers bibelots and ephemera this wonder for all of the universe s creations and those who make them enlivened 2019 evident in the artworks exhibited but also in the gallery s nonhierarchical structure and anti professional ethos at some point during the year the spacio de arte became a spazio de arte a joke about the founders italian ancestry as much as about the cliché that argentinians are eurocentric that was said to give their hallway some european luxury in the playfully ironic words of villanueva artists and founders cooperatively installed and deinstalled the shows and cleaned up together at the end of the night works were priced around two thousand pesos a little over thirty us dollars making it possible for noncollectors to support artists labor when things sold and many did 2019 s founders didn t take a cut no official installation photos were taken there were no web pages checklists mailing lists private views or press releases fran stella instead lo fi flyers were made for each show and circulated in whatsapp chats and on instagram on any given night those who came through might have been the artists family friends friends of friends and neighbors from the surrounding area which while home to a number of contemporary art galleries hasn t quite undergone total gentrification like the adjacent palermo district people spilled out onto the sidewalk in front of the open door to el universo for hours into the night talking smoking sipping fernet or cerveza leaving only to buy more drinks or empanadas to share we danced and listened to music by artists like gilda the late argentine cumbia singer of near saintly status and kim petras the trans pop phenom who dropped two new albums this year photocopied libritos little books were made for each show and sold for ten pesos not even twenty cents words and images by the artists were included therein alongside the same question to be answered differently by the founders por qué hacíamos exposiciones en los dos mil diecinueve why were we making exhibitions in 2019 december in argentina is distinctive it s the liveliest month of summer before las fiestas and las vacaciones it s also when new presidents are sworn in in 2015 this was mauricio macri the first democratically elected non radical non peronist president in nearly a century his eponymous breed of neoliberalism and right wing populist policies macrismo gained momentum during his various tenures in the city government 2005 15 coinciding with the left wing populism of the kirchner presidencies néstor carlos kirchner jr 2003 2007 cristina fernández de kirchner 2007 15 which followed the country s most recent and severest great depression 1998 2002 this was the moment of the argentinazo when in december 2001 argentinians took to the streets with pots and pans a form of popular demonstration called cacerolazo to protest restricted banking policies known as el corralito the pegging of the argentine peso to the us dollar and spiraling debt police brutality ensued five presidents assumed office in eleven days adolfo rodríguez saá in office for a week announced argentina s ninety three billion dollar sovereign debt on december 23 it was on this same date seventeen years later that villanueva announced the beginning of 2019 the new year would bring total economic collapse work by gabriela binder chicatrans this year s december was triumphal thousands rallied in the plaza de mayo on december 10 as alberto fernández of frente de todos front of all a coalition that aimed to bring together all factions of peronism returned to the casa rosada this time as the president he had previously served as the chief of the cabinet of ministers during the kirchner years with cristina fernández de kirchner as his vp macri s fifty six billion dollar imf bailout in september 2018 the largest in the organization s history and argentina s third sovereign default since 2001 resulted in cuts to pensions and public utilities and proved that his economic agenda would not bring about the stability he promised when it was clear that his cambiemos let s change coalition had effected no positive change at all fernández could oust him 2019 was a response to macrismo its plutocracy disregard for social welfare and privileging of international capital over national and regional interests it drew on the example of earlier alternative spaces like the centro cultural ricardo rojas and belleza y felicidad beauty and happiness founded in 1989 and 1999 respectively the two galleries bookended the decade long presidency of carlos saúl menem during which he leveraged his form of peronism to implement drastic neoliberal reforms austerity privatization and a proliferation of international commodities marked this period as well as a whatever it takes entrepreneurial ethos that menem himself embodied so much so that the term menemismo which first referred to a political alignment with the president later expanded to describe virtually anyone who flaunted their wealth through conspicuous consumption the artists associated with the centro cultural ricardo rojas graciela hasper magdalena jitrik benito laren alfredo londaibere cristina schiavi omar schiliro marcelo pombo and laguna herself among many others refused this neoliberal turn founded by artist curator jorge gumier maier who also exhibited his work there in what he called a poorly lit corridor his words were invoked by 2019 s founders decades later at the universidad de buenos aires in 1989 the gallery radically reoriented argentine contemporary art rejecting normative artistic and political ideologies through the artists investment in vernacular materials and light seemingly anti intellectual and apolitical aesthetics the decorative the beautiful and kitsch clara angélica castro and her los muchachos after gumier maier stepped down as director in 1996 and as many of the el rojas artists were subsumed into the art world proper there was a cultural vacuum to be filled three years later laguna and poets cecilia pavón and gabriela bejerman started belleza y felicidad it was created in the spirit of a regaleria gift shop where artworks were as sweet fun and notwithstanding inflation affordable as the curios on offer alongside them not unlike those for sale in el universo these objects gestured toward a certain argentinismo a x offering a mode of communal luxury in symbolic opposition to global commodities belleza y felicidad ran an imprint of the same name and was a gathering space for parties workshops and readings stories and poetry often autobiographical with queer protagonists and influenced by emails blogs texts and social media filled the pages of black and white photocopied booklets as scholar cecilia palmeiro has observed in her research on their literature and activities the gallery s publications and events furthered countercultural oral traditions imagining different ways of togetherness amid the profound economic political and technological changes sweeping the aughts belleza y felicidad sought to retain some of the internet s initial idealism toward democratized self expression and communication but in physical space and on a relatively local scale while its first location in buenos aires s almagro neighborhood closed in 2007 the gallery s imprint continues to publish and participate in book fairs laguna also opened a second belleza y felicidad in 2003 in villa fioriot a very low income city south of the capital where she still organizes workshops and free gourmet dinners as with belleza y felicidad and the centro cultural ricardo rojas before it 2019 militated against its cultural and technological milieu against the homogenizing effects of feed aggregators and influencer culture against the influx of global art world interests and their professionalizing standards is it any wonder that art basel s cities initiative found its footing in the context of macrismo why were any of us making exhibitions in 2019 in one answer to this question laguna zorraquín and villanueva write to tolerate together the misfortunes and sadness that macri caused us with artists and works we thought of ways to resist together ways to embrace each other to be calm but awake the works and artists always reminded us that politics and art should be closer and achieving this closeness they believed could be done through very simple means by bringing people out of their homes to convene around art like a family bonfire work by ana wandzik the closing exhibition of 2019 was on december 6 days before fernández and fernández de kirchner were sworn in castro was invited back to organize this last show her hand stitched garments for los muchachos were available for others to wear princess dresses vests capes hand painted t shirts chokers so were her masks made of buckets and tubes and those of otherworldly creatures made by florencia rodríguez giles the evening was accompanied by castro s music and choreography though anybody could join in adorned and enrobed everyone danced in a celebratory almost mystical trance like any of us laguna villanueva and zorraquín could not anticipate the outcome of 2019 when it began the years leading up to it had been difficult giving rise to a suspicion among many argentinians that their destiny was cursed so the three friends imagined putting a blessing on the year to leave one thing to enter another thing that is supposed to be better without knowing for certain that macri wouldn t be reelected they wanted to better the neighborhood and the city too their language derisively echoed that of the former president s empty cambiemos campaigns but 2019 s words were also heartfelt and intentional the final exhibition invitation was a slight variation of the first with a rough superimposition of los muchachos over the same glittering background as though asking the question why 2019 of himself villanueva s caption read it was beautiful to do it kerry doran is writer and curator with projects based out of buenos aires hong kong and new york

this part 1 of our two part series three contributors weigh in on where they think equities will be heading next year tomorrow new year s day we ll publish contributor analysis focused on commodities forex and the general market outlook read it declan fallon new breakout following cyclical bear recovery most of 2019 was spent making back the losses from the latter part of 2018 with the s p and waiting until october to finally provide the rally that delivered new all time highs for this year the still has some ground to make up with the 2018 high around 1 740 remaining some distance away so while some may talk of big gains delivered from the start of the year for indices what we are really looking at is a new breakout following a cyclical bear recovery when framed like this the true winner for 2020 could be growth stocks the russell 2000 via ishares russell 2000 etf nyse is primed to challenge the 2018 high with a mini breakout from this year s consolidation this is a very healthy looking chart adding fuel to the rally is an election year that trump will be keen to pump the has done well for 2019 like the rail companies of old it is a bellwether for the economy so if it is booming businesses are expanding and updating their technology requirements while the pace of this rally may slow for 2020 the tone has been set for the year traders may have to wait until the summer before they see some joy to the upside the 200 day ma was the bounce point from early in the year and 4 500s was a resistance level in 2017 so it may turn into support for 2020 bitcoin is to millenials as gold is to boomers it will have its day again michele schneider watch growth signals from russell retail transports considering the december rally in the indices and particularly the s p 500 and the two possible scenarios emerge for 2020 either the market is forward thinking and assumes the economy will begin to expand in 2020 or by keeping interest rates near zero or in some cases negative the federal reserve and global central banks have incentivized corporations to continue their record share buybacks for the upcoming year to date corporations have done little to expand development or hiring instead they have mainly raised dividends to reward shareholders as well as invested in their own stocks that will have to change to keep up with the to tell if the u s economy is indeed expanding investors should watch the domestically focused along with two key sectors the russell 2000 iwm is the best representative of the u s economy it s composed of small cap companies that manufacture or produce goods in the u s to date iwm has begun to move out of a base but it s still well off the all time highs made in 2018 we can consider iwm as the supply side of economics nyse has also lagged the spx via the spdr s p 500 etf nyse the nasdaq via invesco qqq trust nasdaq and the via spdr dow jones industrial average etf trust nyse with the recent dismal performance of fedex nyse transportation or the demand side of economics has a major job to do to prove goods are robustly moving throughout the country iyt must hold over 188 00 and eventually clear 200 00 bricks and mortar retail nyse has been the biggest laggard with weak this sector has been the ugly duckling reflecting high consumer debt likely to increase further during the holiday season therefore xrt must hold above 44 00 and clear 47 00 or the 2019 highs regardless of what the key index and sectors do geopolitically 2020 is likely to become more volatile that makes stagflation another real possibility in 2019 the ratio between stocks and commodities hit a 100 year low as we end 2019 the ratio has contracted some but can shrink much more in 2020 since 1979 has remained muted given statements by steven kaplan the president of the dallas reserve that interest rates will remain low and the future of the as the world s reserve currency is questionable the best trades for 2020 could be in commodities there will be more on this tomorrow to summarize investors need to watch the small caps transportation and bricks and mortar retail sectors for signs of economic growth or stagnation with low interest rates an uncertain future for the dollar and rising geopolitical volatility inflation should increase with the possibility of an emerging stagflation environment jani ziedins no 2019 repeat but 2020 could be great for opportunistic swing traders 2019 was the year of a generous and gentle rally the s p 500 climbed nearly 30 and most pullbacks were benign with prices recovering quickly this strength was definitely aided by a snapback from 2018 s grossly oversold 4th quarter regardless of the source this looks to be the market s second strongest annual performance since the dot com bubble while crashes are scary and forever seared into the memory of anyone who lives through one they are exceedingly rare most active traders will only see one or two in their careers will next year be one of those years probably not especially since the market is not grossly overbought or overleveraged like it was during the dot com and housing bubbles stocks are definitely not cheap but they are not bubblelicious either unfortunately for us 2020 will look nothing like 2019 as the market almost never repeats a performance and next year won t be any different if we a cross the prospect of a strong rally off the list of possibilities we re left with three potential scenarios modest rally slight dip or stock market crash crossing both extremes off the list leaves us with a little up or a little down at this point i could see either happening the labor market is stretched and will keep a lid on economic growth going forward if a business cannot find new staff it cannot expand no matter how strong demand is on the other side modest stock market gains could easily be wiped out if an unpopular republican president is replaced by a democrat fear of looming regulations and taxes will send stocks retreating in the final months of 2020 and so that is my prediction fairly modest gains between 5 and 10 if trump wins if he loses expect a flat year but where we end is only one piece of the puzzle how we get there is even more important to active traders everyone knows stocks cannot sit still and like a sugared up 5 year old they always have to be moving sometimes

this article is more than 4 years old joaquin temes everyone knew the international monetary fund s projections about the speed of argentina s recovery after agreeing to bail out the beleaguered nation with a record us 56 billion loan were unrealistic they were as much of a fiction as the projections underlying the 2018 budget passed by the mauricio macri administration in late 2017 which hours after passing the legislation through both chambers of congress decided to tell the central bank then led by federico sturzenegger to abandon inflation targeting effectively raising expectations about what it had just committed itself to before the legislature while no one could ve predicted the magnitude of the argentine economic meltdown it was clear that a quick recovery was highly improbable still the structural program that accompanied the imf s loan supposedly put together by technical teams responding to both the fund and argentina s then economy minister nicolás dujovne prescribed tough austerity on both the fiscal and monetary fronts one could argue there was no alternative as in macri s first two years in office the fiscal expansion worsened the deficit while monetary contraction sought to tackle inflation ineffectively once international debt financing dried up the market took care of the correction macri was unable to execute it is clear now that the imf and macri s economic team are directly responsible for what has happened since the current state of argentina s economy is perilous the typical metaphor is that of a ticking time bomb the same one that was used when macri took over the reins from cristina fernández de kirchner in charge of the economy ministry now is martín guzmán an anti austerity economist who cut his teeth under nobel laureate joseph stiglitz at the prestigious columbia university in new york quoted by the financial times stiglitz praises guzmán thusly the thing about martín is that he is terrific at mathematical models and high theory but he s also interested in changing things in the real world while stigtlitz is taking a stab at his orthodox colleagues what he s indicating is that guzmán is a skilled economist from a theoretical standpoint his argentine mentor economist daniel heymann of the universidad nacional de la plata told noticias magazine guzmán is valuable and pragmatic in december guzmán was named chair of the currency credit and banks department of that university replacing heymann while guzmán s economic plan isn t entirely clear yet initial signs of moderation have pleased the market in his first major public address as economy minister a few weeks ago guzmán spoke of macroeconomic consistency while making it clear that the policy framework his team plans to put in place has the intention of stabilizing the economy probably his most important message was that there is no margin for excessive fiscal stimulus and that the use of the printing press to jumpstart the economy would be destabilizing while this appears to be a message aimed at foreign creditors in the context of the coming debt restructuring which will be the key to his success or failure in the hot seat that is the economy ministry it is a welcome statement given pressure from different segments to rely on monetary expansion in the current context where argentina is effectively locked out of international markets over indebted and still in situation of fiscal deficit the contours of the plan are beginning to come into view guzmán along with matías kulfas at the production ministry miguel ángel pesce at the central bank and the rest of the related official entities will look to provide relief to the lower sectors of society at the expense of the agricultural sector and overall higher taxes on personal wealth currency controls will be tightened with taxes aimed at disincentivizing dollar denominated consumption and savings while export taxes will be raised along with alberto fernández s social solidarity and productive activation law the idea is to freeze public service costs for 180 days while ordaining increases in pension payments and private sector salaries by decree there s more to the plan but the basic idea is that through a social pact that includes the major economic and political actors price increases will be contained while real wages should rise above inflation therefore aiming at producing a consumption shock that should drag the economy out of recession this will be financed to a small degree by monetary expansion by higher taxes on specific sectors which by definition reduces output and should all happen in the context of a move toward fiscal balance and a trade surplus due to a competitive peso dollar exchange rate there is a clear break with the imf s orthodoxy and macri s obsession with fiscal surplus a keynesian wink of sorts it isn t entirely clear how argentina will improve its productivity therefore generating the conditions for a competitive export sector that produces enough dollars to break the eternal vicious cycle that has destroyed the national currency yet it is the first time in a while that there is a plan on the table and the feeling of security and predictability of actually having a plan something guzmán indicated he will put down on paper has sent positive signs to the market guzmán became a known name in argentina a few months before fernández s electoral victory mainly as a sovereign debt restructuring specialist restoring debt sustainability is a necessary condition for economic recovery economic recovery is a necessary condition for restoring debt sustainability he explained in a recent presentation in which he argued for a two year moratorium on debt payments the rejection of any additional imf money and a successful negotiation with creditors that avoids a default and should be concluded by march 2020 he also wants a convergence to primary fiscal surpluses and trade balance consistent with sustainable reprofiled debt at a speed that does not create destabilising macroeconomic effects austerity as a general remedy to a public debt crises does not work half of the countries that went through a sovereign debt restructuring with private creditors were forced to default or restructure again within three years guzmán argued noting that only ireland in 1987 successfully came out of a default through austerity why its main trading partner was experiencing an economic boom at the time without the stroke of good luck nations are set on a path to more distress and the constant risk of default the memory of greece is all too fresh a nation which lost 25 percent of its gdp from 2007 to 2013 in the context of a series of imf bailouts and structural austerity programmes it is unclear if the social pact that fernández and his team are looking to introduce will succeed in rooting inflationary momentum and activating the economy yet the rejection of austerity as the only way out of argentina s crisis which appears to be guzmán s main contribution seems like the right way out of this mess and the idea of macreconomic coherence in particular given the fiscal deficit and the size of the debt pile gives the rejection of austerity a logical framework now it s time to see if the economist can put his theoretical toolbox to work on the real economy

the success of the euro highly depends on better german economic conditions next week on friday there will be the release of the german consumer price index for the month of december according to the forecast there will be a substantial uptick in the price pressures which will support the euro against its rival currencies however analysts stated that the improvement in the inflation rate would not be enough to increase the interest rates by the european central bank but this will help the euro exchange rate to rise on the other hand if the actual value will come in short of expectations then it will reverse the direction of the euro furthermore at 1 00 gmt the spanish flash consumer price index for the year was dropped to 0 8 from the expectations of 0 9 and weighed on single currency euro

the united states and china led investors to higher risk assets while a year end rally that lifted global equity markets to record highs stayed alive on the last trading day of 2019 a gauge of world

forward however kelly said it will be hard to achieve similar gains with us equities likely to advance by mid single digits annually for several years international markets especially emerging markets

the pound and trade sensitive currencies rallied on improving us china trade relations and the outlook for global growth the decline of the dollar is one of the biggest bets in the fx market for 2020 we could be right at a turning point where global growth re accelerates relative to us growth and that could mean a weaker dollar over time kelly said the dollar was strong for much of 2019 thanks to the relative outperformance of the us economy and investors preference for a safe haven currency amid the trade dispute but the dollar s gains for the year shrivelled in december investors bought up

file in this dec 13 2019 file photo trader ashley lara works on the floor of the new york stock exchange ap photo richard drew file read more between 2010 and 2020 stocks and bonds have been on an amazing run but annual returns won t be as high over the next decade so cool your expectations professional investors warned the 2010 2020 period may be the only decade without a recession in u s history and the highest s p earnings growth in u s history said matt topley with fortis wealth in king of prussia while the decade was the longest economic expansion ever recorded it has also been the weakest of the post wwii era according to wells fargo s annual economic outlook advertisement the decade also didn t beat out the best for stock returns we are still well behind the 1987 2000 bull run topley noted as a result the stock market is expensive but nothing like the 1999 2000 bubble and the overvaluations in today s markets are private equity and private lending topley said good news a u s economic recession isn t on the horizon for 2020 in fact this current expansion could continue for many more years according to one prominent market forecaster we are less vulnerable to shocks in 2020 because there are few imbalances in the economy wrote torsten slok chief economist with deutsche bank in a recent note to bank clients because of the experience in 2008 2009 households and companies have been hesitant to spend too much money and take too much risk as a result 10 years into this expansion discretionary spending is still below its historical average he added highly unusual compared with previous cycles the lack of willingness to spend on consumer durables and capital expenditures is also a reason that this expansion has been so weak he added and also the reason why this expansion could continue for many more years topley of fortis wealth made some predictions for 2020 and beyond the biggest mistake investors make is thinking the next decade will look like the previous 10 years large cap growth stocks crushed all other asset classes in 2010s leaving them at record spreads in valuations versus value stocks and international stocks the next 10 years will reward a diversified portfolio retirees are in a predicament stocks are trading at high levels and interest rates are low so savings accounts aren t producing income meanwhile americans are living longer without pensions and many will need some form of long term care after a tremendous run wall street has tempered expectations for stock and bond market returns for the next decade vanguard tempers forecasts vanguard the malvern based mutual fund giant with nearly 6 trillion in assets has slightly lowered its projected returns we have to get mentally and financially prepared for lower returns in the next 10 years topley said vanguard last may issued 10 year forecasts for u s equity returns of 4 to 6 annually and u s aggregate bond returns 2 5 to 4 5 a year this month vanguard issued slightly lower forecasts for stocks to 3 5 to 5 5 annually and for bonds to 2 to 4 a year over the next decade the full forecast is available on vanguard s website in addition 2018 was a year in which stocks bonds and commodities all fell in price prompting record high volatility while 2019 was the opposite with all asset classes showing high returns and volatility at record lows this coming year 2020 will see that volatility return topley believes the s p averages a 14 pullback per year with 5 to 10 pullbacks being commonplace we will see those return in 2020 he said bull markets end when everyone is all in and the last stage euphoria sets in he added but we have not seen that yet in u s markets the college economy americans started the decade in 2010 with unemployment at near 10 now it s in the 3 range the s p 500 has nearly tripled home prices have appreciated by 34 but whether americans prospered during the longest economic expansion in modern history depended a good deal on their level of education a new survey by credible found that compared with high school graduates americans with a bachelor s degree or higher were almost three times as likely to own stocks or bonds 88 more likely to have purchased a home 71 more likely to have saved for retirement 58 more likely to have maintained health coverage that may explain why the recovery after the great recession handed out winnings unevenly and why the popularity of big government spending continues a significant chunk of u s economic outperformance over the past five years has been about fiscal stimulus said lyn alden a financial adviser and analyst based in absecon n j for the first time in modern history the u s deficit is widening to a large deficit during a nonwartime nonrecessionary period the debt as a percentage of gdp grew from 62 to 106 over the past decade although large u s deficits aren t unusual inflation often follows more concerning says ali wolf director of economic research at meyers research is the potential for less investment in the economy and high levels of government debt could hurt growth either through increased risk of a fiscal crisis or hindering our ability to respond to future downturns today s high levels of debt are pulling away from meaningful investments in the country even with low interest rates roughly 8 of the budget goes toward servicing interest payments and that percentage will rise as our debt increases the government will struggle to refinance repurchase and pay off the debt if interest rates were to rise again inflation retirees and other investors feel they re paying more for everyday items especially health care and tuition even though the federal reserve claims inflation is hovering around 2 annually jim bianco of bianco research wrote on nov 29 the fed instituted its inflation target in january 2012 targeting a year over year at 2 the fed can contort themselves all they want but they have not been successful in hitting this target looking forward inflation expectations suggest the fed will struggle to hit their 2 goal bond investor david kotok of cumberland advisors said measures of inflation he tracks mostly confirm that view although there are indications that a little more inflation could be forthcoming in 2020 we think some more inflation could show up in 2020 if we didn t have the trump trade war dynamics interfering with economic cycles instead we have sluggish capital expenditures as business agents defer decisions because of high and rising trump uncertainties kotok said invest away from politics ubs forecasts that the u s central bank s federal funds interest rate will be lowered to 0 9 in 2020 and that means it s a great time to refinance a mortgage said julie fox market head for northeast private wealth management at ubs clients are also asking how is the u s election impacting investors what we say is you can brace for volatility in certain sectors and pick investments less dependent on political outcomes fox said including emerging markets particularly u s dollar denominated sovereign debt gene therapy companies and equities in markets such as japan china and brazil in addition she said the drivers are intact for a continued rally in the price of gold

among those four significant concerns are highlighted here with suggestions to move forward first the poor revenue mobilisation effort has been the lowest in the region the deceleration of revenue gdp ratio started in fyi 2012 which continues till today though the average tax gdp ratio in the least developed countries ldcs is about 15 percent in 2017 in bangladesh tax gdp ratio was a mere 9 2 percent in fy 2018 2019 revenue gdp ratio was also low at 9 9 percent this trend in no way can assure us that the targets of the seventh five year plan 7fyp to achieve 16 1 percent revenue gdp ratio and 14 1 percent tax gdp ratio will be achieved by fy 2019 2020 unless a miracle happens on the other hand the revenue mobilisation effort is gradually becoming more dependent on indirect taxes though during fy 2009 2015 the share of income tax in total revenue collection was rising it started to decline since then so the tax system is becoming rather inequitable and discriminating towards the lower income groups an important implication for revenue shortfall is that it limits the government s ability to effectively allocate more resources for public services and social sectors such as health education and social protection second the banking sector is now stuck in a quagmire of woes all parameters of the banking sector indicate its persistent fragility with no sign of revival on the horizon the most discussed issue in the banking sector is the sky rocketing non performing loans npls in june 2019 the total volume of npl increased to bdt 112 430 which was 11 69 percent of total outstanding loans surprisingly state owned commercial banks had npls of over 30 percent of their total loans but npl is also a problem of private commercial banks while the share of npl in state owned commercial banks has been 49 percent in the fourth quarter of fy 2018 2019 the share was 46 percent in the private commercial banks along with high npl rescheduling and writing off loans are also on the rise this may clear the balance sheet but ultimately it is still a huge burden for banks despite high economic growth domestic credit growth has remained stagnant since the last fiscal year in fact domestic credit growth of 13 46 percent is below the target of 14 5 percent set out in the monetary policy statement of fy 2019 2020 of bangladesh bank more worrying is the significant decline in private sector credit growth compared to 14 94 percent in august 2018 this has declined to 10 68 percent in august 2019 as opposed to this government borrowing from banks has been on the rise due to a slowdown in the sales of national savings certificate and most importantly due to low revenue generation by national board of revenue the government has to resort to huge bank borrowing to finance the mega projects but delays in such large scale projects and weak accountability have escalated the cost by multiple times such borrowing may have serious implications on the government s fiscal management as it is the private sector has an inertia to make new investment private investment has been stagnant around 23 percent of gdp for the last couple of years now that the government has already borrowed 99 5 percent of its bank borrowing target by december 2019 how the private sector will access bank loans in case the government exceeds its targets will be an issue to be worried about also with low revenue mobilisation effort government s ability to repay bank loans is limited despite low credit growth liquidity stress in bank has mounted as deposit grew at a slow rate this is again due to nearly zero interest rate on deposits when interest rate is adjusted with inflation rate and a cap on deposit rate has been fixed at 6 percent third the external sector has been exhibiting disquieting trends the balance of payment bop situation was negative in fy 2018 for the first time since fy 2011 both current account balance and overall balance during july october 2019 have been negative against the growth target of export by 12 2 percent in fy 2019 2020 during july november 2019 export sector saw a negative growth of 7 6 percent growth of readymade garments rmg during this period was negative at 7 7 percent and that of non rmg was negative at 6 9 percent there has been declining share of rmg products in the us market in the non traditional markets that is beyond the usa and the european union export has been very low both product and market diversifications have been emphasised time and time again the issue of depreciation of bangladeshi taka against us dollar has been strongly advocated in view of other competing countries currency depreciation however as an import dependent country policy makers also have to do forex management prudently as we also have to import more important issue here is increasing productivity through efficiency incentives to the rmg sector cannot be a never ending practice especially when the sector has improved and matured so much other export sectors should also be given opportunity if we want export diversification imports have also seen a decline in 2019 this has led to a wider trade gap imports of capital machinery industrial raw material and fuel oil have declined one of the implications of reduced imports of capital machinery by 18 4 percent during july october 2019 is less investment made by the private sector fourth the high growth has not been inclusive and job creating consumption and wealth inequality are high and job opportunities are limited for youth and women while growth without investment could not generate employment for the educated youth the employers also do not find those youth suitable for available jobs the mismatch between the supply and demand of the young labour force should be minimised by a thorough review of the curriculum and providing more focus on needs of the job market of course amid many negative signs of the economy growth of remittance by bangladeshis working abroad has been a happy one without high remittances bop deficit would have been higher a worrying sign however is the reduction in the number of workers going abroad while the government needs to explore new markets proactively skills upgradation of workers is a must in sum despite high growth and better remittances bangladesh economy in 2019 has passed through a number of stresses the fiscal space has shrunk with limited efforts of domestic resource mobilisation and excessive bank borrowing financial discipline has been broken through cost escalation of mega projects and ailing banking system the outlook for the economy in 2020 will depend on whether and how structural and institutional reforms will be undertaken by the government can the government do away with the inefficient system and continue to take stern measures against corruption these will be important political decisions as the country steps into a larger landscape of a developing country and an upper middle income country these issues will continue to haunt the economy every day if these fundamental issues remain unaddressed for long the economy will lose its sheen today or tomorrow because high growth means nothing if it does not change the lives of each and every member of the society dr fahmida khatun is the executive director at the centre for policy dialogue
vanguard canada canada a bright spot among developed economies for 2020 vanguard forecasts continued slowdown in global growth except for canada vanguard sees canada as a bright spot among developed economies with a growth forecast at 1 6 the eurozone and u s growth forecast are both at 1 0 while china is at 5 8 investors should prepare for a lower return environment over the next decade with periods of market volatility in the near term we expect uncertainty stemming from geopolitics policymaking and trade tensions to undermine global growth over the coming year said todd schlanger senior investment strategist at vanguard canada for canada the picture is slightly rosier with a resilient labour market and robust wage growth leading to growth levels stronger than most developed economies in 2020 with a slight improvement over 2019 over a ten year period canadian equity market returns are forecast to be in the 3 5 5 5 annualized range with canadian fixed income likely to be 1 5 2 5 annualized over the same period these returns are lower than the prior ten year period predicting a more challenging market period ahead for investors as we enter into this new age of uncertainty canadian investors should prepare for volatility that could result from a lack of clarity on trade and slowing economic growth in the u s that may negatively impact canadian exports and weaken commodity prices despite this we see stability in the domestic housing market and favourable conditions relative to other developed markets with a better capacity to absorb an unexpected economic shock investors can t control the markets but they can control their investment strategy by maintaining a diversified portfolio keeping investment costs low and focusing on the long term while tuning out the daily noise investors can improve their chances of investment success schlanger said bank of montreal brian belski chief investment strategist canada as a value play yes for the past several years our overriding theme for canadian equities has been as america goes so goes canada granted while we believe the u s will continue its secular trend of outperforming canada in 2020 our overall theme for canada relative to u s positioning remains very much intact canada as a value play we think the answer is a resounding yes especially when examining non resource sectors belski is underweighting healthcare he prefers the u s and utilities rising yields low organic growth and high payout are a tough combination furthermore utilities rarely post back to back years of outperformance he says he is overweight in communication services energy and financials here s why canadian energy has underperformed the broader tsx for three consecutive years representing its worst three year period of relative performance from 1997 to 1999 we continue to believe wti remains stuck in a longer term range a perceived negative for canadian energy stocks however when solely examining historical price performance trends the decade of the 1980s is the only period when energy stocks underperformed the tsx for more than three consecutive years in fact the average relative performance following three or more consecutive years of underperformance is 1 6 furthermore when excluding the 1980s energy stocks exhibit an astounding 14 9 outperformance relative to the tsx therefore given our continued canadian energy favouritism relative to u s energy thanks to heightened cash flow dividends and management prowess we believe there is a very good chance that the sector can snap its string of negative performance in 2020 given the sector s outperformance cash flow earnings and dividend prowess we remain quite frankly mind boggled as to the overwhelming negativity encompassing the financials sector as such we remain overweight canadian financials and instead choose to focus on the adage of don t let the nonfacts get in the way of a good story desjardins global asset management expect between 4 6 returns from the tsx 3 from bonds desjardins expects canadian gdp growth to slow down to 1 5 in 2020 from 1 6 in 2019 while the u s economy will grow by 1 6 in 2020 a significant slowdown from the 2 3 growth registered in 2019 inflation will remain below 2 in both canada and the u s at 1 7 and 1 9 respectively desjardins expects no change from the bank of canada and the federal reserve as far as key lending rates are concerned yields for canadian bonds maturing in 10 years should stay fairly low with a forecast for the end of 2020 at 1 5 currently at 1 66 expected returns in 2020 money markets 2 canadian bonds 3 s p tsx 4 6 s p 500 4 6 source desjardins fiera capital candice bangsund vice president and portfolio manager underweight fixed income overweight equities our expectation for an eventual détente and potentially de escalation in the us china trade war should revitalize global growth prospects heading into 2020 and remove a key overhang that s been plaguing sentiment and growth these favourable developments will be compounded further by the lagged impact of reflationary efforts from major central banks that ultimately prove successful in rejuvenating growth while policymakers have pledged their unrelenting support moving forward underweight fixed income we expect yield curves to steepen with only modest repricing at the short end of the curve as policymakers pursue a sidelined approach while central banks are likely done cutting rates barring a severe deterioration in the macro backdrop the bar for rate hikes remains high as policymakers maintain an increased tolerance for higher inflation until expectations become well anchored meanwhile the improved growth backdrop that fuels a modest revival in inflation expectations is expected to place upward pressure on the long end of the curve that being said the backup will be fairly modest by historical standards and will not destabilize economic or financial conditions thanks to the accommodative central bank impetus that anchors rates at the short end of the curve what s more bond investors have largely exaggerated economic softness in 2019 and bond bulls could find themselves in a vulnerable position as macroeconomic tensions subside with increased clarity on the global backdrop sparking an exodus out of bonds that are overvalued overbought and overcrowded with the unwind accentuating the upward move in bond yields in this environment we maintain our underweight allocation to fixed income within the asset class we maintain a short duration positioning while also looking further up the risk spectrum towards spread product and inflation protection both of which should thrive in the pro cyclical environment of negligible recession default risks and rising inflation expectations overweight equities equities have been resilient in the wake of the flurry of trade headlines and geopolitical risks this year year to date gains have predominately been driven by multiple expansion whereby investors bid up what they were willing to pay for equities given the string of pro growth measures from global central banks and speculation for an amicable outcome on trade looking ahead we expect equity markets to continue grinding higher on the combination of both multiple expansion and earnings growth notably stimulative central bank policies will help to nurture the recovery and extend the duration of the expansion which should ultimately increase what investors are willing to pay for equities meanwhile we expect earnings to play a more meaningful role going forward and momentum should improve on the back of a reinvigorated global growth backdrop with so much gloom on the state of the economy the bar is low for upside surprises to earnings forecasts and accordingly equity prices and while valuations have indeed risen in 2019 they are not yet in threatening territory especially given the low and in some cases negative interest rate environment that warrants above average valuations moreover with on edge investors spending most of 2019 piling into cash and bonds there s plenty of dry powder prime for redeployment back into the equity space should investors embrace that the worst is indeed behind us the canadian equity market remains an appealing place to invest with the s p tsx trading at a steep discount to the s p 500 with close to two thirds of the index concentrated in cyclically levered value sectors the tsx is a prime candidate for further upside from here blackrock canada kurt reiman chief investment strategist the improved global cyclical backdrop ample fiscal and monetary policy space very reasonable valuations and a conservative estimate for 2020 canadian earnings suggest a potential for canadian equities to outperform our first theme growth edges up heralds a modest pickup in global growth this provides a decent tailwind to canadian economic activity after a year of steadily slowing global growth we think canadian growth can remain steady next year especially if industrial production and manufacturing have reached a bottom and trend higher our second theme policy pause calls for economic fundamentals to drive global markets rather than monetary surprises or fiscal stimulus we think the same frame broadly applies to canada but would note that canada has greater monetary and fiscal policy flexibility than other developed markets in the unlikely event the economy hits a rough patch the bank of canada boc now boasts the highest policy rate in the developed world and never resorted to balance sheet expansion this gives the boc much more ammunition to respond to soft economic readings at a time when global financial conditions have already eased we have been skeptical of canadian stocks and their potential to outperform the u s in recent years but now take a more constructive view the improved global cyclical backdrop ample fiscal and monetary policy space and a willingness among policymakers to use it very reasonable valuations in this edition we also upgrade value to neutral and a conservative estimate for 2020 canadian earnings suggest a potential for canadian equities to outperform next year we would also note that the dividend yield of the s p tsx composite index is nearly twice the level of the 10 year canadian government bond yield which further enhances the allure of equities stable to firmer oil prices a modest uptick in global economic growth and a moderately pro risk investment stance would tend to support the canadian dollar however there s a chance the bank of canada could cut rates if it viewed currency appreciation as a threat to the economy therefore we expect the loonie to trade in its long standing range between the mid to upper 70 cent level given this we retain our preference for unhedged currency exposure to global stocks as a structural volatility dampener for canadian investors
the odds of the u s slipping into a recession in 2020 are getting longer the probability of a downturn has fallen to about 1 in 3 following a tentative trade war truce with china and a resilient job market but that doesn t mean there won t be one here s the good news economists believe a recession that starts next year would probably be relatively short and mild more like the slumps of the early 1990s and early 2000s than the devastating collapse that led to nearly 9 million job losses during the great recession of 2007 09 that s largely because consumer finances are in good shape and there s little sign of the excesses like runaway inflation or housing or stock market bubbles that triggered previous slides the balance sheets of households businesses and banks remain strong says cristian deritis deputy chief economist at moody s analytics we have the capacity to absorb a recession restructure and see growth recover think of the 10½ year old economic expansion as a slow but steady jogger who gradually stumbles to a halt in the latter stages of a marathon but can quickly resume the race after a brief rest by contrast the mid 2000s economy that ended with the great recession was a sprinter who burned out and crashed dairy farmers milk new opportunities struggling dairy farmers building a future with hazelnuts specialty milk and creative thinking here s the rub the recovery from a recession that begins late next year is likely to be tepid as well partly held back by some of the same forces that cause the downturn it ll be a mild recession with a mild recovery says diane swonk chief economist of grant thornton a report by deritis shows the 11 recessions since world war ii can be grouped into three categories from 1948 to 1968 the u s experienced classic boom and bust downturns consumer and business spending surged prices soared and producers responded by making too much stuff leading to a shakeout and lower prices that revived demand story continues the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s were marked by oil price shocks that dampened consumer spending and downturns since the early 1990s largely have been set off by financial bubbles or run ups that eventually burst for some perspective on where a 2020 downturn might fit here s a look at the past three recessions in the financial bubble era july 1990 to march 1991 the eight month long downturn was at least partly sparked by savings and loans institutions that ratcheted up lending for risky commercial real estate projects that went bust resulting in the failure of a third of the s ls and discouraging housing and other loans other factors included a leap in oil prices after the u s invasion of kuwait and earlier federal reserve interest rate hikes to fight inflation economic output declined by about 1 2 and the unemployment rate rose from 5 2 to 6 8 as 1 4 million jobs were lost but even after the recession ended employers continued to cut jobs or hire sparingly pushing unemployment to 7 8 by june 1992 and creating the first jobless recovery march 2001 to november 2001 the eight month slump was triggered by the collapse of the dot com stock bubble which led to a pullback in business investment also contributing fed rate hikes to fight inflation in 2000 the september 11 terrorist attacks and the corporate accounting scandals of the early 2000s economic output actually increased slightly during this mild recession but the unemployment rate rose from 4 2 to 5 5 as 1 4 million jobs were shed after the downturn officially ended unemployment continued to climb to 6 3 by june 2003 and nearly 1 million more jobs were lost in another jobless recovery economists have partly blamed the jobless rebounds of the early 1990s and early 2000s on financial meltdowns that chilled lending and investment a study by the kansas city fed cites skittish employers who brought on temporary and part time workers and increased overtime instead of hiring more full time workers december 2007 to june 2009 the great recession the worst downturn since the great depression lasted 18 months and grew out of the risky mortgages banks provided to marginal borrowers when home prices fell homeowners couldn t refinance their loans leading to millions of foreclosures and pushing the nation s largest banks to the brink of failure lending dried up consumer spending tumbled and businesses laid off 8 7 million workers economic output fell by nearly 4 and the unemployment rate doubled to 10 by october 2009 job growth resumed in february 2010 but increased modestly for several years economic growth generally has been lackluster averaging 2 3 a year for years consumers and businesses spent cautiously and banks tightened lending standards though activity has picked up the past few years when claim social security benefits this social security mistake could result in a lifetime of regret study says the next recession unlike the past three recessions no widespread financial bubbles are likely to spark the next downturn and in contrast to 1990 and 2001 don t blame the fed after raising interest rates in 2018 the fed has cut rates three times this year to a historically low range of 1 5 to 1 75 amid low inflation and recession worries next time the culprits will almost certainly be jittery businesses deritis and swonk say president donald trump s trade war with china and a sluggish global economy have spawned uncertainty that has dampened business investment and clobbered manufacturing economists forecast growth of less than 2 in the current quarter and next year despite a tentative phase 1 u s trade deal with china larger conflicts with beijing remain unresolved and trump could eventually impose tariffs on 160 billion in chinese made consumer products that were planned for mid december but suspended because of the tentative agreement swonk says it likely would take such a shock to frighten companies into reining in hiring that has added a healthy 180 000 jobs a month this year that would dent consumer spending which makes up 70 of economic activity and has held up well amid solid job and wage growth and it could result in a recession scott anderson chief economist of bank of the west says it wouldn t necessarily take an escalation of the trade fight to tip the u s into a descent a 15 plunge in the record high stock market could spook households already on edge i think we re slouching toward recession he says if there is one deritis and swonk predict a relatively brief six month episode shorter than the past three and the 11 month average since world war ii deritis expects a 1 2 drop in economic output below the average 2 decline over the past 70 years he also sees the unemployment rate rising by 1 6 percentage points in line with a typical downturn about 600 000 jobs likely would be lost he says well below the millions that vanished during the past few recessions that doesn t mean there won t be pain less educated and other vulnerable workers are the most likely to be laid off the moody s paper says a big reason the next tailspin is likely to be mild is the chill cast by the great recession besides tighter credit standards banks maintain deep capital cushions as a result of post crisis regulations allowing them to continue lending to creditworthy customers and after peaking during the last downturn household debt as a share of gross domestic product has fallen to the lowest level since the early 2000s consumers will have greater resources available to manage their existing debts and increase their spending to support the economy deritis wrote in the report as prices for land equipment and labor fall enterprising businesses will likely scoop them up reigniting growth he says there are minefields that could extend the downturn corporate debt is at a record high with the biggest risks centered on companies with low credit ratings a recession could intensify if those firms default and start laying off workers swonk says perhaps more worrisome is that the upswing is likely to be uninspiring policymakers don t have the tools to generate a more robust recovery swonk says the fed which has cut interest rates an average of about five percentage points in previous recoveries won t have that luxury with its key short term rate at 1 5 to 1 75 though it almost certainly will resume bond purchases to lower long term rates and after trump took the unusual step of spearheading tax cuts and spending increases during the expansion helping push the national debt to 22 trillion congress may have less appetite for a big stimulus to dig out of a slump the economists say also global growth probably won t ramp up anytime soon deritis says continuing to squeeze american manufacturers that rely on exports it ll be a jobless recovery swonk says this article originally appeared on usa today the recession a 2020 downturn would be mild and so would a recovery
part one rage and fire 2018 i stopped in elementary school but i already knew how to shoot with a kalashnikov we were training in the neighborhood a basra resident former militiaman since the crash of the islamic state isis in autumn 2017 iraqi news has been regularly punctuated by episodes of demonstrations and riots on a background of basic social demands for access to electricity and drinking water and for jobs as well as denunciation of corruption among political staff however this context of peace and finally restored national harmony opened a period particularly favorable to initiate reforms and try to meet the immense social expectations of the population a precious political capital that the government has squandered in a few months through intense inaction the anger and frustration of the people are once again boundless the efforts and sacrifices made during the war against the caliphate were in vain over the months waves of mobilization violence and the determination of the demonstrators seem to be increasing riots fires and clashes with the security forces are increasingly shaking the country until october 2019 when the protest movement entered a new phase on a larger scale but with different practices while the government is more than ever in the spotlight we know however that the state will be preserved a country in ruins war after war ruins upon ruins from 2014 to 2017 the northern half of iraq with a sunni majority is once again ravaged by fighting first while being rapidly conquered by isis which stops 100 km north of baghdad then while being very slowly liberated the cost of destruction related to this conflict is estimated by the world bank at 45 7 billion in january 2018 in some areas everything is destroyed cities are almost razed to the ground in others there is no infrastructure left for example only 38 per cent of the country s schools are still standing and only half of the hospitals a city like mosul was liberated from isis only at the cost of 8 million tons of rubble and hundreds of thousands of displaced people the country s economy has obviously not been spared particularly the essential hydrocarbon sector which accounts for 88 of the country s budgetary resources 51 of gdp and 99 of its exports nevertheless iraq remains the second largest producer of crude oil within the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec after saudi arabia with an average production of 4 5 million barrels per day some infrastructure has suffered particularly for example the baiji refinery the largest in the country which only partially restarts in spring 2018 for several years iraq needs to import refined products including fuel gas and electricity from neighboring countries particularly from iran three quarters of the water infrastructure and half of the power plants are indeed destroyed according to region iraqis receive only five to eight hours of electricity a day and shortages of drinking water are chronic in baghdad for example a quarter of the population does not have access to drinking water agricultural production has also fallen particularly as a result of the destruction of irrigation systems exacerbating an already endemic rural exodus in 2018 the unemployment rate officially stands at 23 in iraq but it is estimated to reach 40 among young people those under 24 representing 60 of the population in fact there is relatively little work in iraq the first economic sector oil ultimately provides few jobs especially since foreign companies hire many asian migrants considered to be more docile and exploited at will than local workers the private sector remains weak and in reality there are only two branches of activity that provide jobs for the population firstly the civil service which has five million civil servants including retirees compared to half a million in 2003 secondly the violence sector with the iraqi army comprising approximately 200 000 men and the hashd al shaabi popular mobilization units pmu around 100 000 the latter which is a coalition of about fifty mostly shia militias recruited a lot in 2014 after the fatwa of grand ayatollah ali al sistani ordering the mobilization against isis troops tens of thousands of volunteers mostly unemployed responded to this call one third of them from the province of basra thousands died there and many returned injured sometimes amputated the end of the war against isis leads only to a partial demobilization of these troops a militiaman back in civilian life means for a family one less source of revenue and an extra mouth to feed in kuwait in february 2018 at a conference on the reconstruction of the country while the iraqi government was asking for more than 88 billion dollars the international community promised it only about 30 billion dollars in credits and investments in particular turkey kuwait saudi arabia and qatar but as a result of an exceptional corruption which is among the strongest in the world we know that a part of international aid as well as a part of the oil rent disappears into the pockets of local politicians successive governments have reportedly embezzled nearly 410 billion euros since saddam hussein s fall in 2003 which means twice the country s gdp on top of that as iraq at war has become familiar with debt in 2016 the country signed an agreement with the international monetary fund imf and in exchange for loans it committed itself to taking austerity measures drop in the number of civil servants increase in electricity prices increase in customs taxes and income taxes etc as we can see in iraq the years of liberation and reconstruction are unlikely to one day be considered glorious disappointment frustration and anger of the inhabitants seem as great as before the caliphate episode either because they certainly get no benefit for it ruined or displaced veterans or civilians or because they have once again lost everything isis supporters sunnis humiliated by the shia occupation it seems we are back to the status quo ante or worse the premises of the revolt 2011 2015 during the arab springs of 2011 thousands of iraqis took to the streets of many cities to express their anger against an already corrupt regime and deplorable living conditions the movement was quickly and violently repressed by prime minister nouri al maliki at the cost of dozens of people killed whereas the security situation seemed at all levels definitively restored american troops left the country at the end of the year subsequently the sunni provinces experienced new episodes of protest and the government s responses were the same a policing response enough to enhance the breeding ground for the growth of isis and to explain that a part of the population will welcome it in 2014 as a liberator despite the war popular demonstrations against corruption supported by part of the shia clergy broke out in baghdad in july 2015 they were mainly led by supporters of the thundering muqtada al sadr but in the south of the country in basra and kerbala it s mainly the repeated power cuts that bring people onto the streets to calm things down prime minister haider al abadi who has been in office since 2014 merely promised reforms that do not come iraqis anger boiled over once again from february to may 2016 the green zone baghdad s ultra secure perimeter hosting official buildings was even briefly invaded and the parliament was occupied by sadrist demonstrators in february 2017 another attempt to occupy it ended this time in failure four dead and dozens wounded in front of the green zone on the opposite bank of the tigris tahrir square becomes a symbolic place of protest from now on usually on friday after the prayer we can see handfuls of activists and protesters gathering waving posters and holding meetings but the epicenter of the proletarian revolt lies further south venice adrift the south east province has a population of about five million but its capital basra alone has three to four million inhabitants in theory it is one of the wealthiest regions in the country if not in the world since nearly 80 of iraqi oil is extracted from there more than in neighboring kuwait the agglomeration is hosting a significant petrochemical activity and in its suburbs the only iraqi ports overlooking the persian gulf including the deep water port of umm qasr 50 km further south it is from this point completely saturated that commodities including foodstuffs enter iraq and millions of barrels of oil are exported daily many foreign investors are present in the city e g french or italian shipping companies and studies for new industrial and logistical infrastructures are not lacking nor indeed the pharaonic real estate projects that seem to be the most delirious construction of five star hotels high end residential units shopping malls business district with the world s tallest tower 230 floors to rival the likes of dubai as some expect in the meantime real economic activity brings millions of dollars a day to the iraqi state almost nothing to the region and even less to its people the province of basra has long been a major agricultural area renowned for its date palm trees the shatt al arab estuary which was a treasure of ecology wealth and developed a lush agriculture has turned into an ecological hell devastated by decades of war laying concrete and industrial pollution with an ad hoc incidence of cancer for its population but worse between the rise in sea level due to global warming and the decrease in river flow due to intensive irrigation construction of dams in turkey and iran wasteful use in iraq we are now witnessing an increasing salinization of land and groundwater a few weeds are scattered over the cracked piece of land in the past everything was very green here i used to grow vegetables fodder for my animals dates and apples with his four hectares of land his herd of about thirty sheep and his few cows this farmer could earn up to 25 million dinars a year about 20 000 but this year i lost everything nothing will grow i have three children to feed so to survive i sell my animals faced with the shortage of fresh water this 60 year old man must now fill their drinking troughs with water bottles recently the government had to ban crops that consume too much freshwater such as maize and rice this contributes as do the expropriations of peasants for the extension of oil infrastructure to a major rural exodus that feeds the slums and informal neighborhoods in the suburbs of basra the city s population has increased by more than one million since 2003 the pace of job creation didn t of course follow and a third of the population now lives below the poverty line i e on less than 2 a day the city s majestic canals which used to be called the venice of the middle east now look like open sewers and floating dumpsites its inhabitants have little or no access to basic public services such as running water electricity or waste management in an attempt to overcome these problems the governorate of basra has directly signed agreements with neighboring countries kuwait thus supplies fuel to iraqi power plants on a daily basis but it is first of all out of fear of seeing waves of migrants crossing its border electricity supply from iran is subject to risks such as american sanctions or payment difficulties saudi arabia which wants yet to counter tehran s influence has so far made do with promises that does not mean that the inhabitants of basra are resigned but it is true that the region retains traces of a tradition of struggle particularly trade unionist and that in the past the influence of marxist political movements was very important there iraqi political shiism assimilated as many of those aspects as possible in the second half of the 20th century to counter the communist influence relying in particular on the pro social justice veneer provided by this religion an insurrection like in 1991 against saddam hussein s regime remains almost mythical in many memories the provincial capital is therefore not understandably renowned for its social stability and demonstrations are a part of everyday life there the july riots electricity iraqi news in the summer of 2018 should been dominated by new political developments following the parliamentary elections in may the result of this election which saw a record abstention of more than 55 was only a fragmented parliament with no clear majority the saairun coalition literally forward but also known as alliance towards reforms or marching towards reform which could be described as populist and nationalist obtained the highest percentage of the vote it was an unprecedented alliance of shia supporters of the sovereignist muqtada al sadr and the modest iraqi communist party the latter however had only 2 deputies out of 54 elected of the coalition in the second place there is the fatah alliance conquest alliance orthodox shia and politically inspired by the iranian model the party it is led by hadi al amiri political branch of the pmu and it derives its legitimacy from its active participation in the fight against isis the party of prime minister al abadi the islamic dawa party is only in the third place if a priori it seems hard to reconcile one political bloc with another at least two of them must join their forces in order to appoint a prime minister and share the power this is particularly complex since they must respect ethno confessional quotas in the distribution of posts and finally upset neither tehran nor washington it is after a month of spectacular negotiations and reversals that the first step is over an agreement to form a government has finally been reached between haider al abadi and muqtada al sadr but while politicians in the air conditioned palaces of the green zone are now feverishly fighting for the allocation of ministries basra s inhabitants are facing the most serious water crisis in iraq as well as frightening heat waves with temperatures above 50 c fans air conditioners and refrigerators become more than essential but for that you need electricity and now on july 6th due to unpaid bills iran is simply closing several power lines including the one that supplies basra the proletarians noting that shia solidarity has limits are forced to use their age old costly and polluting generators as for the iraqi authorities they find no other solution than to ask the inhabitants to save energy two days later on sunday july 8th a demonstration of a quite common kind took place on the outskirts of basra a few dozen people blocked a road leading to the west qurna 2 oil field operated by the russian company lukoil and west qurna 1 oil field operated by exxonmobil thus preventing employees from accessing the sites they hoped to get some hires in this way but the situation had escalated and a demonstrator was shot dead by the police at that moment no one knows that this event will set off the powder keg it seems that initially the local tribal sheikhs sought justice and reparation and then they received support from other tribes demonstrations resume the following tuesday the next day protesters attempted to enter oil installations near basra they clashed with security forces and set fire to buildings at the site entrance the tension is such that foreign oil companies are ordering the evacuation of their executives over the next two days demonstrations took place in several cities in the south of the country basra nasiriya najaf samawa and karbala and even in baghdad in many cases protesters were trying to block economically strategic roads linking for instance oil fields border crossings to prevent the passage of trucks airports and the port of umm qasr official buildings were occupied in several cities there were clashes with the police and injuries on friday 13th prime minister haider al abadi travelled to basra where he met with military political tribal and economic leaders and tried to calm the population by announcing without further explanation that he would release the necessary funds for the city during the friday sermon grand ayatollah ali al sistani faithful to his lukewarm balancing supported the demonstrators but asked them to avoid disorder and destruction however at nightfall riots broke out in several cities the protesters although very respectful of their cleric chose to ignore his recommendations and on the contrary targeted official buildings offices of political parties and militias except sadrist organizations and sometimes even tried to set them on fire fighting with the police raged all night long eight demonstrators were killed throughout the following week these demonstrations were repeated and extended to other provinces in the south of the country what do these demonstrators want above all water electricity better public services and jobs a 25 year old man a graduate of the university of basra says we want jobs we want to drink clean water and electricity we want to be treated like human beings and not animals another man a 29 year old employee says people are hungry and live without water and electricity our demands are simple more jobs desalination structures and the construction of power plants to these basic material demands the demonstrators add a vague but virulent denunciation of corruption and all those thieves who rule the country slogans a little more explicitly political also appear such as the people want the regime to fall throughout the week the anger that is expressed also took on sovereignist tones and the demonstrators then also shouted out iran out free baghdad the shia parties which have been in power for years are indeed associated with iran and its far reaching impact on the country the symbols of the islamic republic very present in the south of the country served as outlets for the rioters rage for example banners and panels in tribute to khomeini the founder of the islamic republic of iran were set on fire who are these demonstrators first of all they are exclusively men especially young sometimes very young poor proletarians and unemployed including young graduates those under 35 representing 70 of the population demonstrations are quite spontaneous they do not respond to the call of any party or trade union no leader emerges from them and even if locally rallies can be initiated by militants or tribal sheikhs they quickly become uncontrollable at first the mobilization seems to concern only the shias who anyway represent 60 of the population the regions of the country and the neighborhoods of the capital where they are in the majority but it soon becomes clear that the mobilization actually goes beyond community divisions that sunnis participate in it and that some mixed regions are in turn affected from the beginning the anger of the demonstrators targeted the political elite and its symbols and the seats of the authorities such as governorates town halls or courthouses the offices of political parties were regularly attacked ransacked and burned down these young proletarians use violence quite naturally spontaneously and impulsively this can easily be explained by the harshness of iraqi daily life by the brutalization that years of war have caused society to suffer in the sense of george l mosse but also by a popular culture that trivializes violence the iraqi government prefers to denounce the presence of vandals infiltrated into the processions however this immoderate use of violence seems to be spreading or at least to be accepted by other categories of demonstrators as the journalist hélène sallon points out this willingness to violence was later shared by many demonstrators people who were not necessarily from this angry and very young generation told me well yes because we don t have any other choice they don t listen to us they only make promises on promises and so at some point yes why not violence how would it be without the constant calls for moderation from political and religious authorities the journalist nevertheless notes a weaker mobilization in baghdad perhaps because of the impact muqtada al sadr has there on a portion of the proletariat but undoubtedly also because of a gap between militants and young proletarians who take to the streets in baghdad we see that this movement too was not a great success because i have the impression that the protest there is much more politicized in line with parties and anyway we have seen in the demonstrations this summer some divergences between these long time activists more politicized and more attached to parties and this new generation that they could not understand and whose intentions they were not sure of we have seen a greater difficulty in baghdad for the movement to make a mix rather than in basra or najaf where socio economic reasons are shared by all the authorities overwhelmed react in urgency and disorder becoming only gradually aware of the extent of the revolt for them it is primarily a matter of limiting the destruction hence the introduction of a night curfew and the deployment of riot police using tear gas and water cannons but quickly the army must contribute to protection of the oil facilities in which protesters regularly threaten to enter in order to limit mobilization the internet is interrupted several times throughout the country sometimes for several days total cuts or sometimes only targeting social networks prime minister al abadi publicly adopts a conciliatory position towards the demonstrators he claimed to have understood their legitimate demands and he asserts that he wants to protect the right to demonstrate peacefully he also pledges to accelerate water and electricity projects in the south he invites tribal leaders delegations to come and meet him and he announces an immediate allocation of 3 billion for the basra region he can hardly count on the support of his ally muqtada al sadr although now with one foot in the green zone the latter hopes as usual surfing the protest without actually calling his supporters to take to the streets the fearless shia leader does not hesitate to use the twitter s hashtag the hunger revolution wins cautiously he asks demonstrators to show restraint and not to attack public buildings after more than eight days of demonstrations and probably much hesitation believing that the movement will continue he calls on his deputies to suspend negotiations on the formation of a new government until the demonstrators demands are met the day of july 20th appears to be a turning point it seems that in front of the police and military forces heavily deployed in the southern provinces and in the capital the demonstrators avoided confrontation and gather in the main public squares in baghdad several thousand demonstrators were nevertheless trying to approach the green zone but the police pushed them back the demonstrations which have become much less violent continue until sunday 22nd it is at this moment that the movement ends after fourteen days of demonstrations throughout the south of the country including at least eight days of riots the repression killed 11 people most of them shot dead such mobilization violence and repression appear to be unprecedented in iraq september riots water one might think that after such uprising the government would be able to enjoy a soothing respite but that s not the case everything starts again in basra this time because of the water due to the deplorable health and meteorological conditions the water distributed by the authorities has proven to be from august onwards much more salty and polluted than usual in a few weeks its consumption even causes intoxication and hospitalization of more than 30 000 people as always the government responds by going through the motions imagining that the suspension of the minister of electricity and a few officials will be enough to calm the confrontation and will allow the green zone to resume its picturesque daily course however on sunday september 2nd hundreds of demonstrators blocked various strategic points in basra province the next day in baghdad the inaugural meeting of the parliament elected in may was held the alliance between muqtada al sadr and prime minister haider al abadi on the one hand and that of the leader of the pro iranian militias hadi al amiri and former prime minister nouri al maliki on the other are tearing each other apart but they failed to elect a speaker of the council of representatives on tuesday several thousand people gather in basra to protest against the authorities negligence the police shot into the air and used tear gas to disperse them clashes broke out at the end of the day six people were killed there are even more protesters on wednesday on thursday september 6th access to the port of umm qasr was blocked by demonstrators and in the evening in basra rioters attacked public buildings and political parties headquarters they even tried to attack the iranian consulate but they were repelled by the security forces fearing that demonstrations may be triggered after the friday prayer which takes place at noon the authorities deploy numerous police forces to basra and set up a curfew in the city from 4 p m but if during the day protesters try to enter one of the oil sites near the city and others block umm qasr s access again it is at nightfall that the situation escalates residents gathered on the streets and in ever increasing numbers they quickly attacked government buildings party and militia premises the regional governor s offices and residence and they burned down everything that might be what makes a whole lot of noise including at the international level is that the iranian consulate is stormed for the second time and that this time it went up in smoke during the night three more demonstrators were shot dead by the police the following day saturday september 8th is particularly calm in comparison the port of umm qasr resumes its activities and the police watch some activists claiming to be organizers of the protests denounce the destruction of the previous day and announce that they are stopping the movement the curfew was finally lifted in the evening it should be noted that for the first time the commander of the pmu declares that his troops are ready to deploy in the streets of basra to ensure security and protect peaceful demonstrators against agents provocateurs the government is once again promising to release funds without giving any amount or timetable although no one has yet seen the shadow of the 3 billion promised in july on the same day parliament met in an emergency session in order to discuss the crisis in basra but part of the assembly including the fatah alliance political wing of the pmu called for the resignation of prime minister al abadi but in a dramatic turn of events this call was echoed by muqtada al sadr an ally of al abadi until then the sovereignist leader thus suggests an alliance with the pro iranian bloc this turnaround was facilitated by grand ayatollah ali al sistani s highly critical stance towards the prime minister he was finally forced to throw in the towel and adel abdel mahdi a former oil minister was appointed to succeed him he did not take office until october 25th 2018 the situation is still somewhat confusing but while some denounce the recent riots as the result of a plot aimed at countering iranian influence it seems paradoxically that the pro iranian bloc will be strengthened as a result nothing that a priori could satisfy the protesters of whom in less than a week thirteen were killed and dozens more wounded nothing that would indicate an improvement in their material living conditions however the demonstrations did not resume calm returned and daily life is getting back to normal in basra and baghdad for how long everyone is waiting for the next explosion and remains on guard but no one s realized yet that it will take about a year to see the iraqi proletarians once again taking to the streets equipped with their incendiary anger tristan leoni november 2019 source in french english translation friends of the class war part two 2019 political reform or civil war after the revolts of october 2018 iraq experienced twelve months of relative calm however basically the economic and social situation remained broadly the same iraq didn t experience a new wave of protests until october 2019 which initially turned out to be very similar to the previous one what is new however is the magnitude and intensity of the mobilization the level of violence used by the demonstrators and the level of repression after a break of a few weeks due to a shiite pilgrimage the protest which looked like extinguished resumed but appeared to be transformed on both form and content and both in terms of demands and sociology of the participants as the weeks passed and despite the deaths the fatigue and the phases of retreat the movement continues in a quasi routine of demonstrations and riots but it can t find a way out although the prime minister has promised to meet the demands of the protesters he was forced to throw in the towel at the end of november plunging iraq further into uncertainty at the time of writing the mobilization continues prime minister adil abdul mahdi who came to power in october 2018 following the proletarian revolt in basra that had caused the departure of his predecessor promised to introduce changes and fight corruption but as it looks like a habit he didn t outline any significant reforms it is true that political agendas are not dictated by economic and social considerations but more prosaically by business and political rivalries however the latter are a part of the opposition between washington and tehran which has been particularly strong since may 2018 and the american withdrawal from the agreement on iranian nuclear power 1 from removal to riot september 29th october 5th there is always a spark for a mobilization to be triggered a pretext to take to the streets a step too far that leads to a shift even if this first cause quickly becomes outdated or even forgotten at the end of september baghdad grappled with student demonstrations which were rather classically repressed by the government and the date of sunday september 29th is considered as the starting point of the movement several hundred people gathered on that day to protest against the removal of abdul wahab al saadi that happened two days earlier this commander of the iraqi counter terrorism service a national hero in the fight against isis is very popular in some parts of the population for his detractors he is above all the man of the united states within the military apparatus the affair caused a very strong mobilization on the internet notably via twitter with the hashtag we are all abdul wahab al saadi two days later demonstrations broke out in several cities across the country in baghdad the meeting point for the protesters is obviously tahrir square in front of the green zone on the opposite bank of the tigris river the removal is long gone and the participants take up the iraqi classic slogans for the improvement of basic services for job creation or against corruption reminiscent of the revolt of 2018 one demonstrator said all we want is to live and nothing else we want to live just like the rest of the world we want very basic rights electricity water employment and medicine we don t want power money or property all we ask for is to live and another added i am out of work i want to get married i have only 250 dinars less than a quarter of a dollar in my pocket and state officials have millions as the protesters attempted to cross the al jumariyah bridge which separates them from the green zone they were welcomed by water cannons and tear gas canisters to which they responded with stones and by constructing barricades of sorts with burning tires and garbage but the police also used live ammunition two demonstrators were killed one in baghdad and another in nasiriya and more than 200 others were injured the next day wednesday october 2nd military and security forces were massively deployed in baghdad the main roads were blocked by armored vehicles concrete blocks and barbed wire the internet was cut off throughout the country except in kurdistan the authorities targeting facebook twitter and whatsapp hoped to put a stop to the mobilization demonstrators nevertheless gathered in tahrir square and in several provincial towns including basra najaf nasiriya wasit and diwaniyah in baghdad the road leading to the airport west of the city was blocked with burning tyres clashes erupted in several localities where buildings symbolizing power as well as the premises of political parties and militias were stormed at least seven demonstrators were killed while denouncing the actions of rioters and infiltrators among peaceful demonstrators the authorities imposed curfews in several cities but nothing helped demonstrations were now daily throughout the south of the country and they turned into riots usually at nightfall in baghdad tahrir square became in a few days an attachment point from which the demonstrators tried to reach the green zone by forcing their way onto the bridge over the tigris river but the almost 500 meters of the bridge were heavily defended by the police and segmented by several concrete barriers over which both sides are fighting for control on the first days battles sometimes took place around the square for example on october 3rd in a square 500 meters further north where two armored vehicles of the security forces were set on fire by the rioters but the violence was thereafter restricted to the bank of the tigris river this large scale mobilization in the very heart of the capital is a new development compared to the events of 2018 after a few days the movement takes on an anti system aspect and there is now in addition to the demands of a basic economic nature a very explicit demand for the government to resign but what political force could pick up the slack and in the process satisfy the protesters just as in 2018 the government seems to be overwhelmed by the violence of the uprising and clumsily juggles between carrot and stick a complete curfew was imposed in baghdad and in several regions and civil servants i e the majority of workers were told to stay off the streets despite orders urging to show restraint members of the security forces frequently use their kalashnikov to frighten the demonstrators sometimes also to hit the most determined of them or to get out of complicated situations because fighting has been particularly bitter and as of october 3rd 31 people have been already killed including two policemen which is not a little thing two days later the death toll was already 100 dead and 4 000 wounded during this period there were many arrests but the protesters were usually released after a few hours in exchange for signing a promise not to take to the streets again on the carrot side prime minister adel abdul mahdi explained to the protesters that their legitimate demands have been heard and that they can go home he announced ambitious social measures including unemployment benefits the construction of 100 000 housing units and subsidized land distribution but didn t set a timetable he committed to meet with demonstrators to hear their demands and stated that those killed during the demonstrations will be considered as martyrs which means that their families will be eligible for various benefits for his part the very influential muqtada al sadr is hesitating as always between praising the order the power where he now has a foot inside and questioning the establishment he denounced the violence of the security services and called on his supporters to organize peaceful sit ins but on october 4th another acrobatic u turn he is now demanding nothing less than the resignation of the government which his coalition had however brought to power and the organization of early elections on sunday the 6th the mobilization of the police was impressive and that of the protesters very limited processions were prevented from reaching tahrir square what led to clashes particularly in the sadr city district where many demonstrators were killed or injured the next day calm returned the internet was restored and the protest ended the official toll for this week of violence was 157 dead including 8 police officers and about 6 000 injured in addition 51 public buildings and 8 political party headquarters were burned down never seen before the sudden end of the protests is not in itself unprecedented as social movements sometimes die in an unexplained way and commentators then try in vain to determine the cause the western media have generally not taken an interest in it but this sudden interruption can be easily explained by the weight of religion the celebration of arba een which was to take place this year on october 19th and 20th this shiite pilgrimage part of which is made on foot attracts millions of believers from all over the world but mostly iraqis going to the holy city of kerbala during this period the south of the country is paralyzed shiite towns and villages empty and roads are filled with masses of pilgrims police and army are massively deployed to ensure security but politics is never far away on october 20th some pilgrims wave iraqi flags and chant free baghdad corrupt go out or no to america no to israel no to corruption muqtada al sadr indeed asked his supporters to give an anti corruption aspect to this day 2 from riot to reform october 25th 27th after arba een day these millions of pilgrims have yet to leave for things getting back to normal this will not quite be the case as early as the 21st iraqi security forces were beginning to erect fortifications around the green zone indeed some people have already planned that the social turmoil new season will begin on friday october 25th when leaving the mosques on the anniversary of the prime minister s inauguration calls to demonstrate on that day and meetings were multiplying on social networks at the initiative of civil society activists muqtada al sadr cautiously informed his supporters that they have the right to participate in these gatherings the deadline given by grand ayatollah ali al sistani to the government to respond to the demands of the october demonstrators and to shed light on the violence they have suffered also expired on this date to make matters worse the commission charged with investigating these events gave its conclusions a few days earlier and announced the dismissal of some officers nothing that can calm a population obsessed by rumors about plots and the presence of snipers on the contrary anger is growing and in anticipation many iraqis were stockpiling food and fuel on friday 25th in his sermon the grand ayatollah urged the security forces and demonstrators to show restraint in the early afternoon the mobilization was impressive some protesters occupied the rooftops of buildings which are reported likely to host snipers including an 18 storey derelict tower overlooking tahrir square and the al jumariyah bridge known as the turkish restaurant demonstrations took place in several cities in the south of the country including basra wasit nasiriya najaf karbala samawah amarah and diwaniyah economic demands were still very present there water electricity jobs health we noted the remarkable participation particularly pictured of some women including unveiled women in the midst of thousands of male demonstrators one of them said i want my share of the oil in the capital protesters approaching the green zone were repelled clashes erupted in many cities a part of the basra governorate building was torched and two police cars suffered the same fate the safwan border crossing was blocked and burnt down the premises of a militia group were attacked with a grenade in amarah resulting in two deaths during the day at least 27 attacks and burnings of official buildings took place across the country not counting attacks on party offices or houses of political leaders the toll of the day is particularly heavy and unprecedented 63 dead and 2 300 wounded most of them were demonstrators shot dead by live ammunition from the security forces or hit by flat trajectory fires of tear gas some were reportedly killed by militiamen defending their premises several people also died in building fires several provinces were under curfew in baghdad as the confrontation with the police dragged on rioters ended up erecting tents in tahrir square so that they can spend the night there and have not to reclaim the square the next day not far away pick ups filled with armed men of the sadrist militia the saraya al salam peace brigades ex mahdi army were deployed to protect the demonstrators a presence far from reassuring everyone they withdrew after twenty four hours the next day demonstrations riots and attacks on buildings resumed in the southern half of the country they are now daily from day to day the movement spread even to other provinces hitherto relatively unscathed where the shiites are in the minority there are reports of student demonstrations in cities such as tikrit mostly sunni or more symbolically in mosul kurdistan while the gatherings were generally peaceful they frequently turned into riots in the evening the curfew appeared to be a poor deterrent with protesters sometimes even waiting for it to start before taking to the streets in baghdad the demonstrators focused the attention on the bridge that connects tahrir square to the green zone armed with stones and more rarely with molotov cocktails they tried to push back the police the dead and wounded were numerous sunday october 27th was a turning point in the mobilization during this new week university and high school students joined the movement including religious students from the holy city of najaf the following day the teachers union called for a national strike lasting several days in solidarity it was joined by the lawyers doctors dentists and engineers unions in many localities pickets and sit ins were set up in front of the entrances to government buildings to obstruct their functioning the sociological composition of the movement is therefore changing we have no longer to deal only with poor young proletarians from deprived suburbs it is therefore no coincidence that the demands are changing whereas until now they were above all material and very basic and in addition there was only a furious hatred of the corrupt the order of priorities has changed for the first time the press echoed testimonies completely at odds with what we have been hearing since 2018 such as that one of this demonstrator in baghdad we have lost our country we do not want land electricity or water we want to be free and we want to overthrow this government or this 24 year old street medic on tahrir square our demands are clear change the electoral law and hold a new election that allows us to elect the person we want not a party that makes agreements behind closed doors to decide our future according to their own self interests demands are confused and various but consequently the most highlighted demands include the resignation of all the people in government the revision of the electoral law and the constitution the end of a system based on ethnicity and confessional identity the decrease in the number of deputies early elections a reduction in the party power a government of technocrats a presidential regime etc the impression is henceforth that there are many more demonstrators and that the protest becomes good natured almost joyful indeed at the end of october a slight decrease in violence was perceptible the official toll at that time was 100 dead and 5 500 injured in addition 98 buildings were damaged or burned down but it was no longer a question of simply expressing rage by burning everything within reach political reform is now the motto an issue with regard to which capital can make immediate and low cost concessions a comfort issue 3 the form of the movement occupy on the tigris river while a few tents were erected in tahrir square during the very first days to provide a first aid post rest areas or dining spaces the aim was behind the lines to provide logistical support to those in the front line 300 meters further who were trying to force their way onto the al jumariyah bridge two parallel phenomena gradually emerged on one hand the clashes on this bridge decreased in intensity and turned into a phony war for protecting symbolically the demonstrators gathered in the square on the other hand the organization expanded rapidly inhabitants and businesspeople and shop keepers otherwise ordinary citizens who cannot join the demonstrations because they are working were bringing food and water in solidarity and it became necessary to manage logistics to organize the preparation and distribution of meals especially as free food attracts the poorest inhabitants of the capital as well as equipment masks helmets the turkish restaurant became an annex to the square and dormitories were built on some floors handymen made the necessary connections to supply the square with water and electricity the first improvised medical aid stations gave way to an infirmary with volunteer doctors nurses and pharmacists then to a real hospital the tuk tuks provide transport for the wounded soon dozens of tents were erected covering the entire square and overflowing onto the adjacent roads the square is transformed into a meeting place for activists unionists tribal representatives members of the civil society or the educated middle class onlookers etc there are a multitude of stands where everyone associations unions corporations artists express their demands giving the square the appearance of an anti globalization camp a tent becomes a militant library another a revolutionary cinema hall here one can write proposals for amending the constitution there a stand promotes the made in iraq against products made in iran next to a vendor of tricolor flags a legal office or a stand of the communist party of iraq for their part street artists decorate the walls with political mural paintings as the days passed the square became a more comfortable living space restaurants and street vendors are expanding rapidly hairdressers and barbers set up shop and of course prayer rooms are opened but it is also about keeping busy because days and nights are long hence the gigs and chess tournaments and then there is the sport runners organized a mini marathon volleyball courts and football fields were marked out on football match nights as part of the 2022 world cup qualifiers a huge crowd are watching the game on a giant screen and when iraq won the match the party went on all night long although a memorial devoted to protesters killed the atmosphere is festive and good natured as in beirut the song baby shark is on track to becoming the not very warlike anthem of the square this style of camp can be found on a smaller scale in other cities notably in basra and nasiriya the organization is intended to be beyond reproach because for some people it should reflect the image they have of the ideal iraq and they evoke a mini state on the square so groups of volunteers sweep the streets and collect garbage hence also the question of security in the first days demonstrators set up roadblocks around the square in order to redirect traffic then a security service was set up for controlling every entrance into the square people are searched to prevent weapons and dangerous items to be smuggled if necessary suspicious individuals are reported to the police who patrol the adjacent streets with the agreement of the occupants the shops with closed curtains and warehouses around the square are secured by stewards to prevent theft or looting while many took pride in the fact that women with strollers could safely move around the square the most determined proletarians were told to get out the women another significant fact is that since october 27th women who were until then absent from the mobilization have become involved in the demonstrations although they are still in an extremely small minority they are most often female university and high school students moving as a group frequently all girl groups their processions are sometimes protected and supervised by men their presence is most visible of course in the center of the capital tahrir square but women may be in the majority in the community kitchen first aid stand and street art these women and girls have helped the injured carried the wounded provided food and supplies painted inspiring slogans on walls washed clothes and cleaned the streets while they do more than that the division of labor and space allocation remains much gendered this involvement is a new development in iraq where since the 1990s and especially since 2003 and the growing islamization of society the situation of women is getting worse at all levels social educational legal labor violence etc some people consider that the 2019 movement can help to change the traditional view held by many iraqis and iraqi women particularly that one which excludes women from political life from this point of view it is noteworthy that women present in tahrir square are not victims of widespread sexual harassment or violence unlike what happened for example in 2011 in cairo s tahrir square however one may wonder what the situation is beyond the center of baghdad where activists students and young people from the middle class are concentrated among others all the more so it should be remembered female participation remains very minority in the provinces demonstrations often have an even more male dominated feature while some of the country s major cities have had camps similar to that of tahrir square the southern half of the country is known for its conservatism and tribal traditions are dominant there particularly as regards women need to show humility arranged marriages dowry system honor killings etc women especially students who are going to demonstrate often have to face family pressure some of them use surgical masks very common among protesters to avoid being recognized on the other hand as soon as the situation becomes tenser as soon as clashes break out we no longer see any woman in the streets rioting in iraq is a man s affair it s obviously not a question of bravery by the way more than 99 of the demonstrators killed are men insurgency what is striking is the contrast between the festive atmosphere of tahrir square transformed into a carnival like hub and the harshness of the clashes taking place 500 meters away after a few days of occupation the mass of demonstrators was such that they overflowed the square and gradually took over the bank of the tigris river upstream of the al jumariyah bridge due to the increasing formalism on tahrir square the bridge ceased to be a point through which one tried to reach the green zone henceforth everyone defended their positions in an impressive confrontation that was like a show the protesters took possession of a first concrete barrier and each side stood in a sheltered position the most radical elements left therefore the square and tried to block or even to cross the three bridges located further north al sinak al ahrar and al shuhada the police forces tried to prevent them from doing so many fights took place in al khalani square and al rasheed street strategic places for access to this sector they were generally very violent with rioters very young men throwing stones often with slingshots and molotov cocktails at the police who responded with tear gas stones and sometimes molotov cocktails the sloppy appearance of the security forces was sometimes such that one had the impression of watching two rival gangs fighting each other armed with sticks except that one of them had kalashnikovs under these conditions a day of rioting without death or serious injuries is a miracle several members of the police forces also died in the course of the clashes in the capital however the confrontation keeps a symbolic and a ritualized aspect it does not extend beyond the district north of tahrir square there is no destruction almost no looting and no attempts to spread the conflict to other parts of the city except very occasionally moreover it is clear that for many it is not a question of attacking the state and the police forces in general since police officers are circulating around tahrir square and collaborating with the protesters security service on december 1st soldiers and demonstrators cleaned up al rasheed street together in the capital the police strategy seems to be in fact above all defensive defending the green zone and the strategic routes leading to it this can be explained particularly by the weakness of the anti riot forces which probably do not have the means to recapture tahrir square such a recapture would require the army or the pmu and would provoke a bloodbath with uncertain political consequences in provincial towns this ritualized aspect of violence seems much less present and material destruction is commonplace late november after renewed clashes it seems that the rioters actions were more criticized by some of the demonstrators backed by the media and who inverted the reality by evoking an intrinsically peaceful movement in which outside elements came to advocate violence and sow chaos we even saw demonstrators interfering between the police and rioters to hinder the latter s action blocking the economy from the outset of the movement protesters have targeted economic infrastructure oil fields refineries roads bridges border crossings harbors airports which they consider to be of strategic interest a few dozen or several hundred of them set up roadblocks on the way leading to these sites and above all they burn tires to prevent the passage of trucks and employees there is of course no national strategy that have been developed and the roadblocks are over the weeks erected and then removed over and over again depending on the protesters mobilization the repression they suffer or local negotiations that take place between the authorities tribal sheikhs and potential representatives of the demonstrators for example a tribal chief may be promised to recruit about ten people against unblocking a site the most emblematic case is that of the port of umm qasr near basra whose accesses are very regularly blocked the country s administrative services are also the target of numerous blockades and sit ins that paralyze their functioning strike actions seem to concern intermittently only the public sector the private sector is as we have seen relatively underdeveloped the most strategic sector is the oil sector and as a result it s very likely that workers are treated a little better there than elsewhere since oil extraction and export is almost the country s only source of income the government s priority is to ensure its continuation hence the adequate security deployments it works since despite two months of mobilization the level of oil exports has not been affected by the events at most there have been reported some disruptions in the flow of crude from some oil fields to umm qasr or a slowdown in activity at refineries sometimes leading to local fuel shortages but these impacts are relatively marginal while it is surprising that this sector is not one way or another at the heart of the protests the situation is still likely to change however blocking the port of umm qasr the main entry point for imports would cost the iraqi economy several billion dollars dozens of ships were unable to unload their cargo this is a real problem for the entry of food products cereals oil sugar etc on which iraq is highly dependent the price of certain foodstuffs especially vegetables has risen sharply in the capital finally it should be noted that the economic activity of businesses especially the smallest is also disrupted by frequent internet blackout against iran we have already mentioned in the first part the anti iranian sovereignist and nationalist aspects of the 2018 demonstrations they are very noticeable also in 2019 in the cities of southern iraq demonstrators frequently target the various iranian consulates in the region and some of their personnel was evacuated early october the consulate in kerbala for example was stormed several times and protesters regularly try to raise there the iraqi flag in the streets they attack portraits of grand ayatollah khomeini or general qassem soleimani in najaf they rename khomeini street the october revolution street statements by the iranian supreme guide ali khamenei who describes the demonstrations as the result of an american zionist plot contribute to exacerbating the wrath of iraqis this focus on iranian control over the country associated with political corruption remains very present and even peaked at the end of november when the demonstrations were severely repressed in iran the consulate of the holy city of najaf was thus burned down twice by rioters 4 from the green zone from october 25th onwards the situation is so confused that the political forces representing the iraqi bourgeoisie hesitate about the measures to be implemented to put an end to the protest the security forces are mobilized everywhere but the government seems to favor above all the use of police units especially riot police which are considered to be more reliable and in which many former militiamen of the pmu have been recruited in recent years in some cases the army is deployed as reinforcement including very loyal units such as the counter terrorism service which proved to be unsuited but each time it means taking the risk of seeing these units perpetrate a massacre or on the contrary showing little spirit of fight on november 5th rioters captured an armored vehicle at umm qasr in kerbala on two occasions unarmed men in uniform could be seen displaying their support for the demonstrators or marching side by side with them the government is aware that some units may not be obeying orders of very strong repression on the security front it should be added that during this period the internet access was repeatedly shutdown because according to the prime minister it was being used to spread violence and hatred these interruptions lasting a few hours or a few days are sometimes limited to social networks and messaging applications only although they are based on a less powerful technology than that used in iran at the same time since vpn applications are able to bypass them the state s response must also be political in order to separate the more moderate protesters from the more radical but the politicians are divided and the first announcements of a cabinet reshuffle leave the protesters completely cold on october 26th sadrist deputies and those of the fatah alliance the political wing of the pmu withdrew their support for the government and demanded early parliamentary elections and one wonders who could benefit from them and a change in the electoral law and the constitution the intervention of iranian general qassem soleimani who then travelled to the iraqi capital was necessary for the fatah alliance to restore its support to the prime minister twenty four hours later for his part iraqi president barham saleh promised a new electoral law and early elections which the prime minister hastened to consider unfeasible moreover there s no guarantee that the announcement of such an election would be enough to demobilize the population as in france in june 1968 while a parliamentary committee began to draft amendments to the constitution bargaining and negotiations were well underway and on november 9th we learned that the country s main political forces had just reached an agreement to keep prime minister adel abdul mahdi in office and to put an end to the protest by all means however a program of reforms in particular anti corruption as well as constitutional amendments is implemented to satisfy the population this is also the work of general soleimani who has even got from muqtada al sadr to stop calling for new elections an idea that is now supported only by the united states the announcement of this agreement whereas the protest movement seems to have come to a standstill is not enough to break the deadlock 5 on the threat of civil war despite the victory over the islamic state the security situation in iraq is far from ideal the last supporters of the caliphate seem to be more active perhaps because of the events in syria and the death of abu bakr al baghdadi and to this we must add the actions of other small sunni islamic guerrilla groups all of them benefit from the mobilization of security forces against the demonstrators not a week goes by without a military patrol being ambushed or mortar shells raining down on an airport an army base or even the green zone there are also activists executed kidnapped or disappeared and it is questionable whether it s not the work of spooks or militiamen in basra for example on october 3rd masked men shot dead a well known activist and his wife at their home on october 5th armed and masked men attacked the premises of several television stations in the capital beating up employees and ransacking the scene on november 1st in nasiriya a pmu commander was assassinated on november 15th explosions wounded and killed several demonstrators in nasiriya and baghdad etc as for the unidentified snipers shooting at both peaceful demonstrators and police officers they are undoubtedly essentially an urban legend the situation is confused but in fact none of the local political forces have an interest in the outbreak of a civil war everyone knows that it can also be unintentionally sparked off all local stakeholders as well as iran have so far been pressing for the situation not to degenerate and that s why the pmu militiamen have been in second line since the beginning of the events during the first two months of mobilization armed incidents directly linked to the protest were therefore extremely rare and with little impact at the end of november in parallel to the resurgence of violence among both rioters and police officers there were signs of an increase in tension at the security level in the tribes and the pmu which did not augur well as described below the movement seems to have become bogged down and there seems to be no way out and even if local activists describe the mobilization as always constant this is at least doubtful on the other hand the number of people killed is certainly increasing in this context it would not be surprising if the most determined protesters were planning to go further in their fight against the police forces we have seen in france by dint of riots yellow vests expressing their desire to come back next time with a gun but in iraq the proximity with weapons is quite different from that in france also at the end of november it seems that demonstrators used explosive devices and there are rumors about gunshots being fired against security forces 6 stagnation or recourse to violence november 1st november 29th friday november 1st symbolically concluded the week that saw the protest movement taking on a new face with the trade unions middle classes and students entering the scene after the prayer tens of thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of baghdadis flocked to tahrir square probably the largest demonstration in iraq s history since 2003 in the evening violent fighting takes place with the police on tahrir square itself the situation stabilized and the clashes on the al jumariyah bridge decreased in intensity they were concentrated henceforth on the three bridges further north on monday 4th in baghdad and salhiya demonstrators tried to approach the radio and television buildings but they were repelled there are more new deads in the capital at the end of the week the government realizing the deadlock situation but also the growing participation in the movement of a middle class a priori unfamiliar with physical confrontation once again relies on a strong enforcement presence in the evening of thursday 7th the protesters camps are attacked in basra and kerbala and in many cities the police is on the offensive there were many casualties and a large number of arrests there are henceforth 300 dead and more than 15 000 wounded as the port of umm qasr resumed operations teachers unions were calling to return to work and on saturday the main political forces announced that they have agreed to keep the prime minister in office everyone believed that this is a turning point and that the weekend could cripple the movement on sunday 10th the week began with demonstrations in several cities but in the capital the mobilization was much smaller than it used to be the clashes now were concentrated on al khalani square that the security forces were trying to seize this is a strategic point controlling access to bridges in the area in the evening in tahrir square as fighting raged nearby demonstrators released white balloons in the sky as a sign of peace in the following days renewed calls to strike by teachers and students allowed the ranks of protesters to grow while a christmas tree decorated with iraqi flags was erected on tahrir square near basra for the umpteenth time residents blocked the accesses to the port of umm qasr to several oil fields industrial sites and the city s international airport the clashes around al khalani square were still particularly violent and several demonstrators have died there after several nights of fighting the rioters dismantled the imposing concrete barriers installed by the police regained control of the square and part of the al sinak bridge and seized an imposing multi storey car park overlooking the entrance to the bridge which they converted into an observation post and dormitory the fourth consecutive week of mobilization began on november 17th with numerous calls for a day of general strike by the sadrist movement and several trade union organizations including perhaps for the first time a union of oil workers the call for a strike however has a real effect only on the public sector the day began as usual with various roadblocks and it was marked in baghdad by clashes around the al ahrar bridge paradoxically the strategic port of umm qasr resumed its activities only to be blocked again the next day nevertheless in the following days the mobilization declined and the ministry of the interior could even on tuesday announce the end of the high alert many henceforth believe that the restoration of calm is possible and on november 20th important tribal chiefs from the south of the country were welcomed by the prime minister in order to discuss the demands of the demonstrators in the evening the occupants of the tahrir square were dancing and playing music but the battle for control of the bridges was still raging and the toll of that night of clashes got heavier than usually four rioters were killed and dozens more wounded at this stage there have been about 330 dead and 15 000 wounded across the country since the start of the movement the following day eight more demonstrators were killed in baghdad and clashes broke out in kerbala fighting also took place around the port of umm qasr but protesters who had been occupying the accesses since monday were driven out on tahrir square the sheikhs welcomed the day before were booed and during the night it is the tribal affairs office in nasiriya that was set on fire by rioters fighting resumed with greater force around the bridges of baghdad causing about ten more deaths but from then on new hotbeds of riotous violence appeared kerbala but above all najaf and nasiriya for several days demonstrators have been blocking the main bridges of the latter which is the fourth largest city in the country and capital of the province of dhi qar the poorest in iraq the last week of november began with roadblocks and demonstrations throughout the country but clashes were much more intense than in the previous days 13 rioters killed on sunday as the days passed the level of violence increased and the death toll as well in baghdad the situation around the bridges remained tense on the 25th an explosive device was thrown at the police injuring about ten of them two days later in basra another explosive device was aimed at a police officer still in basra although the demonstrators were still mobilized they removed the roadblocks after negotiations with the authorities the rest of southern iraq is in flames riots in samawa police headquarters attacked in babylon a bank burned down in kerbala etc in the holy city of najaf while shooting at the police was pointed out the premises of an islamist party was torched by demonstrators and then on the 27th it was the turn of no less than the iranian consulate to be engulfed in flames but it is in nasiriya that the fighting seemed the fiercest where rioters set fire to the governorate building and the home of a member of parliament which resulted in a high death toll the internet has been shut down in the city on the 28th security forces which received military reinforcements from baghdad try to clear the bridges over the euphrates causing a new massacre in retaliation a building of the security forces was set on fire and that of the military command of the province was besieged the death toll was 46 33 in nasiriya 11 in najaf and 2 in baghdad one of the deadliest days since the start of the movement in the evening tribal fighters armed with kalashnikovs blocked some accesses to the city in order to prevent the arrival of new police units instead in najaf pmu militiamen arrived as a backup force equipped with armored vehicles in order to protect religious sanctuaries the following days despite the curfew the funeral processions gathered thousands of inhabitants the situation is explosive and the prime minister announced his resignation tristan leoni december 3rd 2019 source in french english translation friends of the class war
the ugly reality is that most poor people in most poor countries most of the time never receive or even make contact with aid in any tangible shape or form whether it is present or absent increased or decreased are thus issues that are simply irrelevant to the ways in which they conduct their daily lives graham hancock lords of poverty the past as a guide in utilizing loans aklog birara dr december 30 2019 part ii of v in part i i expressed my personal appreciation and commended prime minister dr abiy ahmed for his nobel prize win this win is part of a larger and more complex set of issues in a valuable commentary abiy ahmed vladimir lenin and the quest for peace released on december 29 2019 the wall street journal pinpointed the formidable and interactable challenges prime minister dr abiy ahmed faces in his homeland abiy won the nobel for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighboring eritrea but his most important work lies ahead of him ethnic conflict is the principal threat to the stability of ethiopia africa s second most populous country one of the world s fastest growing economies and a critical u s counterterrorism partner for decades now i have been arguing that ethiopia s ethnic federal system imposed on the ethiopian people by the tplf dominated regime puts the country in a permanent cycle of conflict and suspense as the journal notes aptly and the country s constitution exacerbates the problem to stave off disaster mr abiy must reverse decades of ethnic exclusion reinforce pan ethiopian identity and reform a flawed federal system he must also banish the ghost of vladimir lenin ethiopia is neither federal nor democratic the 1995 constitution has reinforced differences among ethiopia s 85 plus ethnic groups by dividing the country into nine ethnically defined regional states now that mr abiy has called for elections and lifted restrictions on freedom of expression ethnonationalists among the regionally dominant groups are feeling emboldened some are violent minorities in the nine ethnic states have good reason to fear the tyranny of the majority nearly three million ethiopians fled their homes in 2018 that s more than were internally displaced due to conflict in syria somalia and nigeria combined last year as the norwegian political scientist lovise aalen put it succinctly ethnic federalism is a very problematic model for any multiethnic society among other things it does not empower citizens at all it divides and marginalizes them instead the federal structure empowers regionally dominant groups like the oromo 34 of ethiopia s population and the amhara 27 giving them little reason to compromise with ethnic minorities or migrants who ve left their home region even within ethnic based regional states power and resources grab has begun to escalate identity based conflicts have mushroomed everywhere thereby creating chaos and disorder throughout the country unable to preserve peace and security federal authorities are in firefighting mode quelling one unrest in one location while another ethnic and or religious conflict erupts somewhere else i agree with professor asnake kefale of addis ababa university who says rightly that unlike any other constitution ethiopia s allows self determination up to secession i had opined several times that ethiopia s constitution won t hold the country together and had warned against the potential danger of balkanization in the same manner as that of former yugoslavia the tplf and its allies the olf and eplf made a deliberate and strategic decision to establish ethnic federalism the intent was to leverage tplf s minority stratus and to exercise political and economic hegemony by all accounts this plot worked the impact of the apartheid like ethnic federal system on the ground continues to be horrific ethnic cleansing whole sale massacres of amhara annuak indigenous people in the omo valley and others displacements of millions of people from their homes and properties denigration and forcible evictions based on ethnic and religious affiliation hatred and use of inflammatory language revenge and retaliation and the propagation of false and misleading narratives to shape the future etc etc have been normalized however this tplf led minority ethnic based hegemony is no longer the case the political and organizational structures that the tplf created are nevertheless relatively intact newly emerging political and economic aspirants and elites are fighting among themselves for influence and control this is compounded by external pressure most prominently from egypt ethiopian ethnic federalism presents a historical puzzle why would an ethnically diverse country adopt such a constitution especially a few years after the soviet union and yugoslavia fell apart asks the journal it is painful for those of us who believe in ethiopia s long and distinguished past and promising future to understand why the tplf olf and eplf adopted a constitution that allows secession for a country that served as a beacon of independence for all non white peoples part of abiy s challenge is to undo this harm as an african proverb puts it it takes a village to raise a child it takes all of us to navigate ethiopia s dangerous political landmines and save it from collapse as critical i find it unfathomable that almost 30 years after the ethnic based system proved harmful and divisive those who lost power and others aspiring it continue to drum up support for its continuity it seems that political elites have learned almost nothing from the past its is against this unsettled and uncertain political picture that foreign aid including substantial loans must be assessed for ethiopia to optimize the full benefits of aid first and foremost it must have peace and consensus on the country s future all its citizens must enjoy personal security they must enjoy freedom to live work move own personal property and establish enterprise in any part of the country part ii of these five parts series deals with what i call peace dividends in the light of ethiopia s contentious loans and credits history over the past 28 years i shall diagnose the potential benefits and risks of substantial loans in the amount of 9 billion that prime minister dr abiy s government announced the prime minister was recognized for his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation and in particular for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighboring eritrea peaceful coexistence with neighbors has developmental values and impact i opine here that abiy s achievement is widely recognized by the global community including multilateral donors this is the reason i called the loans peace dividends peace is a multifaceted and essential ingredient in advancing sustainable and equitable development this leads me to the equally important and dire socioeconomic condition of ethiopia s 115 million people whose future prosperity depends on their freedom and empowerment increase in domestic product alone does not portray welfare and wellbeing what matters most is the capacity of individuals and families to meet basic needs on a sustainable manner and to improve their condition year after year in this connection most educated ethiopians and especially elites and so called foreign experts seem to have forgotten ethiopia s dark and debilitating times under the tigray people s liberation front tplf and its ethnic coalition the ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front eprdf that governed ethiopia for 27 years despite harsh realities on the ground ethiopia was identified as one of the fastest growing economies in the world at the same time ethiopians were treated brutally and harshly tens of millions of ethiopian youth remained unemployed and underemployed an untold number of ethiopians especially youth perished hundreds of thousands left ethiopia in search of opportunities abroad dozens were hacked to death in libya and large numbers died on the way to the middle east and in the brutal sahara desert on their way to europe one can t forget the one hundred thousand plus ethiopians who were expelled from saudi arabia an estimated 750 000 migrant workers live in saudi arabia tens of thousands are stranded in war torn yemen they left because of a desire to improve their lives beware of ethiopia s mafia like network of thieves against these cruel and punishing conditions that lasted for almost three decades the tplf dominated regime received and squandered massive amounts of loans and grants party state and government operated in tandem and created a mafia like network that plundered ethiopian society the corrosive and demoralizing effects of institutionalized plunder are still being felt today abiy s government is therefore not the first one that received massive loans by comparison it is small the question in my mind is can abiy s government do better the measurement i want to use is the extent to which ethiopia s current government plans to deploy loans grants remittances and foreign direct investments fdi so that ethiopia generates millions of jobs for its youth and for females empowers and unleashes its domestic private sector with a deliberate vision and plan to make it globally competitive accelerates the modernization of the agricultural and pastoral sectors reduces unnecessary imports through import substitution schemes criminalizes all forms of bribery commissions waste corruption and illicit outflow of capital identifies all forms of borrowing and renegotiates its massive debts or seeks debt forgiveness and demands that the stolen billions of dollars in foreign destinations are remitted back to ethiopian society as soon as possible i remind the reader to note that the largesse extended to the tplf dominated regime was squandered stolen and tens of billions of dollars were taken out of the country ethiopians were left with massive debt this is why the imf the world bank the governments of saudi arabia kuwait and others extended loans to ethiopia loans are not free goods by definition loans are repayable at one point and in one form or another i have doubts about optimal use this is because the current loans are given against a background of institutionalized and normalized party government state and private individual theft robbery corruption and massive illicit outflow of precious capital የቀን ጅቦች ተብሎ የሚጠራው what institutional mechanisms are in place to mitigate risk how was theft graft and corruption possible for one there was ample capital to steal and to hide by the time the reform process began two years ago this organized theft left millions destitute ethiopia s middle class was crushed by rising costs that went up by 20 percent last year alone ethiopia s national treasury was left virtually empty second there was no oversight ironically the 1990s and the early decade and half of the 21st century ethiopia received tens of billions of dollars in bilateral and multilateral aid including grants the united states alone granted ethiopia between 20 and 30 billion a major american newspaper reported at one point that almost all of it was siphoned off by party state and government thieves imagine how many factories the stolen billions would have built imagine how may jobs these factories would have created why import substitute matters imagine that these monies could have enabled ethiopia to establish factories that would produce and sell edible oil to ethiopian consumers instead ethiopia spends at least 600 million per year for edible oil alone a further 700 million per year is spent to import wheat there is no accurate data that can tell us the true picture and guide policy there is some good news i am delighted to hear and learn that sheikh al amoudi is establishing a factory that will produce and sell edible oil i do hope and pray that this is a trend in import substitution that ethiopia needs urgently i underscore the dual benefits of generating employment and providing consumables to ethiopians how to lie with statistics on december 17 2019 reuters did an outstanding piece under the title ethiopia s surveillance network crumbles meaning less fear and less control it quotes getachew reda former minister of information who admitted thus we lied left and right and gave false and fake statistical data on practically everything including production rates to his credit he acknowledged the damage that is why people got angry and revolted against the regime and overthrew it the question many ethiopians are asking is this is the replacement better have officials ceased lying with data remember that the one to five surveillance network that is disintegrating faster than its creators thought possible had exaggerated growth rates and the welfare of the population had propagated the notion of transparency and accountability in a country where these principles were non existent etc the regime denied theft graft corruption and illicit outflow with vigor and success donors never questioned this phenomenon has the narrative changed at one point the world bank had questioned the government of ethiopia in general and the national bank in particular why they were underreporting remittances the reason is simple the regime wanted to receive more foreign exchange and under reporting remittances was part of fake statistics independent institutional oversight is imperative the governing party the state and government borrowed foreign exchange and spent it at will without any institutional mechanism to check and to assess benefits and risks financial and monetary data was underreported it was made opaque intentionally massive theft graft and waste is real it is morally and ethically corrosive and destabilizing the greatest damage is borne by the poorest of the poor and by the middle class as the captioned quote illustrates the poor are never in the loop when it comes to aid the irony is that aid is given to alleviate poverty how do you alleviate poverty without engaging the poor how do you justify aid year after year for more than 50 years without creating resiliency evidence shows that despite waste and theft ethiopia became one of the largest recipients of foreign aid under the tplf regime in theory at least this massive inflow of capital should have induced substantial employment and increased productivity and should have created a large middle class ethiopia should have achieved food self sufficiency ethiopia produces sesame but imports edible oil massive foreign exchange inflow including remittances created a handful of millionaires and possible paper billionaires in one of the poorest starved and unhealthiest countries on the planet the rich build lavish homes construct formidable fences using imported iron bars to protect themselves against the very people who made them rich and live in constant fear for their own personal safety and for the safety of their families i had seen identical enclaves in brazil and venezuela the few with financial means remit and hide their financial assets overseas for a number of reasons to protect their wealth assets from prying journalists civil society and public officials to avoid taxation to finance and support their children s education in foreign places and to ensure their long term security to invest in reliable and secure properties such as houses apartments condos groceries eating places and the like to avail themselves of liquidity in the event of sickness and change in government do ethiopia s rich have social responsibility yes they do i remember once on a mission to indonesia talking with a colleague there what corrupt indonesian officials and private persons do with their riches he asked me do you see that bridge over there i said of course the man who built it is a crook but a good crook he posed another question do you know who owns the factory that produces the beautiful silk dresses and batiks that you and other foreign visitors buy here the factory and numerous others like it employ hundreds of thousands of indonesians most of them females the public knows that indonesia is a corrupt country but those who are corrupt have a redeeming quality they invest their wealth produce goods and provide employment his depiction left me speechless the contrast between indonesia and most of sub saharan africa is huge the lesson i gained is this if you steal and or if you are corrupt at least invest your riches in productive enterprises within your own country after all the money you stole belongs to the society you robbed this is hardly the case in ethiopia or in the rest of africa i leave you to ponder the following questions what did the rich and super rich produce what is the source of their wealth did they build factories that employ thousands of youth including females which of ethiopia s consumer goods did they produce for the domestic market what structural transformation did they bring did the well to do dig wells or construct water kiosks similar to what rich kenyans did in their villages did the rich and superrich build schools in their home towns so that deserving children would attend schools close to their homes did the well to do instead send their children overseas to acquire their education so that they could be ahead of their peers and govern the poor did they promote the right moral ethical values and standards what proportion of their wealth did they contribute for charitable purposes does pumping more loans into the ethiopian economy without a clear vision of where the money is invested and for what make sense part iii of v the benefits and risks of ethiopia s massive loans the past as a guide in utilizing loans will be posted next week 12 30 2019 join the conversation like borkena on facebook and get ethiopian news updates

president trump year 3 december 31 2019 1 the conclusion of the mueller witch hunt unsubstantiated accusations by the left fake media of obstruction of justice explicitly not found in mueller s report 2 accusations of committing quid pro quo bribery with president zelensky of ukraine as the media ignores hides joe biden s clear expression of quid pro quo toward ukrainian officials 3 the democrats launch of the impeachment hearings against the president house democrats impeaching president trump with no regard for due process or factual basis to the ukraine phone call 4 and now nancy pelosi s refusal to even send the articles of impeachment to the senate guilty of obstructing congress herself by stone washington president donald j trump remarks at the 74th session of the united nations general assembly with the year 2019 coming to a close it is important to reflect upon the many blessings that have been bestowed upon our great country when examining the many accomplishments of the trump presidency in 2019 no other administration has achieved such astoundingly rapid success in u s history in continuing my tradition of covering the many ground breaking achievements by president trump throughout the year i will provide a detailed timeline archiving the most prominent successes of 2019 following last year 2018 and his first year 2017 president trump s third year in office has been monumentally fulfilling despite facing the strongest levels of opposition and harassment from house democrats over temporarily withholding foreign aid to ukraine surviving the most unorthodox and unwarranted impeachment process as a result and constantly defending himself from a torrent of hostile fake news stories from cnn abc msnbc ny times washington post and other mainstream press in his third year alone the american economy has broken through record after record as the dow gains its 10 000th point and other stocks surge to record highs amid remarkable levels of consumer spending steady rise of median household income and the lowest recorded unemployment ever with the assistance of senate republicans president trump has appointed a record number of federal judges to various federal circuit and district courts across the country nearly 200 unseen since the first administration of george washington where everything had to be started from nothing under trump and the joint chiefs of staff u s special forces have raided and destroyed the remnants of isis in northern syria killing isis leader al baghdadi and his successor in the process trump pulled all of our troops out of that 18 year quagmire war in afghanistan and trump also became the first sitting president to cross over the south korean north korean demilitarized zone without former notice or hesitation n b trump kept his campaign promise not to go to war and to pull u s out of all the rothschild illuminati false flag wars that obama bush 43 clinton and bush 41 got u s into he did that in syria afghanistan and in north korea despite the neocons and democrat socialist party trying to push trump into perpetual war with false flag chemical attacks on civilians in syrian and afghanistan and false rocket launches by the cia or china trying to frame n korea s kim jong un but these and so many other significant accomplishments by president trump often go uncovered by the mainstream media who deliberately hype up the failed mueller investigation hysteria surrounding the ukrainian phone call and now the delayed impeachment by house democrats obsessed with removing trump from office which nancy pelosi is afraid to send to the senate knowing she and her democrat allies have perpetrated a fraud up president trump and upon the american people the timeline provided below supersedes the agitprop disinformation that has become commonplace for mainstream news media and does justice in honoring many of the phenomenal achievements of the trump presidency this past year in lockstep with the president s call to defend the southern border from a rising flow of illegal crossings the pentagon ordered thousands of additional u s troops to safeguard the border 250 of which would defend the texas border from an incoming caravan of illegals from central america this would later inspire the mexican government to personally crack down on their own citizens in sending troops to prevent illegal crossings and in a valiant bid to ensure that congress provides 5 7 billion in funding for a u s mexico border wall president trump presided over the longest government shutdown in history lasting from december 22 2018 until january 25 2019 just before the new year the 2018 4th quarter jobs report revealed that wages rose more than 3 marking the first time in 10 years this has occurred during his third state of the union address which many call his greatest president trump vowed to push for a ban to late term abortions asserting that many states like new york have laws that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother s womb moments before birth after january it was reported that the many americans who were formerly left out of the economy flooded back to the job market as labor participation reached its highest level in 6 years on february 4th the united states pressured 8 other european countries into formerly recognizing the democratically elected juan guaido as the legitimate president of venezuela under the trump tax cut small businesses are now able to deduct 20 of their business income as exempt from tax it was also reported that small business hiring reached an all time high in february the trump administration called upon congress to stand behind the united states reciprocal trade act which allows for the u s to impose tariffs on nations like china and canada that bear a long track record of unfair cheating in trade this year president trump secured a record 716 billion in military spending to better support america s troops in addition to domestic military spending trump also secured an added 100 billion in defense spending from nato allies in mid february hud secretary ben carson oversaw the creation of 8 764 opportunity zones seeking to promote new job opportunities in low income communities president trump hosted the second u s north korean summit with chairman kim jung un from february 27 28 2019 in hanoi vietnam the summit sought to develop and further steps for denuclearization by the north koreans in exchange for sanction relief from the u s multiple u s farmers and agricultural organizations placed their unwavering support behind the united states mexico canada agreement usmca president trump slapped members of nicholas maduro s socialist regime with economic sanctions while revoking 77 visas of individuals connected to maduro as punishment for their role in blocking humanitarian aid to venezuela while increasing pressure on the regime the trump administration passed an executive order to eliminate veteran student loan debt and took preventative action against the rising rate of veteran suicide the u s unemployment rate remained at or below 4 for an entire year far surpassing the obama administration s struggle to keep the rate at 3 for at least a year because of this labor participation attained a 5 year high as there were 1 million more jobs available than unemployed people a continued reflection of the administration s pro worker policies on march 25th the united states finally recognized israel s ownership and sovereignty over the golan heights in the levant a historic show of solidarity with israel the u s also imposed sanctions on 9 individuals and 14 entities from iran holding the hostile regime accountable for its destabilizing erratic and anti american

tokyo the world has lost a great warrior for price stability paul volcker led a determined campaign to restrain double digit inflation as the us federal reserve s fed chair in the 1980s and exerted a powerful influence over us economic policy for decades to follow just a couple of years ago when he was nearly 90 he grilled me on the inflationary potential of abenomics japanese prime minister shinzo abe s economic reform strategy i was an adviser on formulating the strategy but despite volcker s praiseworthy achievements it is worth considering the relevance of his approach in today s low inflation environment in 1936 when john maynard keynes published the general theory of employment interest and money global price movements were sluggish assuming that below zero inflation would remain relatively rigid and basing inflation expectations on past outcomes keynes prescribed large scale fiscal expenditure this helped countries to escape from the deflation of the great depression but after world war ii erupted in 1939 inflation surged in many countries including greece hungary and the philippines in the united states inflation reached double digit rates in 1942 and 1947 when volcker became fed chair in august 1979 us inflation was again at double digit levels 11 35 per cent and rising to rein it in and stabilise the wider global economy the fed hiked interest rates despite the backlash from some us industries when he left his post in 1987 the inflation rate was below 4 per cent its peak since then 5 4 per cent in 1990 during the same period robert lucas who went on to win the economics nobel in 1995 managed to convince a large share of academic economists that they had been formulating expectations wrong according to his rational expectations model an economic agent s predictions about the future not knowledge of history makes all the difference according to this approach monetary policy especially predictable monetary policy has little power to change capacity utilisation or resource allocation with that the counter keynesian macroeconomic revolution appeared to have succeeded during the great moderation which began in the mid 1980s business cycle fluctuations in developed countries became significantly less volatile and resource allocation was guided by the price mechanism but the great moderation ended abruptly in 2008 when the subprime mortgage crisis in the us quickly fuelled a global financial and economic crisis which in turn triggered a severe eurozone debt crisis a keynesianism resurgence soon followed with many of the world s most influential economies embracing stimulus measures whether fiscal as in china or more commonly monetary as in europe japan the united kingdom and the us while all of the world s major advanced economy central banks rapidly expanded their balance sheets japan initially lagged behind the others after all its mortgage market was not under the same kind of stress as those in the us and the eurozone but this imbalance put local industry at a competitive disadvantage as the yen appreciated against other major currencies abenomics launched in 2013 helped to correct this imbalance with the bank of japan s accelerating balance sheet expansion weakening the exchange rate and easing the pressure on japanese industry since 2008 global inflation and expectations for future prices have broken with the pattern established in the early 1980s while central banks have continued to pursue 2 per cent inflation the eurozone and japan in particular have struggled to reach that target the us has managed to eke annual inflation of just over 2 per cent since 2017 unlike during volcker s era prices compounded the inflationary inertia as price formation became a strategic decision amid excess demand as the ceo of a japanese owned international fast food chain recently told me he decided not to raise prices after a 2 per cent consumption tax hike came into effect last october because he assumed that his competitors would do the same why the mechanism of business cycles has changed so profoundly or whether it is merely our interpretation of events that has changed are difficult questions but there is a concept that can help us answer them the theory of rational or behavioural inattention as the nobel laureate economist christopher a sims observed in 2003 in the past it was assumed that economic agents are not only rational but also computationally unconstrained but the truth is that people have limited information processing capacity so as the german phenomenologist edmund husserl noted our brains select information to set aside unprocessed our behaviour rational or not is shaped not by all available information but only by the information to which we pay attention during volcker s fed tenure people were acutely aware of the costs of double digit inflation so they would notice and respond even overreact to any development that seemed remotely likely to spur inflation as today s economic actors set their expectations they may well be paying attention to very different kinds of developments given the powerful role of expectations in determining economic outcomes this could be enough to alter the functioning of the business cycle economists such as paul krugman and kiminori matsuyama argue that there are two types of macroeconomic equilibria one where information is anchored to history and another where it is anchored to rational expectations about the future understanding how economic actors determine which information to process or neglect could go a long way towards revealing the relative importance of history and expectations in determining equilibria thereby helping policymakers to avoid costly imbalances volcker would surely

renowned economist shen jianguang shares his predictions for the chinese economy in 2019 a new year is a time for fresh starts and new beginnings at least that is what policymakers in beijing will be hoping the second half of 2018 produced an avalanche of negative headlines on the economy as a domestic deleveraging drive and the intensifying trade war with the united states slowed growth and undermined confidence will these headwinds continue battering the chinese economy this year or will beijing be able to engineer a recovery there are few people better placed to answer this question than shen jianguang currently chief economist at jd digits the leading data and technology firm spun off from e commerce giant jd com shen is one of china s most respected economic analysts his career has included stints at the european central bank international monetary fund and oecd as well as china international capital corporation and mizuho securities in this interview shen explains that analysts are right to be concerned about the health of china s economy but that many are not paying attention to the greatest risk of all how would you describe the overall state of the economy in early 2019 i think the chinese economy is facing serious challenges in 2018 there was an external shock which was the china united states trade war domestically the deleveraging policy resulted in overtightening in the financial system on top of that there was also a severe antipollution campaign which has created challenges for many small and medium sized companies which of these factors has had the greatest impact on the economy the trade war or the domestic policies primarily it has been the domestic factors that have weighed on the economy despite the trade war if you look at the hard data chinese exports to the united states have increased faster in 2018 than in the previous year so the impact of the trade war has been more psychological than anything else of course 2019 will probably be more challenging than 2018 because a lot of companies have been afraid of the impact of the trade war and have tried to avoid the 25 tariffs and have been frontloading their products for the us market this will have an impact on firms in 2019 even if the 25 tariffs do not go ahead on the other hand domestic factors such as the deleveraging and the shutdown of polluting companies have had a much larger impact on business sentiment and the overall economy profit levels in the private sector have dropped significantly and confidence weakened in the third quarter i am working for jd digits which is associated with the e commerce firm jd com so i see a lot of big data on consumption looking at this data it is clear that consumption has weakened since the third quarter if the us were to raise tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 as it has threatened to do what impact would that have on the economy i think the impact would be profoundly serious and i suspect that is the reason behind the change in beijing s stance toward trying to reach an agreement with the us i did a study on how the performance of chinese exporters had been affected by the 25 us tariffs on 50 billion of goods and i saw a sharp decline in the growth rate of their business with the us i think that is the reason why the chinese government has tried everything to avoid that happening but i think the trump administration also understands that these tariffs will also have a significant impact on us consumers in some sectors that would be affected such as furniture china accounts for around 50 of us imports as you mentioned possibly the most important factor influencing the economy in 2018 was beijing s deleveraging drive how did this policy come about and how has it impacted the economy the deleveraging drive was primarily focused on shadow banking in china shadow banking is a huge sector estimates vary but most put the size of the market at around rmb 100 trillion 14 5 trillion the bank wealth management products alone are worth around rmb 30 trillion the deleveraging drive led to a sharp contraction in the shadow banking sector and that dealt a serious shock to private firms especially small and medium sized businesses as they heavily relied on lending from shadow banking channels deleveraging also resulted in a sharp decline in the stock market which had a further impact on many private companies that had mortgaged their shares those companies were forced to sell their shareholdings causing a chain reaction on stock prices the main impact of the crackdown on shadow banking was felt by smes but consumers also felt the effects due to the decline in the peer to peer lending industry what role did the peer to peer p2p lending industry play in the economy consumers mainly used p2p products as a place to store their savings online p2p companies generally offered much higher interest rates than banks so consumers often put their savings there to earn more interest normally p2p companies also act as facilitators by lending to consumers but in china some p2p companies instead used the money they raised to lend to the corporate sector then when the government tightened liquidity conditions this caused a wave of bankruptcies among those p2p firms nearly 2 000 p2p companies went bankrupt or closed down a lot of consumers lost their savings and this had an impact on consumption as well that is one of the main reasons why the economy is so weak right now what will happen with regard to the deleveraging drive in 2019 i think the deleveraging campaign has already ended yi gang governor of the people s bank of china announced in october that the country s debt levels have stabilized and the chinese government has made no mention of more deleveraging in recent statements instead they have introduced cuts to banks reserve requirement ratios rrr and reduced the seven day repo rates we also know that overall interest rates have been declining so in a way monetary easing has started already the government also moved to cut personal income tax rates in october and has pledged to introduce more tax cuts in 2019 policies should be very accommodative but this is unlikely to be enough to revive growth in the short term because it will take time for these policies to work through the economy how far do you expect beijing to go in terms of introducing stimulus measures to boost growth in 2019 stimulus measures may improve things a bit but my main worry for 2019 is not deleveraging or the trade war but a liquidity trap just as happened to japan in the 1990s the bank of japan at that time had accommodative policies and even undertook some quantitative easing qe but businesses still struggled to borrow and banks were reluctant to lend so i think this could be a risk for china in 2019 beijing has introduced several measures designed to boost lending to the private sector what more does the government need to do to avoid a liquidity trap i think the impact of the current policies will be limited the key is not monetary policy but furthering structural reform for example whether the government can really ensure equal treatment for state owned enterprises soes and private companies the banks are always willing to lend to soes so rather than just urge banks to lend more to the private sector the government should treat soes and private firms equally this is what pboc government yi gang meant when referring to competitive neutrality the us has also been pushing china to introduce structural reforms removing special treatment for soes how far will beijing be willing to go in this regard the chinese leader recently gave a speech at an event celebrating the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening up era judging from that speech i am more optimistic regarding the opening up side than the reform side the government already expressed willingness to open the financial sector more to foreign institutions regarding reforms such as soe and land reforms i saw few signs from that speech that large moves in these areas are imminent there have been quite a lot of negative news stories about china s economy in recent months are there any positive trends that are going underreported first of all i expect that the growth rate will slow down in 2019 but i believe that even a 6 growth rate is good enough even if it goes down to 5 so what that would still be among the highest in the world in the world s second largest economy i think pursuing a high growth rate would be dangerous i think there are two positive signs going into 2019 the first is that the trade war with the united states will probably be resolved i believe that the negotiations will bear fruit and the two sides will reach an agreement i don t think the extra 25 tariffs will be introduced that would remove a lot of uncertainty from chinese exporters secondly the introduction of more accommodative policies will mitigate a lot of pain in the economy you mentioned that consumption slowed during the second half of 2018 what has been driving this slowdown firstly there has been a general slowdown in the economy which has resulted in a slowdown in income growth secondly there is the wealth effect the decline in stock prices and stagnation in the housing market do you expect consumption to continue to drag in 2019 i think the overall trend is downward there has been quite a fast decline in the growth rate in september the growth rate of retail sales was 9 2 but by november it had fallen to 8 1 reviving the economy will take at least six months or two quarters the government has already started this shift toward accommodative policies there has been a slowdown in property sales in many cities what developments can we expect in the real estate market in 2019 the policy appears still to be not to allow property prices to fall further i think it is also quite clear that the chinese government has concluded that there is a huge bubble in the property market that s why they have this policy of not allowing prices to decreasing any more but i think the pain in the market will continue i don t see a recovery next year it will probably remain stagnant what will be main focus for china s policymakers this year i think the number one issue will be reaching an agreement with the us regarding the trade dispute of course even though i see these negotiations ultimately being successful it will still take a lot of effort from the chinese side second will be reviving the economy through tax cuts
the benefits and risks of ethiopia s massive loans by dr aklog birara the ugly reality is that most poor people in most poor countries most of the time never receive or even make contact with aid in any tangible shaper or form whether it is present or absent increased or decreased are thus issues that are simply irrelevant to the ways in which they conduct their daily lives graham hancock lords of poverty part ii of v december 30 2019 ezega com in part i i expressed my personal appreciation and commended prime minister dr abiy ahmed for his nobel prize win this win is part of a larger and more complex set of issues in a valuable commentary abiy ahmed vladimir lenin and the quest for peace released on december 29 2019 the wall street journal pinpointed the formidable and intractable challenges prime minister dr abiy ahmed faces in his homeland abiy won the nobel for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighboring eritrea but his most important work lies ahead of him ethnic conflict is the principal threat to the stability of ethiopia africa s second most populous country one of the world s fastest growing economies and a critical u s counterterrorism partner for decades now i have been arguing that ethiopia s ethnic federal system imposed on the ethiopian people by the tplf dominated regime puts the country in a permanent cycle of conflict and suspense as the journal notes aptly and the country s constitution exacerbates the problem to stave off disaster mr abiy must reverse decades of ethnic exclusion reinforce pan ethiopian identity and reform a flawed federal system he must also banish the ghost of vladimir lenin ethiopia is neither federal nor democratic the 1995 constitution has reinforced differences among ethiopia s 85 plus ethnic groups by dividing the country into nine ethnically defined regional states now that mr abiy has called for elections and lifted restrictions on freedom of expression ethnonationalists among the regionally dominant groups are feeling emboldened some are violent minorities in the nine ethnic states have good reason to fear the tyranny of the majority nearly three million ethiopians fled their homes in 2018 that s more than were internally displaced due to conflict in syria somalia and nigeria combined last year as the norwegian political scientist lovise aalen put it succinctly ethnic federalism is a very problematic model for any multiethnic society among other things it does not empower citizens at all it divides and marginalizes them instead the federal structure empowers regionally dominant groups like the oromo 34 of ethiopia s population and the amhara 27 giving them little reason to compromise with ethnic minorities or migrants who ve left their home region even within ethnic based regional states power and resources grab has begun to escalate identity based conflicts have mushroomed everywhere thereby creating chaos and disorder throughout the country unable to preserve peace and security federal authorities are in firefighting mode quelling one unrest in one location while another ethnic and or religious conflict erupts somewhere else i agree with professor asnake kefale of addis ababa university who says rightly that unlike any other constitution ethiopia s allows self determination up to secession i had opined several times that ethiopia s constitution won t hold the country together and had warned against the potential danger of balkanization in the same manner as that of former yugoslavia the tplf and its allies the olf and eplf made a deliberate and strategic decision to establish ethnic federalism the intent was to leverage tplf s minority status and to exercise political and economic hegemony by all accounts this plot worked the impact of the apartheid like ethnic federal system on the ground continues to be horrific ethnic cleansing wholesale massacres of amhara annuak indigenous people in the omo valley and others displacements of millions of people from their homes and properties denigration and forcible evictions based on ethnic and religious affiliation hatred and use of inflammatory language revenge and retaliation and the propagation of false and misleading narratives to shape the future etc etc have been normalized however this tplf led minority ethnic based hegemony is no longer the case the political and organizational structures that the tplf created are nevertheless relatively intact newly emerging political and economic aspirants and elites are fighting among themselves for influence and control this is compounded by external pressure most prominently from egypt ethiopian ethnic federalism presents a historical puzzle why would an ethnically diverse country adopt such a constitution especially a few years after the soviet union and yugoslavia fell apart asks the journal it is painful for those of us who believe in ethiopia s long and distinguished past and promising future to understand why the tplf olf and eplf adopted a constitution that allows secession for a country that served as a beacon of independence for all non white peoples part of abiy s challenge is to undo this harm as an african proverb puts it it takes a village to raise a child it takes all of us to navigate ethiopia s dangerous political landmines and save it from collapse as critical i find it unfathomable that almost 30 years after the ethnic based system proved harmful and divisive those who lost power and others aspiring it continue to drum up support for its continuity it seems that political elites have learned almost nothing from the past it is against this unsettled and uncertain political picture that foreign aid including substantial loans must be assessed for ethiopia to optimize the full benefits of aid first and foremost it must have peace and consensus on the country s future all its citizens must enjoy personal security they must enjoy the freedom to live work move own personal property and establish enterprise in any part of the country part ii of these five parts series deals with what i call peace dividends in the light of ethiopia s contentious loans and credits history over the past 28 years i shall diagnose the potential benefits and risks of substantial loans in the amount of 9 billion that prime minister dr abiy s government announced the prime minister was recognized for his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation and in particular for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighboring eritrea peaceful coexistence with neighbors has developmental values and impact i opine here that abiy s achievement is widely recognized by the global community including multilateral donors this is the reason i called the loans peace dividends peace is a multifaceted and essential ingredient in advancing sustainable and equitable development this leads me to the equally important and dire socioeconomic condition of ethiopia s 115 million people whose future prosperity depends on their freedom and empowerment an increase in domestic products alone does not portray welfare and wellbeing what matters most is the capacity of individuals and families to meet basic needs in a sustainable manner and to improve their condition year after year in this connection most educated ethiopians and especially elites and so called foreign experts seem to have forgotten ethiopia s dark and debilitating times under the tigray people s liberation front tplf and its ethnic coalition the ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front eprdf that governed ethiopia for 27 years despite harsh realities on the ground ethiopia was identified as one of the fastest growing economies in the world at the same time ethiopians were treated brutally and harshly tens of millions of ethiopian youth remained unemployed and underemployed an untold number of ethiopians especially youth perished hundreds of thousands left ethiopia in search of opportunities abroad dozens were hacked to death in libya and large numbers died on the way to the middle east and in the brutal sahara desert on their way to europe one can t forget the one hundred thousand plus ethiopians who were expelled from saudi arabia an estimated 750 000 migrant workers live in saudi arabia tens of thousands are stranded in war torn yemen they left because of a desire to improve their lives beware of ethiopia s mafia like network of thieves against these cruel and punishing conditions that lasted for almost three decades the tplf dominated regime received and squandered massive amounts of loans and grants party state and government operated in tandem and created a mafia like network that plundered ethiopian society the corrosive and demoralizing effects of institutionalized plunder are still being felt today abiy s government is therefore not the first one that received massive loans by comparison it is small the question in my mind is can abiy s government do better the measurement i want to use is the extent to which ethiopia s current government plans to deploy loans grants remittances and foreign direct investments fdi so that ethiopia generates millions of jobs for its youth and for females empowers and unleashes its domestic private sector with a deliberate vision and plan to make it globally competitive accelerates the modernization of the agricultural and pastoral sectors reduces unnecessary imports through import substitution schemes criminalizes all forms of bribery commissions waste corruption and illicit outflow of capital identifies all forms of borrowing and renegotiates its massive debts or seeks debt forgiveness and demands that the stolen billions of dollars in foreign destinations are remitted back to ethiopian society as soon as possible i remind the reader to note that the largesse extended to the tplf dominated regime was squandered stolen and tens of billions of dollars were taken out of the country ethiopians were left with massive debt this is why the imf the world bank the governments of saudi arabia kuwait and others extended loans to ethiopia loans are not free goods by definition loans are repayable at one point and in one form or another i have doubts about optimal use this is because the current loans are given against a background of institutionalized and normalized party government state and private individual theft robbery corruption and massive illicit outflow of precious capital የቀን ጅቦች ተብሎ የሚጠራው what institutional mechanisms are in place to mitigate risk how was theft graft and corruption possible for one there was ample capital to steal and to hide by the time the reform process began two years ago this organized theft left millions destitute ethiopia s middle class was crushed by rising costs that went up by 20 percent last year alone ethiopia s national treasury was left virtually empty second there was no oversight ironically the 1990s and the early decade and half of the 21st century ethiopia received tens of billions of dollars in bilateral and multilateral aid including grants the united states alone granted ethiopia between 20 and 30 billion a major american newspaper reported at one point that almost all of it was siphoned off by party state and government thieves imagine how many factories the stolen billions would have built imagine how many jobs these factories would have created why import substitute matters imagine that these monies could have enabled ethiopia to establish factories that would produce and sell edible oil to ethiopian consumers instead ethiopia spends at least 600 million per year for edible oil alone a further 700 million per year is spent to import wheat there is no accurate data that can tell us the true picture and guide policy there is some good news i am delighted to hear and learn that sheikh al amoudi is establishing a factory that will produce and sell edible oil i do hope and pray that this is a trend in import substitution that ethiopia needs urgently i underscore the dual benefits of generating employment and providing consumables to ethiopians how to lie with statistics on december 17 2019 reuters did an outstanding piece under the title ethiopia s surveillance network crumbles meaning less fear and less control it quotes getachew reda former minister of information who admitted thus we lied left and right and gave false and fake statistical data on practically everything including production rates to his credit he acknowledged the damage that is why people got angry and revolted against the regime and overthrew it the question many ethiopians are asking is this is the replacement better have officials ceased lying with data remember that the one to five surveillance network that is disintegrating faster than its creators thought possible had exaggerated growth rates and the welfare of the population had propagated the notion of transparency and accountability in a country where these principles were non existent etc the regime denied theft graft corruption and illicit outflow with vigor and success donors never questioned this phenomenon has the narrative changed at one point the world bank had questioned the government of ethiopia in general and the national bank in particular why they were underreporting remittances the reason is simple the regime wanted to receive more foreign exchange and under reporting remittances was part of fake statistics independent institutional oversight is imperative the governing party the state and the government borrowed foreign exchange and spent it at will without any institutional mechanism to check and to assess benefits and risks financial and monetary data was underreported it was made opaque intentionally massive theft graft and waste is real it is morally and ethically corrosive and destabilizing the greatest damage is borne by the poorest of the poor and by the middle class as the captioned quote illustrates the poor are never in the loop when it comes to aid the irony is that aid is given to alleviate poverty how do you alleviate poverty without engaging the poor how do you justify aid year after year for more than 50 years without creating resiliency evidence shows that despite waste and theft ethiopia became one of the largest recipients of foreign aid under the tplf regime in theory at least this massive inflow of capital should have induced substantial employment and increased productivity and should have created a large middle class ethiopia should have achieved food self sufficiency ethiopia produces sesame but imports edible oil massive foreign exchange inflow including remittances created a handful of millionaires and possible paper billionaires in one of the poorest starved and unhealthiest countries on the planet the rich build lavish homes construct formidable fences using imported iron bars to protect themselves against the very people who made them rich and live in constant fear for their own personal safety and for the safety of their families i had seen identical enclaves in brazil and venezuela the few with financial means remit and hide their financial assets overseas for a number of reasons 1 to protect their wealth assets from prying journalists civil society and public officials 2 to avoid taxation 3 to finance and support their children s education in foreign places and to ensure their longterm security 4 to invest in reliable and secure properties such as houses apartments condos groceries eating places and the like 5 to avail themselves of liquidity in the event of sickness and change in government do ethiopia s rich have social responsibility yes they do i remember once on a mission to indonesia talking with a colleague there what corrupt indonesian officials and private persons do with their riches he asked me do you see that bridge over there i said of course the man who built it is a crook but a good crook he posed another question do you know who owns the factory that produces the beautiful silk dresses and batiks that you and other foreign visitors buy here the factory and numerous others like it employ hundreds of thousands of indonesians most of the females the public knows that indonesia is a corrupt country but those who are corrupt have a redeeming quality they invest their wealth produce goods and provide employment his depiction left me speechless the contrast between indonesia and most of sub saharan africa is huge the lesson i gained is this if you steal and or if you are corrupt at least invest your riches in productive enterprises within your own country after all the money you stole belongs to the society you robbed this is hardly the case in ethiopia or in the rest of africa i leave you to ponder the following questions what did the rich and super rich produce what is the source of their wealth did they build factories that employ thousands of youth including females which of ethiopia s consumer goods did they produce for the domestic market what structural transformation did they bring did the well to do dig wells or construct water kiosks similar to what rich kenyans did in their villages did the rich and superrich build schools in their home towns so that deserving children would attend schools close to their homes did the well to do instead send their children overseas to acquire their education so that they could be ahead of their peers and govern the poor did they promote the right moral ethical values and standards what proportion of their wealth did they contribute for charitable purposes does pumping more loans into the ethiopian economy without a clear vision of where the money is invested and for what makes sense part iii of v the benefits and risks of ethiopia s massive loans the past as a guide in utilizing loans will be posted soon disclaimer the views and opinions

as 1960 dawned sub saharan africa braced for historic change that year 17 of its countries were destined to gain independence from european colonial powers but six decades on the continent is mired in many problems it is struggling to build an economic model that encourages enduring growth addresses poverty and provides a future for its youth here are some of the key issues youth explosion africa s population grew from 227 million in 1960 to more than one billion in 2018 more than 60 per cent are aged under 25 according to the brookings institution a us think tank the most striking change for me is the increasing reality of disaffected youth a younger population that is ready to explode at any moment cameroonian sociologist francis nyamnjoh said they are hungry for political freedoms they are hungry for economic opportunities and they are hungry for social fulfilment joblessness is a major peril unemployed youths are an easy prey for armed groups particularly jihadist movements in the sahel or may be tempted to risk clandestine emigration often at the cost of their lives the continent s population is expected to double by 2050 led by nigeria ethiopia and democratic republic of congo drc poverty and inequality the proportion of africa s population living below the poverty line less than 1 90 1 7 euros per day fell from 54 7 pc in 1990 to 41 4 pc in 2015 according to the world bank but this average masks enormous differences from one country to another exemplified by gabon 3 4 pc of the population in 2017 and madagascar 77 6 pc in 2012 the inequalities between countries are as extreme as in asia and the inequalities within countries as as high as in latin america where landless peasants coexist with huge landowners said togolese economist kako nubukpo christophe cottet an economist at the french development agency afd pointed out that inequality in africa is very poorly measured there are notably no figures on inequalities of inherited wealth a key issue in africa mega cities and countryside recent decades have seen the expansion of megacities like lagos and kinshasa typically ringed by shantytowns where people live in extreme poverty although many medium sized cities have also grown more than 40 pc of africans now live in urban areas compared with 14 6 pc in 1960 according to the world bank in 1960 cairo and johannesburg were the only african cities with more than a million residents consultants mckinsey and company estimate that by 2030 about 100 cities will have a million inhabitants twice as many as in latin america but this urban growth is not necessarily the outcome of a rural exodus said cottet the population is rising across africa as a whole rather faster in towns than in rural areas said cottet there is also the problem of unemployment in towns rural people have little interest in migrating there lost decades of growth halt in the early 1980s braked by a debt crisis and structural adjustment policies it took two decades to recover per capita gdp as measured in constant us dollars shows the up and downs although these figures are official and do not cover africa s large informal economy 1 112 in 1960 1 531 in 1974 1 166 in 1994 and 1 657 in 2018 if you do an assessment over 60 years something serious happened in africa with the loss of 20 years but there is no denying that what is happening now is more positive cottet said the imf s and world bank s structural adjustment programmes broke the motors of growth said nubukpo whose book l urgence africaine the african emergency makes the case for a revamped growth model the belt tightening programmes emphasised the short term to the detriment of investments in education health and training new thinking needed africa has a low rate of industrialisation is heavily dependent on agriculture and its service sector has only recently started to emerge we have not escaped the colonial model basically africa remains a producer and exporter of raw materials said nubukpo he gave the example of cotton 97 pc of africa s cotton fibre is exported without processing the phase which adds value to raw materials and provides jobs for jean joseph boillot a researcher attached to the french institute for international and strategic affairs africa is still seeking an economic model of development there is very little development of local industries he said this can only be achieved through a very strong approach of continental industrial protection but this is undermined by the great powers in order to pursue free trade the chinese the indians and westerners want to be able to go on distributing their products governance problem lack of democracy transparency and efficient judicial systems are major brakes on african growth and wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few said the experts of the 40 states deemed last year to be the most world s most corrupt countries 20 are in sub saharan africa according to transparency international africa is not developing because it is caught in the trap of private wealth and the top wealth holders are african leaders said nubukpo we must promote democracy free and transparent elections to have legitimate leaders who have the public interest at heart which we absolutely do not have nyamnjoh also pointed to marginalised groups there should be more room for inclusivity of voices including voices of the young voices of women
in august i suggested buying the dip in the dominant chilean beer producer compania cervecerias unidas aka united breweries nyse ccu shares had fallen 15 primarily on unfavorable election results in argentina argentina is ccu s second largest market trailing only their domestic operations in chile however historically ccu has done alright even during hyper inflationary argentine periods so i argued the sell off was overdone ccu would get by fine despite political worries in argentina i stand by that piece of analysis as it is argentine stocks have come roaring back in recent weeks many individual issues there are up 50 100 since the october lows ccu s beer sales in argentina will be fine data by ycharts however what i didn t foresee was that ccu s home market chile would soon end up embroiled in political turmoil of its own i described the goings on in my article last month down 25 year to date buy chile on overblown political fear in any case there was major popular unrest that threatened the government s stability they eventually offered concessions to bring about social order these include a potential revision of the constitution later this year which leaves a fair bit of macro uncertainty lingering in the air regardless chilean stocks fell too far and have started to recover in recent weeks but there should be plenty more to come and the brewing giant ccu is a particularly strong option heading into 2020 while its business is recession resistant and a great thing to own during a potentially softer economy shares have gotten whacked just as hard as the chilean index overall that s a mistake and should lead to alpha in due time brexit 2016 vs chile 2019 in a large stock market with a ton of active market participants you d expect defensive stocks to get a bid as human analysts quickly work out the relative winners and losers from breaking news for example consider leading beer and liquor producer diageo deo it is headquartered in the united kingdom and thus was part of the brexit excitement as some folks were concerned about its supply chains and access to the european market in the wake of a potential exit from the eu regardless diageo stock immediately repriced higher following the initial brexit vote in june 2016 as active managers rotated their portfolios from cyclical british stocks into safe shelters such as british american bti and diageo data by ycharts following the june 2016 brexit vote defensive stocks immediately generated a fair bit of alpha versus their united kingdom index in chile this rotation to defensive stocks simply has not occurred both ccu and the local coca cola bottler embotelladora andina ako b have gotten slammed just as bad as the overall index etf ech look at the chart the correlation has gone to one on all these listings data by ycharts think about it though let s suppose that a downside bearish scenario plays out for chile in a case where the worst really does happen for chile politically would you rather own the local beer producer the local coca cola distributor or other more economically sensitive chilean holdings such as banks department stores and mining operations if you really think the recent protests will lead to a socialist swing in chile obviously owning stuff like banks and mining properties will be far riskier than owning consumer goods yet the market is pricing in zero difference in business quality or risk at the moment once again as is so often the case with latam political scares it appears people in new york are hitting the big red sell button on their exposure to the whole country with little discrimination to the underlying securities they are transacting in and i get why if you had a macroeconomic bullish case for chile it s suddenly a lot less promising now dumping the etf is the easy way to cut your losses but it s not an efficient or optimal approach and it leaves opportunity for individual investors willing to go the extra step and pick out discarded higher quality securities from the index how is ccu doing i received feedback from the previous ccu article that it was difficult to find information on the company there aren t published investor conference call transcripts for 2019 here at seeking alpha and you might need to poke around their investor relations site for a minute to find the english language content it does exist though and the quarterly earnings reports are translated and include a large chunk of ceo commentary in english so how did ccu do last quarter here s the opening of the q3 results as expected with the huge fall in the argentine peso recently ccu s overall results ended up looking messy ebitda dropped nearly 7 overall including a total wipeout of international ebitda for the third quarter if you re a multi year time horizon investor there s no need to get too concerned overall product sales volumes grew 6 for the quarter with all three segments chile international and wines growing nicely the 6 was actually an acceleration despite the iffy political climate as full year unit volume growth has come in at 4 9 over the long term if you grow your beer wine and soft drink sales 5 6 per year you re going to make a lot more money in the future than you do now despite all the short term currency swings the price of basic consumer products tends to come back to a median level sooner or later its revenues in dollars per unit of beverage sold has dropped over the past few years yet beer and soft drinks like big macs or starbucks lattes tends to reach similar pricing levels internationally over time and people note when they are unusually cheap or expensive in one market compared to another as of the last iteration of the big mac index published summer 2019 the chilean peso was 33 undervalued and at nearly its widest gap to fair value in 20 years and that discrepancy has only grown as the peso plunged this fall it s a sign that a country s currency is significantly mispriced when its multinational consumer products are selling for much less or more than they do in other countries long story short pricing will revert to the mean sooner or later the company s franchise grows more valuable from consistently selling more product not from exploiting short term currency swings however the average hedge fund manager can t buy a ccu type stock with the thesis that the company will be selling 30 more beer and soda five years from now than today and that pricing will work itself out over time when you have investors calling you every month if not every week demanding to know why the fund is trailing the market you don t have the luxury of buying a position like this and sitting on it until currency fluctuates in your favor and sentiment improves an active fund manager would need conviction that the currencies will swing ccu s way within 2020 if not the first quarter of the year to take a position in my previous ccu article i made the case for why earnings should be around 1 40 per share in a neutral operating environment 2019 s earnings are going to fall far short of that as argentine operating profits essentially vanished for the year with the currency move and the chilean profits are devalued in dollar terms thanks to their own domestic uncertainties it s not a change to the long term thesis though ccu will raise prices particularly in argentina to offset the higher inflation rate they ve operated in argentina through many years of grave economic uncertainty they can do it again meanwhile the cheap pesos do give them an operating advantage with the export wine business look how wine ebitda grew 29 this quarter all that gato negro and other such brands they sell to the u s and europe is suddenly is worth a lot more chilean pesos back home always gravitate toward companies with dollar revenues when dealing with an emerging market whose currency is slumping gato negro s awards source corporate website large internationally diversified operators like ccu can handle this sort of economic fluctuation the core business unit volume continues to grow at a strong clip if core earnings power is 1 40 share this year and you increase top line revenues 6 then baseline earnings should rise to 1 50 or so next year maybe we get 1 in practice because south american currencies remain weak maybe the dollar finally slumps in 2020 and we get significantly more than normal core earnings as fx swings in the company s favor in any case at recent prices ccu stock was selling at something like 12 13x its average annualized earnings that s the same valuation as molson coors tap which has had consistently declining sales volumes rather than ccu s 6 annual growth meanwhile ccu is at a 30 or so discount to its partner heineken otcqx heiny if chilean stocks go back up as i expect ccu should ride the index higher as well if chile misses my expectations ccu stock will still probably fare okay right now chilean stocks are all down big as the flood of sell orders for the whole country overwhelmed individual stock selections over time however defensive stocks like ccu should perform better than more exposed names like banks or retailers

volatility talking points in many regards the markets are still pricing in perfection for 2020 a low volatility steadfast growth for the global economy and financial system would be the outlier i cover some of the top grey swan low probability high impact events ahead what kind of trader are you take our dna fx quiz to gather insights on how to improve your analysis technique in trading circles there is exceptional appeal in trading so called black swans events that were wholly unpredictable have a severe impact on the market and tend to be unreasonably rationalized after their occurrence such extremes will naturally drawl an inordinate amount of attention owing to the impact that they have the snipe hunting that occurs among those overly ambitious traders boils down to the preternatural pursuit of volatility the tales of entering a market at a high or low and just before activity levels are about to shift seem widespread such a story has no doubt had an impact on all of our excitement to one degree or another at some time in our participation in the market and while black swans have stirred substantial moves even reversals in the past predicting them is a fool s errand of too many red herrings and false starts to be practical that public service announcement made there are events for which an intense impact is still a possibility but for which their occurrence is at least a possible blip on the radar they are still considered unlikely as that is where the market moving potential resides otherwise markets would adjust to the inevitability that is what i want focus on in this outlook for 2020 there are a number of different scenarios that could befall grace our newswires and charts but i want to focus in on events that combine a significant influence that also near the realm of probability i will list 5 of the most remarkable events on my list discuss the background assess my probability of its occurring and identify a market i feel is most likely to reflect the development s p 500 finally enters lasting reversal 50 this is perhaps one of the most heavily debated consideration year in and year out will the markets finally collapse the instrument you use to measure the markets is important as looking at a thermometer won t necessarily give you a good reading on whether an overinflated balloon is about to pop however i like to refer to the s p 500 as my metric given its default enthusiasm this past decade as one of the best performing benchmarks if it is committed to a decline the implications for the whole system are much clearer i have been a conscientious objector of the buy and hold view on markets since 2015 that does not mean i won t position with a long risk bias rather i do not believe in the steadfastness of the climb and will not simply hold a long term momentum position that aligns to risk on the reason for this is the deviation from traditional scales of value like growth returns or other standards the market is happy to change its reasoning to suit as the saying goes markets can remain irrational longer than you can solvent but eventually the discrepancy will reach a breaking point since justification for greater exposure is adaptive the turn on the most hated bull market of all time will occur in sentiment rather through an event recognition of the stretch in speculative exposure the discrepancy with value and abundance of ready made fundamental landmines makes this a higher probability in my view than what the market is affording despite the general belief of inevitability no deal brexit at end of transition period 50 after the december 12 general election in the united kingdom confidence flooded back into the british pound a uniform view of how the uk negotiation team will deal its eu counterpart revived confidence after years of impasse between the own nation s government and parliament yet the sterling didn t hold onto that climb long after the polls were in that was owing to prime minister johnson s warning that he meant to push europe to compromise by suggesting he may preclude any extensions on the transition period which is set to end at the very close of 2020 december 31st 2020 recommended by john kicklighter get your free gbp forecast get my guide to this point much of the debate has been around the sudden cliff that comes with the inability to agree to the withdrawal the previously established withdrawal agreement is likely to be implemented come january 31st the deadline after the extension from october but this is a question of the work to make replacement trade deals after the agreement to split most economists agree that it is very unlikely the two sides can work out an alternative environment in so short a time which makes this a considerable risk on the other hand the event would come as less a sudden development given a clear deadline and plenty of debate beforehand what s more the pound is still historically low then again it can always fall further chart of gbpusd with 50 week moving average monthly chart created using ig chart platform president trump wins re election 40 markets generally do not reflect the typical favor or distaste for a politician that opinion polls reflect but they abhor uncertainty and policy that upends growth in economy and the financial system heading into the 2016 presidential election donald trump was the agent of change given his atypical political approach and his uneven approach that said it was quite the surprise for me that the us equity market responded to the surprise election results with a steadfast rally through the subsequent year that is certainly not the norm moving into this new election trump is up for re election and his policy stance is more transparent his support for tax cut driven growth was tested and fell short of a lasting lever for the us economy infrastructure spending which was a big part of his platform never garnered traction has not gained any tangible traction in the meantime trade wars aimed at rebalancing the global pace of growth has instead led to slower domestic and global growth a re election for the president would embolden his administration to push forward with the punitive trade policies that could push growth to stall speed given the ongoing impeachment proceedings it may seem that a second term is a low probability following the opinion polls for quantitative measurement but the bifurcation in american society that is mirrored so well in politics means extreme politicking is the norm with the

election will play a considerable role on future phases of the country s involvement in trade wars since march 2018 the trade barriers with china have grown to enormous proportion the two countries have imposed tariffs on over 450 billion in goods collectively further blacklists were raised blacklists were implemented and threats for further moves were warned the first and only meaningful de escalation took place this past month when both sides finally decided to verify intent to the phase one trade deal though details were worryingly spare despite the number of times previous breakthroughs were waved off it is somewhat surprising that the market took such an enthusiastic view of the outcome we have seen too many false dawns on this relationship front before it would be reasonable to maintain a cautious view of these two countries ability to find a genuine compromise however there is strong motivation on both sides to speed up and perhaps capitulate on the us side the approach of the election and the unflattering pace of economic activity may find a useful lever even if temporary in progressively backing out of the economic grip from trade wars for china there are multiple fronts of uncertainty emerging while the effort to transition to a more open market based economy to spread out risk is happening at the same time as a global struggle both sides have reason to find that middle ground if the us strikes an accord with its chinese counterpart earlier in 2020 it is likely that the white house positions the outcome as a win and attempt to double down on the populist fervor it attempts to ignite that being the case the next white whale for the us would be europe the two are already two steps into a mild trade ware of their own the us has slapped over 7 billion in tariffs on eu imports after the wto s ruling that europe unfairly subsidized airbus and the eu is anticipating an outcome for its own case sometime in january further france slapped a digital tax on the largest tech companies many being us and the trump administration responded with a plan of direct tariffs of its own this could readily escalate with little warning and the economic implications of the world s largest developed economies engaging would be far more disruptive some would prefer to watch risk trends or audusd more directly for this but i think usdcnh is the

chart platform major central banks change their standard policy mix 25 finally the more unorthodox and underappreciated grey swan in 2020 is a more systemic shift in monetary policy it is no secret that the world s largest central banks are failing to achieve the financial stability that they so desperately seek to inspire and that isn t even their stated mandate most of the major authorities are targeting inflation while some also have a more directly growth linked objective like employment given how suppressed inflation pressures have been throughout the post gfc great financial crisis recovery and the lackluster sheen of economic performance questions start to arise those concerns are born out of the knowledge that the world s largest central banks have collectively cut rates to virtually zero and flooded the market with stimulus qe and other such programs there is a problem when the technical goals are either reached by the central bank without the expected effect on the economy or worse the ammunition is expended without ever reaching the state goal what are the authorities to do they don t have many options they can simply hope that the world s economy simply grows out of its problems they could continue to push the same policies and expect a different outcome or they could change the stated goal regardless of the decision a change of course is necessary many would write this issue off as a wonky matter that will not have clear practical influence on markets however i believe it could materially change the balance of risk in the system and many investors

the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centres under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the un to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in un food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other un teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention centre according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials in many cases the money goes to neighbouring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention centre she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by un staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the centre she could not say who got the money she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention centre where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centres in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal un emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the un s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a un brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centres a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the un say they want the centres closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centres libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centres uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the un to spend the money wisely the un said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centres to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the un refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centres about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centres at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak un backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention centre named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the un s migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the centre are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the centre according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under un sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to un aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs centre twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the centre and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention centre the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the centre which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarek al sikka a detention centre in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a centre an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centres profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labour hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centres had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention centre or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms centre acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the centre i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the centre closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs centre said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the centre s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs centre which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centres they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the un and the eu the iom the un s agency for migration highlights its co operation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centres the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the un s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact un staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a un sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither centre responded to requests for comment the iom the un migration agency acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said safa msehli the spokeswoman for the un s international organization for migration failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men women and children the story of abdullah a sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is all told the group of 47 in his first crossing from tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed libyan and his cronies 127 000 in a mix of dollars euros and libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention centre and cross in two boats they were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed libyan shaken down for their cellphones and more money and tossed back into detention we talked to him and asked him why did you let us out and then arrest us said abdullah who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation he beat two of us who brought it up abdullah later ended up in the al nasr martyrs detention centre where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality ethiopians 5 000 somalis 6 800 moroccans and egyptians 8 100 and finally bangladeshis a minimum 18 500 across the board women pay more abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee last july he and 18 others paid 48 000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours after a few days stuck at sea off the libyan coast under a sweltering sun they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end instead they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by tunisian fishermen who took them back to tunisia there are only three ways out of the prison you escape you pay ransom or you die abdullah said referring to the detention centre in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centres and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the eu wants them to prevent letting migrants cross according to tarik lamloum the head of the libyan human rights organization beladi traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around 10 000 per boat that is allowed to pass with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favourable he said the head of libya s department for combating irregular migration or dcim the agency responsible for the detention centres under the ministry of interior acknowledged corruption and collusion among the militias and the coast guard and traffickers and even within the government itself they are in bed with them as well as people from my own agency said al mabrouk abdel hafez skimming profits beyond the direct abuse of migrants the militia network also profits by siphoning off money from eu funds sent for their food and security even those earmarked for a un run migrant centre according to more than a dozen officials and aid workers in libya and tunisia as well as internal un emails and meeting minutes seen by the associated press an audit in may of the unhcr the un refugee agency responsible for the centre found a lack of oversight and accountability at nearly all levels of spending in the libya mission the audit identified inexplicable payments in american dollars to libyan firms and deliveries of goods that were never verified in december 2018 during the period reviewed in the audit the un launched its migrant centre in tripoli known as the gathering and departure facility or gdf as an alternative to detention for the recipients of the services contracts sent through the libyan government agency libaid it was a windfall millions of euros in contracts for food and migrant aid went to at least one company linked to al khoja the militia leader flown to rome for the un migration meeting according to internal un emails seen by the ap two senior libyan officials and an international aid worker al khoja is also the deputy head of the dcim the government agency responsible for the detention centres one of the libyan officials saw the multimillion euro catering contract with a company named ard al watan or the land of the nation which al khoja controls we feel like this is al khoja s fiefdom he controls everything he shuts the doors and he opens the doors said the official a former employee at the un centre who like other libyan officials spoke anonymously out of fear for his safety he said al khoja used sections of the un centre to train his militia fighters and built a luxury apartment inside even as the contracts for the un centre were negotiated libyan officials said three libyan government agencies including the prosecutor s office were investigating al khoja in connection with the disappearance of 570 million from government spending allocated to feed migrants in detention centres in the west at the time al khoja already ran another centre for migrants tarik al sikka notorious for abuses including beating hard labour and a massive ransom scheme tekila an eritrean refugee said that for two years at tarik al sikka he and other migrants lived on macaroni even after he was among 25 people who came down with tuberculosis a disease exacerbated by malnutrition tekila asked that only his first name be used for his safety when there is little food there is no choice but to go to sleep he said despite internal un emails warning of severe malnutrition inside tarik al sikka un officials in february and march 2018 repeatedly visited the detention centre to negotiate the future opening of the gdf ap saw emails confirming that by july 2018 the unhcr s chief of mission was notified that companies controlled by al khoja s militia would receive subcontracts for services yaxley the spokesman for unhcr emphasized that the officials the un refugee agency works with are all under the authority of the ministry of interior he said unhcr monitors expenses to make sure its standard rules are followed and may withhold payments otherwise a senior official at libaid the libyan government agency that managed the centre with the un said the contracts are worth at least 7 million for catering cleaning and security and 30 out of the 65 libaid staff were essentially ghost employees who showed up on the payroll sight unseen the un centre was a treasure trove the senior libaid official lamented there was no way you could operate while being surrounded by tripoli militias it was a big gamble an internal un memo from february 2019 shows it was aware of the problem the memo found a high risk that food for the un centre was being diverted to militias given the amount budgeted compared to the amount migrants were eating in general around 50 dinars a day or 35 is budgeted per detainee for food and other essentials for all centres according to two libyan officials two owners of food catering companies and an international aid worker of that only around 2 dinars is actually spent on meals according to their rough calculations and migrants descriptions yaxley the spokesman for the unhcr said the un refugee agency monitors expenses to make sure its standard rules are followed and may withhold payments otherwise he also emphasized that the officials unhcr works with are all under the authority of the ministry of interior despite the investigations into al khoja tarik al sikka and another detention centre shared a 996 000 euro grant from the eu and italy in february at the zawiya centre emergency goods delivered by un agencies ended up redistributed half for the prisoners half for the workers said orobosa bright a nigerian who endured three stints there for a total of 11 months many of the goods end up on libya s black market as well libyan officials and international aid workers say despite the corruption the detention system in libya is still expanding in places with money from europe at a detention centre in sabaa where migrants are already going hungry they were forced to build yet another wing funded by the italian government said lamloum the libyan aid worker the italian government did not respond to a request for comment lamloum sent a photo of the new prison it has no windows tunisia laundering the money earned off the suffering of migrants is whitewashed in money laundering operations in tunisia libya s neighbour in the town of ben gardane dozens of money changing stalls transform libyan dinars dollars and euros into tunisian currency before the money continues on its way to the capital tunis even libyans without residency can open a bank account tunisia also offers another opportunity for militia networks to make money off european funds earmarked for migrants because of libya s dysfunctional banking system where cash is scarce and militias control accounts international organizations give contracts usually in dollars to libyan organizations with bank accounts in tunisia the vendors compound the money the money on libya s black market exchange which ranges between 4 and 9 times greater than the official rate libya s government handed over more than 100 files to tunisia earlier this year listing companies under investigation for fraud and money laundering the companies largely involve militia warlords and politicians according to nadia saadi a manager at the tunisian anti corruption authority the laundering involves cash payments for real estate falsified customs documents and faked bills for fictitious companies all in all libya is run by militias said a senior libyan judicial official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of risking his life whatever governments say and whatever uniform they wear or stickers they put this is the bottom line husni bey a prominent businessman in libya said the idea of europe sending aid money to libya a once wealthy country suffering from corruption was ill conceived from the beginning europe wants to buy those who can stop smuggling with all of these programs bey said they would be much better off blacklisting the names of those involved in human trafficking fuel and drug smuggling and charging them with crimes instead of giving them money ___

trump insisted for months that he wanted to resolve all outstanding trade issues with china in a single comprehensive accord that would refashion the chinese state s economic role as late as september he rejected talk of a partial agreement saying instead that he wanted the big deal the two sides discussed industrial subsidies in the early rounds of negotiations over an agreement that exceeded 150 pages but chinese officials resisted making structural changes and by the time officials settled this month on an 86 page partial accord any commitments to reduce subsidies had been excised chinese steel mills solar panel manufacturers electric battery developers shipbuilders and oil producers all benefit from a vast web of government support officials in beijing arm chinese companies against their foreign rivals with discounted loans from state banks cheap land low cost electric power and cash infusions from officially approved investment funds the chinese effort is dogged long term and very well funded said john neuffer chief executive of the semiconductor industry association that s why the subsidy issue is such a big one for us under chinese president xi jinping who lacks his predecessors enthusiasm for the free market the state spigot has gushed aid china now devotes more than 3 percent of its annual output to direct and indirect business subsidies a share of the economy that is roughly equivalent to what the united states spends on defense according to economist nicholas lardy of the peterson institute for international economics a nonpartisan research group some of that aid is similar to programs in the united states and other advanced nations encouraging companies to retrain workers use less energy or otherwise support government goals but much of it is divorced from any consideration of profit and loss so it fuels excess production of goods like steel which spill into global markets depressing prices and making it hard for american companies to compete trump last year imposed tariffs on steel after the commerce department warned that the u s share of global production had fallen by nearly two thirds since 2000 under pressure from heavily subsidized chinese mills at the same time signs that china was lavishing state aid on efforts to supplant the united states as the global leader in advanced technology triggered trump s decision to launch his trade war with beijing subsidies are marbled throughout china s state led economy for chinese leaders they are a principal tool of economic management allowing them to steer credit land energy and other resources to favored state owned enterprises as well as private companies that beijing sees as strategic whatever the cost beijing s aid gives chinese companies an important edge in other markets peter navarro the president s principal white house trade adviser calls state subsidies one of china s seven deadly sins which must be cured before the two countries can enjoy normal trade ties in a 215 page report last year which kicked off trump s trade war with china robert e lighthizer the president s chief trade negotiator identified government financial support as a key element in china s plan to overtake u s technology leadership china is grossly subsidizing and taking over our markets he complained this summer before the senate finance committee but this massive program of government assistance has proved a double edged sword for china state help enabled chinese manufacturers to dominate markets for products such as auto parts but it also has left the economy riddled with unprofitable zombie firms and suffering from pervasive inefficiency economists said these subsidies are being directed in ways that are really distorting they are not being directed to dynamic firms said loren brandt an economist at the university of toronto indeed state owned firms have become steadily less profitable as they have gotten bigger over the decade to 2017 the biggest state owned enterprises nearly quadrupled their assets but their returns fell to 2 6 percent from a peak of 6 7 percent in 2007 even as they underperform state companies continue to enjoy easy access to loans from state banks meanwhile private companies with brighter prospects often struggle to obtain credit a lot of money s getting wasted there s a massive misallocation of resources in underperforming state companies said lardy author of the state strikes back the end of economic reform in china white house officials have acknowledged that some key issues remain unresolved lighthizer has said a lot of hard things have been left to future talks which most analysts say will be arduous and unlikely to bear fruit before the november election bargaining over industrial subsidies is expected to be particularly tough though trump launched the trade war to get china to change practices including its numerous subsidies the commercial conflict has only convinced xi to accelerate efforts to become self sufficient no matter the cost the hard liner view they re the ones who seem to have xi jinping s ear or this is the way xi thinks himself said brandt but it s clear that the more reformist constituency has lost out the world trade organization prohibits subsidies that are directly linked to exports or that require the use of domestic goods the u s has won at least three disputes over chinese subsidies before the global trading body including in 2011 when china agreed to halt a program of wind turbine subsidies after u s complaints but the wto rules are poorly designed for a nonmarket economy of china s size and importance to global trade one problem is keeping track of the subsidies which are often hidden or indirect chinese makers of aluminum products appear to be driven by profits but they benefit from government policies that provide cheap energy to the smelters that produce aluminum and from export limits that lead to a domestic glut which keeps aluminum prices down too they can be really effective selling into the u s or europe said chad bown another peterson economist it s just that all of their inputs are subsidized after china labeled shipbuilding a strategic industry in 2006 the government funded several new shipyards and an array of subsidies that saved the industry up to 4 5 billion over a six year period according to research by economist myrto kalouptsidi of harvard university china quickly doubled its market share from roughly one quarter of world ship orders to half grabbing business from japan south korea and europe only after analyzing shipyards in several countries and ruling out alternative explanations was kalouptsidi able to estimate the extent of chinese subsidies it is practically impossible to explain the rapid increase in china s market share without fingering subsidies she wrote in a 2018 paper under wto rules the u s can impose steep tariffs to counteract the effects of a trading partner s subsidies if they injure american companies the administration has stepped up its use of trade remedies to counter chinese subsidies hitting in the past two months imports of steel staples diamond saw blades hardwood lumber and ceramic tiles with defensive levies of as much as 356 percent about 10 percent of all chinese imports more than 50 billion worth of goods now face countersubsidy or anti dumping tariffs according to bown that is apart from separate levies the president imposed on 360 billion in chinese products over the past 18 months using such tariffs offers little prospect of success though against china s multipronged effort to promote its domestic semiconductor industry chinese central and provincial governments have earmarked about 100 billion for equity investments credit lines and various grants over the next five years so china will become by 2030 the global leader in an industry now dominated by u s firms private equity funds backed by the state are funneling cash into china s semiconductor industry helping build and outfit dozens of new fabrication plants there are now more than 1 600 of these government guided funds commanding a total of 570 billion according to zero2ipo research center a beijing based consultancy unlike traditional private equity investors in the u s these chinese funds are willing to accept subpar returns to meet government goals two chinese companies smic and tsinghua unigroup derive more than 30 percent of their annual revenue from government payments yet they offer their government investors below market returns according to a new study by the organization for economic cooperation and development in paris such investments are probably among the hardest forms of support to identify and quantify the oecd concluded despite years of free spending chinese semiconductor manufacturers remain far behind the u s state of the art even failed industrial policy however can distort global trade flows and hurt non chinese companies while the u s industry retains a solid lead over aspiring chinese rivals the semiconductor industry s neuffer says the administration needs a broader response along with combating chinese trade practices the u s should be emphasizing workforce development competition policy and opening other markets overseas we need an affirmative agenda too he said
hey there time traveller this article was published 30 12 2019 1560 days ago so information in it may no longer be current tripoli libya when the european union started funneling millions of euros into libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the mediterranean the money came with eu promises to improve detention centres notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking that hasn t happened instead the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found the eu has sent more than 327 9 million euros to libya with an additional 41 million approved in early december largely channeled through u n agencies the ap found that in a country without a functioning government huge sums of european money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants in some cases u n officials knew militia networks were getting the money according to internal emails file in this tuesday oct 1 2019 file photo rescued migrants are seated next to a coast guard boat in the city of khoms libya around 120 kilometers 75 miles east of tripoli when millions of euros started flowing from the european union into libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the mediterranean the money came with eu promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and to stop human trafficking that hasn t happened ap photo hazem ahmed file the militias torture extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centres under the nose of the u n often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centres sold to traffickers or to other centres the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centres under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the u n to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in u n food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other u n teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention centre according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials in many cases the money goes to neighbouring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention centre she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by u n staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the centre she could not say who got the money she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention centre where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centres in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal u n emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the u n s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a u n brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centres a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the u n say they want the centres closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centres libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centres uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the u n to spend the money wisely the u n said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centres to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the u n refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centres about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centres at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak u n backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention centre named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the u n migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the centre are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the centre according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under u n sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to u n aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs centre twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the centre and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention centre the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the centre which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarik al sikka a detention centre in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a centre an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centres profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labour hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centres had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention centre or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms centre acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the centre i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the centre closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs centre said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the centre s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs centre which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centres they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the u n and the eu the iom highlights its co operation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centres the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the u n s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact u n staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a u n sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither centre responded to requests for comment the u n s international organization for migration acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to

in this sept 23 2019 photo rescued migrants look at a map of europe aboard the ocean viking humanitarian ship as it sails in the mediterranean sea the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative business in part funded by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found ap photo renata brito when the european union started funneling millions of euros into libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the mediterranean the money came with eu promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking that hasn t happened instead the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found advertisement the eu has sent more than 327 9 million euros to libya with an additional 41 million approved in early december largely channeled through u n agencies the ap found that in a country without a functioning government huge sums of european money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants in some cases u n officials knew militia networks were getting the money according to internal emails the militias torture extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the u n often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers sold to traffickers or to other centers the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe advertisement the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the u n to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in u n food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other u n teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials in many cases the money goes to neighboring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ advertisement this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya advertisement aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention center she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by u n staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the center she could not say who got the money advertisement she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention center where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal u n emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the u n s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr advertisement but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a u n brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centers a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the u n say they want the centers closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers advertisement libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the u n to spend the money wisely the u n said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants advertisement unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the u n refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said advertisement julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centers advertisement about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak u n backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention center named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the u n migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under u n sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment advertisement many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to u n aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs center twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers advertisement they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the center and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum advertisement i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention center the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the center which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarik al sikka a detention center in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends advertisement the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a center an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labor hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms center acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center advertisement i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the center closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs center said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs center which is also being used for weapons storage advertisement trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the u n and the eu the iom highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe advertisement this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya advertisement the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the u n s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact u n staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a u n sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither center responded to requests for comment advertisement the u n s international organization for migration acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said iom spokeswoman safa msehli failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men women and children the story of abdullah a sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is advertisement all told the group of

the real role of the liberal class luis buñuel s surrealist film the exterminating angel is many things to many people the eye of the bewildered beholder beholden to his or her personal perspective conditions the response the plot is straightforward a small coterie of wealthy mexicans convene for a dinner party only to find that they cannot leave the party literally there is no apparent physical impediment nothing visual blocks their exodus rather it is a kind of psychic inanition that collapses their will to leave as each guest variously attempts to cross the threshold a thought pops into his or her head rationalizing a reason to stay a coffee breakfast an argument a love tryst it makes no difference no one leaves these haut monde citizens are quite conscious of their predicament but consciousness of the problem is no solution it is an ingenious plot sinfully simple bafflingly motiveless some say the film variously mocks the cinema experience itself others that it slyly savages religion still others say it means nothing in good surrealist fashion but perhaps the marxist lens is especially apposite the cast are drawn from mid fifties mexican melodramas having built their careers dramatizing the efete dilemmas of bourgeois life what today we call first world problems they convincingly portray a cast of elites who cannot fix the simplest of problems in this sense the movie prefigures our own bourgeoisie and the professional class cum liberal intelligentsia more broadly the same sterility of action haunts our liberal corridors problems of human health for which we abound with solutions cannot be solved needless bloodshed for which we burn blood and treasure cannot be meaningfully addressed rampaging institutional racism and chronic fascism at home and abroad are never countenanced but with the thinnest bromides buñuel s gentility cannot exit their dinner party our liberal class cannot exit neoliberalism the liberal class is beholden to lesser evil voting a reductionist ethic that refuses to consider the long term consequences of employing it they turn a blind eye to the rightward drift of a bipartisan political class with no leftward pressure an actuality created by strident party allegiance stopping short part of the reason liberalism is weak is because it cannot follow the path of its sentiments to their obvious conclusion it stops short of the logical endpoint of its rhetorical nods to solidarity which is socialism unwilling to exit the duopoly incapable of system level critique fearful of revolution liberals narrow their animus to their alter ego in the duopoly what is wrong is the fault of republicans who stonewall well intentioned democrats at every turn in this sense problems are off ramped into diversionary side shows like the present impeachment hysteria as the carnival roars ahead democrats sign on to vast war budgets the militarization of space and the swift rubber stamping of a raft of trump judicial nominees these gross capitulations are elbowed out of view with piecemeal reform which indicates the true goal of modern liberals effecting meaningful change without changing their lives in any meaningful way this perpetual off ramping ensures the problem is never seen as systemic a system critique would in the end identify the liberal class itself as a mechanism of the status quo a release valve for endemic popular frustration rather than a tool of revolutionary transformation like exterminating angels liberals neoliberals in practice work to exterminate the threat of truly progressive government led reform i e socialist policy no stopping power this is why liberals are weak against capitalist fascism they cannot claim a valid ideology to fight it with tempering neoliberalism is all they ve got socialism is the ideology that can and has worked but liberals have been convinced that communism leads to mass murder hence they are left to weakly decry the excesses of capitalism and limply argue for modest reforms there s little doubt about the benefits that socialist command economies deliver to their populations the metrics are clear from the economic figures from the soviet union to the decades of stunning growth in china since the chinese communist revolution the remarkable turnarounds led by evo morales in bolivia and hugo chavez in venezuela not to mention lula inácio lula da silva in brazil but all of these achievements have been either scrubbed from modern history or attributed to capitalism through widespread multi decade disinformation campaigns liberals indeed all of us tend to overlook the evidence of socialist uplift in our own country aside from the new deal as michael parenti has astutely noted how many private industries owe their existence to government funded research and development from public transportation infrastructure to satellite communications the internet nuclear power and aeronautics the role of federal funding is immense then there s the state university system another widely effective project of social uplift the federal role of which is widely ignored in an orwellian sense the non plus ultra of socialist success is the defense industry a system that consumes half of federal discretionary spending to fuel the pentagon system and the weapons farms that supply it this is partly why bernie sanders will likely lose in 2020 aside from the institutional barriers erected partly by liberals themselves and relentlessly negative corporate media coverage sanders has rallied considerable support for new deal liberalism but has stopped there he never mentions the socio economic achievements of the ussr and china because he has made a political calculation that embracing such examples outside the spectrum of acceptable thought would be political suicide yet not going all the way will guarantee the ultimate failure of his project only embracing a dictatorship of workers would generate enough support for a revolution regardless of capitalist class schemes to undermine his campaign not only would his policies never be enacted short of mass socialist revolt he never speaks of the inevitable rollback that is the immediate consequence of progressive policy in a capitalist society in this respect sanders represents the limitations of liberalism and demonstrates why it is incapable of challenging capitalist imperialism at best it can achieve limited reforms subject to swift repeal by the fascist right forgotten legacies if the liberal camp has forsaken the historic success of various socialist projects it has likewise glossed over the failures of its own tepid reformism for liberals already sliding into the warren camp a predictable outcome given their historical behavior here is what we got with our last so called liberal president we should note that some 200 former obama employees are now stumping for warren who represents the same milquetoast centrism as our erstwhile leader as author chris hedges has repeatedly noted obama should be remembered for his refusal to prosecute any members of the bush administration for their war crimes it is the simplest of adages if crime isn t punished then crime pays note how war crimes are not impeachment worthy but a little foreign aid quid pro quo is if might score political points the assault on civil liberties was worse under obama than bush including an unprecedented assault on whistleblowers and due process related to enemy combatants and detained american citizens the dramatic expansion of drone warfare was executed under obama at the behest of fanatical consigliere john brennan the 2002 aumf was reinterpreted by the obama department of justice to sanction the killing of american citizens the deliberate use of al qaeda and related franchises to destabilize syria with a proxy war leading to some 500 000 dead and 13 million displaced 5 million exiled from the country the deliberate use of a no fly zone to conduct a brutal regime change in libya where nato acted as al qaeda s de facto air force obama s recovery delivered 95 percent of the economic rebound into the calf skinned wallets of obscene wealth a decade after the 2008 meltdown the average net worth of the average middle class family was 40 000 lower than it had been before the crash the net worth of black families is down 40 percent and latino households down 46 percent nobody expects recovery the lavish multi trillion dollar bailout of corrupt wall street banks which caused the 2007 2008 financial crisis all while handing crumbs to homeowners defaulting in record numbers the enactment of the affordable care act an orwellian health insurance scheme invented by republicans written by the insurance lobby and forcibly imposed on the american public leading to a dramatic inflation of healthcare costs ongoing individual bankruptcies due to medical debt reimbursement shortfalls and the utterly cynical separation of healthcare access from healthcare itself while providing some appreciable relief at the bottom end of the consumer pyramid it was in retrospect a means of forestalling medicare for all and of unburdening businesses of their role looking after the health of their employees the open declaration that venezuela was a national security threat entraining lethal sanctions that have only been ratcheted up by the trump administration quite predictably some 40 000 have died as a result the facilitation and support of regime change in ukraine generating border tensions with russia a civil war inside ukraine and a new cold war internationally the obama administration s uptick in hostility toward russia created the ideological context in which russiagate was sure to flourish it was obama s ndaa that allowed troops to conduct missions on american soil it was obama s ndaa that legalized domestic propaganda it was the cia under obama that illegally spied on congress it was the fbi and cia under obama that ginned up the false pretexts to spy on a presidential campaign the falsification of the need to spy on the trump presidential campaign led directly to the chimerical russiagate scandal that has rocked the presidency and critically helped the military intelligence industrial complex constrain trump s foreign policy instincts on which he campaigned it was the obama administration that delivered a record setting military aid package to the apartheid state of israel including refusal to sanction israel for its brutal attack on palestinian people in 2014 all these realities must be brushed aside so as not to obscure our view of the incremental prosperity that democrats claim to deliver but even this promise that the democrats will deliver progress in the long run is false both parties preside over decline not progress it is the nature of decline that is at stake each quadrennial death by a thousand cuts or a bullet to the body politic simply look at the barometers of prosperity since the implementation of neoliberalism in the early 1970s during the long boom from the post war era to the early seventies productivity was hitched to wages thanks to labor unions and other forms of class struggle since 1973 when neoliberal economics were being implemented with increasing fervor american productivity has gone up 77 percent wages by 12 percent this gap accounts in part for the increasing percentage of the nation s wealth hoarded by elites end game the liberal class practices a kind of deliberate cognitive dissonance despite having informed opinion at their fingertips they do not connect the democrats to human destruction though obama generated untold suffering across eight wars they do not connect sanctions to economic destruction though obama declared venezuela a national security threat and implemented sanctions that ratcheted up by the trump regime have turned a once robust venezuelan economy into a derelict engine of instability they do not connect ngos to civic destruction though democratic use of ngo front organizations in venezuela and ukraine and libya have produced everything from commodity hoarding to street violence and slave labor they do not connect corporate media to reputation destruction though they literally watched bernie sanders destroyed by lies and negligence from the media proxies of the very party he embraced they connect none of these events to a bipartisan neoliberal capitalism the unhinged engine of supra national exploitation that is the core cause of declining life prospects inside the empire and extinguished life prospects outside it so we are left with an effete professional class of lip sync liberals who repeat the platitudes of friendly fascism before retiring back to their bunkers of creature comforts when asked if there was a difference between the democratic and republican parties hedges replied of course there s a difference it is how you want corporate fascism delivered to you do you want it delivered by a princeton educated goldman sachs criminal or do you want it delivered by a racist nativist christian fascist the fundamental engines of oligarchic global corporate power are advanced by both parties one tries to present it in a multicultural inclusive way the other is embraced by troglodytes believing the democratic party will save us is a kind of willful blindness like buñuel s surrealist depiction it is the liberal class echoing the rhetoric of hope and solidarity that truly exterminate the possibility of either
tripoli libya ap when the european union started funneling millions of euros into libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the mediterranean the money came with eu promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking that hasn t happened instead the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found the eu has sent more than 327 9 million euros to libya with an additional 41 million approved in early december largely channeled through u n agencies the ap found that in a country without a functioning government huge sums of european money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants in some cases u n officials knew militia networks were getting the money according to internal emails the militias torture extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the u n often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers sold to traffickers or to other centers the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the u n to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in u n food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other u n teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials advertising in many cases the money goes to neighboring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention center she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by u n staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the center she could not say who got the money advertising she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention center where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal u n emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the u n s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a u n brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centers a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the u n say they want the centers closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers advertising libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the u n to spend the money wisely the u n said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the u n refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said advertising julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centers about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak u n backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention center named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the u n migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under u n sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to u n aid workers advertising families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs center twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the center and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention center the most beautiful in the country advertising at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the center which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarik al sikka a detention center in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a center an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labor hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms center acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the center closed last year advertising a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs center said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs center which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the u n and the eu the iom highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement advertising what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the u n s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact u n staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a u n sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither center responded to requests for comment the u n s international organization for migration acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said iom spokeswoman safa msehli failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men women and children advertising the story of abdullah a sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is all told the group of 47 in his first crossing from tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed libyan and his cronies 127 000 in a mix of dollars euros and libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention center and cross in two boats they were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed libyan shaken down for their cell phones and more money and tossed back into detention we talked to him and asked him why did you let us out and then arrest us said abdullah who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation he beat two of us who brought it up abdullah later ended up in the al nasr martyrs detention center where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality ethiopians 5 000 somalis 6 800 moroccans and egyptians 8 100 and finally bangladeshis a minimum 18 500 across the board women pay more abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee last july he and 18 others paid 48 000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours after a few days stuck at sea off the libyan coast under a sweltering sun they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end instead they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by tunisian fishermen who took them back to tunisia advertising there are only three ways out of the prison you escape you pay ransom or you die abdullah said referring to the detention center in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centers and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the eu wants them to prevent letting migrants cross according to tarik lamloum the head of the libyan human rights organization beladi traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around 10 000 per boat that is allowed to pass with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favorable he said the head of libya s department for combating irregular migration or dcim the agency responsible for the detention centers under the ministry of interior acknowledged corruption and collusion among the militias and the coast guard and traffickers and even within the government itself they are in bed with them as well as people from my own agency said al mabrouk abdel hafez skimming profits beyond the direct abuse of migrants the militia network also profits by siphoning off money from eu funds sent for their food and security even those earmarked for a u n run migrant center according to more than a dozen officials and aid workers in libya and tunisia as well as internal u n emails and meeting minutes seen by the associated press advertising an audit in may of the unhcr the u n refugee agency responsible for the center found a lack of oversight and accountability at nearly all levels of spending in the libya mission the audit identified inexplicable payments in american dollars to libyan firms and deliveries of goods that were never verified in december 2018 during the period reviewed in the audit the u n launched its migrant center in tripoli known as the gathering and departure facility or gdf as an alternative to detention for the recipients of the services contracts sent through the libyan government agency libaid it was a windfall millions of euros in contracts for food and migrant aid went to at least one company linked to al khoja the militia leader flown to rome for the u n migration meeting according to internal u n emails seen by the ap two senior libyan officials and an international aid worker al khoja is also the deputy head of the dcim the government agency responsible for the detention centers one of the libyan officials saw the multimillion euro catering contract with a company named ard al watan or the land of the nation which al khoja controls we feel like this is al khoja s fiefdom he controls everything he shuts the doors and he opens the doors said the official a former employee at the u n center who like other libyan officials spoke anonymously out of fear for his safety he said al khoja used sections of the u n center to train his militia fighters and built a luxury apartment inside even as the contracts for the u n center were negotiated libyan officials said three libyan government agencies were investigating al khoja in connection with the disappearance of 570 million from government spending allocated to feed migrants in detention centers in the west advertising at the time al khoja already ran another center for migrants tarik al sikka notorious for abuses including beating hard labor and a massive ransom scheme tekila an eritrean refugee said that for two years at tarik al sikka he and other migrants lived on macaroni even after he was among 25 people who came down with tuberculosis a disease exacerbated by malnutrition tekila asked that only his first name be used for his safety when there is little food there is no choice but to go to sleep he said despite internal u n emails warning of severe malnutrition inside tarik al sikka u n officials in february and march 2018 repeatedly visited the detention center to negotiate the future opening of the gdf ap saw emails confirming that by july 2018 the unhcr s chief of mission was notified that companies controlled by al khoja s militia would receive subcontracts for services yaxley the spokesman for unhcr emphasized that the officials the agency works with are all under the authority of the ministry of interior he said unhcr monitors expenses to make sure its standard rules are followed and may withhold payments otherwise a senior official at libaid the libyan government agency that managed the center with the u n said the contracts are worth at least 7 million for catering cleaning and security and 30 out of the 65 libaid staff were essentially ghost employees who showed up on the payroll sight unseen the u n center was a treasure trove the senior libaid official lamented there was no way you could operate while being surrounded by tripoli militias it was a big gamble advertising an internal u n communication from early 2019 shows it was aware of the problem the note found a high risk that food for the u n center was being diverted to militias given the amount budgeted compared to the amount migrants were eating in general around 50 dinars a day or 35 is budgeted per detainee for food and other essentials for all centers according to two libyan officials two owners of food catering companies and an international aid worker of that only around 2 dinars is actually spent on meals according to their rough calculations and migrants descriptions despite the investigations into al khoja tarik al sikka and another detention center shared a 996 000 euro grant from the eu and italy in february at the zawiya center emergency goods delivered by u n agencies ended up redistributed half for the prisoners half for the workers said orobosa bright a nigerian who endured three stints there for a total of 11 months many of the goods end up on libya s black market as well libyan officials and international aid workers say iom s spokeswoman said aid diversion is a reality in libya and beyond and that the agency does its best msehli said if it happens regularly iom will be forced to re evaluate its supports to detention centers despite our awareness that any reduction in this lifesaving assistance will add to the misery of migrants despite the corruption the detention system in libya is still expanding in places with money from europe at a detention center in sabaa where migrants are already going hungry they were forced to build yet another wing funded by the italian government said lamloum the libyan aid worker the italian government did not respond to a request for comment advertising lamloum sent a photo of the new prison it has no windows tunisia laundering the money earned off the suffering of migrants is whitewashed in money laundering operations in tunisia libya s neighbor in the town of ben gardane dozens of money changing stalls transform libyan dinars dollars and euros into tunisian currency before the money continues on its way to the capital tunis even libyans without residency can open a bank account tunisia also offers another opportunity for militia networks to make money off european funds earmarked for migrants because of libya s dysfunctional banking system where cash is scarce and militias control accounts international organizations give contracts usually in dollars to libyan organizations with bank accounts in tunisia the vendors compound the money on libya s black market exchange which ranges between 4 and 9 times greater than the official rate libya s government handed over more than 100 files to tunisia earlier this year listing companies under investigation for fraud and money laundering the companies largely involve militia warlords and politicians according to nadia saadi a manager at the tunisian anti corruption authority the laundering involves cash payments for real estate falsified customs documents and faked bills for fictitious companies all in all libya is run by militias said a senior libyan judicial official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of risking his life whatever governments say and whatever uniform they wear or stickers they put this is the bottom line husni bey a prominent businessman in libya said the idea of europe sending aid money to libya a once wealthy country suffering from corruption was ill conceived from the beginning europe wants to buy those who can stop smuggling with all of these programs bey said they would be much better off blacklisting the names of those involved in human trafficking fuel and drug smuggling and charging them with crimes instead of giving them money ___

n agencies the ap found that in a country without a functioning government huge sums of european money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants in some cases u n officials knew militia networks were getting the money according to internal emails the militias torture extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the u n often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers sold to traffickers or to other centers the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the u n to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in u n food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other u n teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials in many cases the money goes to neighboring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention center she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by u n staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the center she could not say who got the money she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention center where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal u n emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the u n s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a u n brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centers a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the u n say they want the centers closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the u n to spend the money wisely the u n said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the u n refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centers about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak u n backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention center named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the u n migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under u n sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to u n aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs center twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the center and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention center the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the center which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarik al sikka a detention center in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a center an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labor hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms center acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the center closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs center said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs center which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the u n and the eu the iom highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the u n s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact u n staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a u n sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither center responded to requests for comment the u n s international organization for migration acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said iom spokeswoman safa msehli failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men women and children the story of abdullah a sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is all told the group of 47 in his first crossing from tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed libyan and his cronies 127 000 in a mix of dollars euros and libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention center and cross in two boats they were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed libyan shaken down for their cell phones and more money and tossed back into detention we talked to him and asked him why did you let us out and then arrest us said abdullah who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation he beat two of us who brought it up abdullah later ended up in the al nasr martyrs detention center where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality ethiopians 5 000 somalis 6 800 moroccans and egyptians 8 100 and finally bangladeshis a minimum 18 500 across the board women pay more abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee last july he and 18 others paid 48 000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours after a few days stuck at sea off the libyan coast under a sweltering sun they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end instead they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by tunisian fishermen who took them back to tunisia there are only three ways out of the prison you escape you pay ransom or you die abdullah said referring to the detention center in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centers and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the eu wants them to prevent letting migrants cross according to tarik lamloum the head of the libyan human rights organization beladi traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around 10 000 per boat that is allowed to pass with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favorable he said the head of libya s department for combating irregular migration or dcim the agency responsible for the detention centers under the ministry of interior acknowledged corruption and collusion among the militias and the coast guard and traffickers and even within the government itself they are in bed with them as well as people from my own agency said al mabrouk abdel hafez skimming profits beyond the direct abuse of migrants the militia network also profits by siphoning off money from eu funds sent for their food and security even those earmarked for a u n run migrant center according to more than a dozen officials and aid workers in libya and tunisia as well as internal u n emails and meeting minutes seen by the associated press an audit in may of the unhcr the u n refugee agency responsible for the center found a lack of oversight and accountability at nearly all levels of spending in the libya mission the audit identified inexplicable payments in american dollars to libyan firms and deliveries of goods that were never verified in december 2018 during the period reviewed in the audit the u n launched its migrant center in tripoli known as the gathering and departure facility or gdf as an alternative to detention for the recipients of the services contracts sent through the libyan government agency libaid it was a windfall millions of euros in contracts for food and migrant aid went to at least one company linked to al khoja the militia leader flown to rome for the u n migration meeting according to internal u n emails seen by the ap two senior libyan officials and an international aid worker al khoja is also the deputy head of the dcim the government agency responsible for the detention centers one of the libyan officials saw the multimillion euro catering contract with a company named ard al watan or the land of the nation which al khoja controls we feel like this is al khoja s fiefdom he controls everything he shuts the doors and he opens the doors said the official a former employee at the u n center who like other libyan officials spoke anonymously out of fear for his safety he said al khoja used sections of the u n center to train his militia fighters and built a luxury apartment inside even as the contracts for the u n center were negotiated libyan officials said three libyan government agencies were investigating al khoja in connection with the disappearance of 570 million from government spending allocated to feed migrants in detention centers in the west at the time al khoja already ran another center for migrants tarik al sikka notorious for abuses including beating hard labor and a massive ransom scheme tekila an eritrean refugee said that for two years at tarik al sikka he and other migrants lived on macaroni even after he was among 25 people who came down with tuberculosis a disease exacerbated by malnutrition tekila asked that only his first name be used for his safety when there is little food there is no choice but to go to sleep he said despite internal u n emails warning of severe malnutrition inside tarik al sikka u n officials in february and march 2018 repeatedly visited the detention center to negotiate the future opening of the gdf ap saw emails confirming that by july 2018 the unhcr s chief of mission was notified that companies controlled by al khoja s militia would receive subcontracts for services yaxley the spokesman for unhcr emphasized that the officials the agency works with are all under the authority of the ministry of interior he said unhcr monitors expenses to make sure its standard rules are followed and may withhold payments otherwise a senior official at libaid the libyan government agency that managed the center with the u n said the contracts are worth at least 7 million for catering cleaning and security and 30 out of the 65 libaid staff were essentially ghost employees who showed up on the payroll sight unseen the u n center was a treasure trove the senior libaid official lamented there was no way you could operate while being surrounded by tripoli militias it was a big gamble an internal u n communication from early 2019 shows it was aware of the problem the note found a high risk that food for the u n center was being diverted to militias given the amount budgeted compared to the amount migrants were eating in general around 50 dinars a day or 35 is budgeted per detainee for food and other essentials for all centers according to two libyan officials two owners of food catering companies and an international aid worker of that only around 2 dinars is actually spent on meals according to their rough calculations and migrants descriptions despite the investigations into al khoja tarik al sikka and another detention center shared a 996 000 euro grant from the eu and italy in february at the zawiya center emergency goods delivered by u n agencies ended up redistributed half for the prisoners half for the workers said orobosa bright a nigerian who endured three stints there for a total of 11 months many of the goods end up on libya s black market as well libyan officials and international aid workers say iom s spokeswoman said aid diversion is a reality in libya and beyond and that the agency does its best msehli said if it happens regularly iom will be forced to re evaluate its supports to detention centers despite our awareness that any reduction in this lifesaving assistance will add to the misery of migrants despite the corruption the detention system in libya is still expanding in places with money from europe at a detention center in sabaa where migrants are already going hungry they were forced to build yet another wing funded by the italian government said lamloum the libyan aid worker the italian government did not respond to a request for comment lamloum sent a photo of the new prison it has no windows tunisia laundering the money earned off the suffering of migrants is whitewashed in money laundering operations in tunisia libya s neighbor in the town of ben gardane dozens of money changing stalls transform libyan dinars dollars and euros into tunisian currency before the money continues on its way to the capital tunis even libyans without residency can open a bank account tunisia also offers another opportunity for militia networks to make money off european funds earmarked for migrants because of libya s dysfunctional banking system where cash is scarce and militias control accounts international organizations give contracts usually in dollars to libyan organizations with bank accounts in tunisia the vendors compound the money on libya s black market exchange which ranges between 4 and 9 times greater than the official rate libya s government handed over more than 100 files to tunisia earlier this year listing companies under investigation for fraud and money laundering the companies largely involve militia warlords and politicians according to nadia saadi a manager at the tunisian anti corruption authority the laundering involves cash payments for real estate falsified customs documents and faked bills for fictitious companies all in all libya is run by militias said a senior libyan judicial official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of risking his life whatever governments say and whatever uniform they wear or stickers they put this is the bottom line husni bey a prominent businessman in libya said the idea of europe sending aid money to libya a once wealthy country suffering from corruption was ill conceived from the beginning europe wants to buy those who can stop smuggling with all of these programs bey said they would be much better off blacklisting the names of those involved in human trafficking fuel and drug smuggling and charging them with crimes instead of giving them money ___

detention centre in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centres and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by

reading or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story tripoli libya ap when the european union started funneling millions of euros into libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the mediterranean the money came with eu promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking that hasn t happened instead the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found the eu has sent more than 327 9 million euros to libya with an additional 41 million approved in early december largely channeled through u n agencies the ap found that in a country without a functioning government huge sums of european money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants in some cases u n officials knew militia networks were getting the money according to internal emails the militias torture extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the u n often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers sold to traffickers or to other centers the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the u n to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in u n food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other u n teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials in many cases the money goes to neighboring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention center she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by u n staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the center she could not say who got the money she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention center where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal u n emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the u n s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a u n brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centers a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the u n say they want the centers closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the u n to spend the money wisely the u n said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the u n refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centers about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak u n backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention center named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the u n migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under u n sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to u n aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs center twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the center and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention center the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the center which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarik al sikka a detention center in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a center an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labor hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms center acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the center closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs center said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs center which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the u n and the eu the iom highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the u n s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact u n staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a u n sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along

centers under the nose of the u n often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers sold to traffickers or to other centers the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the u n to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in u n food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other u n teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials in many cases the money goes to neighboring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention center she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by u n staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the center she could not say who got the money she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention center where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal u n emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the u n s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a u n brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centers a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the u n say they want the centers closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the u n to spend the money wisely the u n said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the u n refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centers about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak u n backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention center named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the u n migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under u n sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to u n aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs center twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the center and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention center the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the center which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarik al sikka a detention center in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a center an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labor hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms center acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the center closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs center said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs center which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the u n and the eu the iom highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the u n s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact u n staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a u n sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither center responded to requests for comment the u n s international organization for migration acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said iom spokeswoman safa msehli failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men women and children the story of abdullah a sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is all told the group of 47 in his first crossing from tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed libyan and his cronies 127 000 in a mix of dollars euros and libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention center and cross in two boats they were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed libyan shaken down for their cell phones and more money and tossed back into detention we talked to him and asked him why did you let us out and then arrest us said abdullah who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation he beat two of us who brought it up abdullah later ended up in the al nasr martyrs detention center where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality ethiopians 5 000 somalis 6 800 moroccans and egyptians 8 100 and finally bangladeshis a minimum 18 500 across the board women pay more abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee last july he and 18 others paid 48 000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours after a few days stuck at sea off the libyan coast under a sweltering sun they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end instead they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by tunisian fishermen who took them back to tunisia there are only three ways out of the prison you escape you pay ransom or you die abdullah said referring to the detention center in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centers and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the eu wants them to prevent letting migrants cross according to tarik lamloum the head of the libyan human rights organization beladi traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around 10 000 per boat that is allowed to pass with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favorable he said the head of libya s department for combating irregular migration or dcim the agency responsible for the detention centers under the ministry of interior acknowledged corruption and collusion among the militias and the coast guard and traffickers and even within the government itself they are in bed with them as well as people from my own agency said al mabrouk abdel hafez skimming profits beyond the direct abuse of migrants the militia network also profits by siphoning off money from eu funds sent for their food and security even those earmarked for a u n run migrant center according to more than a dozen officials and aid workers in libya and tunisia as well as internal u n emails and meeting minutes seen by the associated press an audit in may of the unhcr the u n refugee agency responsible for the center found a lack of oversight and accountability at nearly all levels of spending in the libya mission the audit identified inexplicable payments in american dollars to libyan firms and deliveries of goods that were never verified in december 2018 during the period reviewed in the audit the u n launched its migrant center in tripoli known as the gathering and departure facility or gdf as an alternative to detention for the recipients of the services contracts sent through the libyan government agency libaid it was a windfall millions of euros in contracts for food and migrant aid went to at least one company linked to al khoja the militia leader flown to rome for the u n migration meeting according to internal u n emails seen by the ap two senior libyan officials and an international aid worker al khoja is also the deputy head of the dcim the government agency responsible for the detention centers one of the libyan officials saw the multimillion euro catering contract with a company named ard al watan or the land of the nation which al khoja controls we feel like this is al khoja s fiefdom he controls everything he shuts the doors and he opens the doors said the official a former employee at the u n center who like other libyan officials spoke anonymously out of fear for his safety he said al khoja used sections of the u n center to train his militia fighters and built a luxury apartment inside even as the contracts for the u n center were negotiated libyan officials said three libyan government agencies were investigating al khoja in connection with the disappearance of 570 million from government spending allocated to feed migrants in detention centers in the west at the time al khoja already ran another center for migrants tarik al sikka notorious for abuses including beating hard labor and a massive ransom scheme tekila an eritrean refugee said that for two years at tarik al sikka he and other migrants lived on macaroni even after he was among 25 people who came down with tuberculosis a disease exacerbated by malnutrition tekila asked that only his first name be used for his safety when there is little food there is no choice but to go to sleep he said despite internal u n emails warning of severe malnutrition inside tarik al sikka u n officials in february and march 2018 repeatedly visited the detention center to negotiate the future opening of the gdf ap saw emails confirming that by july 2018 the unhcr s chief of mission was notified that companies controlled by al khoja s militia would receive subcontracts for services yaxley the spokesman for unhcr emphasized that the officials the agency works with are all under the authority of the ministry of interior he said unhcr monitors expenses to make sure its standard rules are followed and may withhold payments otherwise a senior official at libaid the libyan government agency that managed the center with the u n said the contracts are worth at least 7 million for catering cleaning and security and 30 out of the 65 libaid staff were essentially ghost employees who showed up on the payroll sight unseen the u n center was a treasure trove the senior libaid official lamented there was no way you could operate while being surrounded by tripoli militias it was a big gamble an internal u n communication from early 2019 shows it was aware of the problem the note found a high risk that food for the u n center was being diverted to militias given the amount budgeted compared to the amount migrants were eating in general around 50 dinars a day or 35 is budgeted per detainee for food and other essentials for all centers according to two libyan officials two owners of food catering companies and an international aid worker of that only around 2 dinars is actually spent on meals according to their rough calculations and migrants descriptions despite the investigations into al khoja tarik al sikka and another detention center shared a 996 000 euro grant from the eu and italy in february at the zawiya center emergency goods delivered by u n agencies ended up redistributed half for the prisoners half for the workers said orobosa bright a nigerian who endured three stints there for a total of 11 months many of the goods end up on libya s black market as well libyan officials and international aid workers say iom s spokeswoman said aid diversion is a reality in libya and beyond and that the agency does its best msehli said if it happens regularly iom will be forced to re evaluate its supports to detention centers despite our awareness that any reduction in this lifesaving assistance will add to the misery of migrants despite the corruption the detention system in libya is still expanding in places with money from europe at a detention center in sabaa where migrants are already going hungry they were forced to build yet another wing funded by the italian government said lamloum the libyan aid worker the italian government did not respond to a request for comment lamloum sent a photo of the new prison it has no windows tunisia laundering the money earned off the suffering of migrants is whitewashed in money laundering operations in tunisia libya s neighbor in the town of ben gardane dozens of money changing stalls transform libyan dinars dollars and euros into tunisian currency before the money continues on its way to the capital tunis even libyans without residency can open a bank account tunisia also offers another opportunity for militia networks to make money off european funds earmarked for migrants because of libya s dysfunctional banking system where cash is scarce and militias control accounts international organizations give contracts usually in dollars to libyan organizations with bank accounts in tunisia the vendors compound the money on libya s black market exchange which ranges between 4 and 9 times greater than the official rate libya s government handed over more than 100 files to tunisia earlier this year listing companies under investigation for fraud and money laundering the companies largely involve militia warlords and politicians according to nadia saadi a manager at the tunisian anti corruption authority the laundering involves cash payments for real estate falsified customs documents and faked bills for fictitious companies all in all libya is run by militias said a senior libyan judicial official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of risking his life whatever governments say and whatever uniform they wear or stickers they put this is the bottom line husni bey a prominent businessman in libya said the idea of europe sending aid money to libya a once wealthy country suffering from corruption was ill conceived from the beginning europe wants to buy those who can stop smuggling with all of these programs bey said they would be much better off blacklisting the names of those involved in human trafficking fuel and drug smuggling and charging them with crimes instead of giving them money ___

sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is all told the group of 47 in his first crossing from tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed libyan and his cronies 127 000 in a mix of dollars euros and libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention center and cross in two boats they were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed libyan shaken down for their cell phones and more money and tossed back into detention we talked to him and asked him why did you let us out and then arrest us said abdullah who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation he beat two of us who brought it up abdullah later ended up in the al nasr martyrs detention center where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality ethiopians 5 000 somalis 6 800 moroccans and egyptians 8 100 and finally bangladeshis a minimum 18 500 across the board women pay more abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee last july he and 18 others paid 48 000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours after a few days stuck at sea off the libyan coast under a sweltering sun they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end instead they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by tunisian fishermen who took them back to tunisia there are only three ways out of the prison you escape you pay ransom or you die abdullah said referring to the detention center in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centers and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the eu wants them to prevent letting migrants cross according to tarik lamloum the head of the libyan human rights organization beladi traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around 10 000 per boat that is allowed to pass with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favorable he said the head of libya s department for combating irregular migration

other libyan officials spoke anonymously out of fear for his safety he said al khoja used sections of the u n center to train his militia fighters and built a luxury apartment inside even as the contracts for the u n center were negotiated libyan officials said three libyan government agencies were investigating al khoja in connection with the disappearance of 570 million from government spending allocated to feed migrants in detention centers in the west at the time al khoja already ran another center for migrants tarik al sikka notorious for abuses including beating hard labor and a massive ransom scheme tekila an eritrean refugee said that for two years at tarik al sikka he and other migrants lived on macaroni even after he was among 25 people who came down with tuberculosis a

operate while being surrounded by tripoli militias it was a big gamble an internal u n communication from early 2019 shows it was aware of the problem the note found a high risk that food for the u n center was being diverted to militias given the amount budgeted compared to the amount migrants were eating in general around 50 dinars a day or 35 is budgeted per detainee for food and other

european money spawns more misery for migrants in libya mosa ab elshamy ap tripoli libya when the european union started funneling millions of euros into libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the mediterranean the money came with eu promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking that hasn t happened instead the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found the eu has sent more than 327 9 million euros to libya with an additional 41 million approved in early december largely funneled through un agencies the ap found that in a country without a functioning government huge sums of european money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants in some cases un officials knew militia networks were getting the money according to internal emails the militias torture extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the un often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers sold to traffickers or to other centers the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the un to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in un food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other un teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials in many cases the money goes to neighboring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention center she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by un staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the center she could not say who got the money she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention center where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal un emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the un s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a un brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centers a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the un say they want the centers closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the un to spend the money wisely the un said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the un refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centers about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak un backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention center named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the un s migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under un sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to un aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs center twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the center and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention center the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the center which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarek al sikka a detention center in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a center an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labor hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms center acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the center closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs center said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs center which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the un and the eu the iom the un s agency for migration highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the un s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact un staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a un sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither center responded to requests for comment the iom the un migration agency acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said safa msehli the spokeswoman for the un s international organization for migration

libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal u n emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the u n s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a u n brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centres a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the u n say they want the centres closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centres libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centres uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the u n to spend the money wisely the u n said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centres to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the u n refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centres about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centres at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak u n backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention centre named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the u n migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the centre are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the centre according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under u n sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to u n aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs centre twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the centre and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention centre the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the centre which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarik al sikka a detention centre in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a centre an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centres profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labour hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centres had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention centre or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms centre acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the centre i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the centre closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs centre said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the centre s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs centre which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centres they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the u n and the eu the iom highlights its co operation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centres the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the u n s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact u n staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a u n sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither centre responded to requests for comment the u n s international organization for migration acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said iom spokeswoman safa msehli failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men women and children the story of abdullah a sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is all told the group of 47 in his first crossing from tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed libyan and his cronies 127 000 in a mix of dollars euros and libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention centre and cross in two boats they were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed libyan shaken down for their cellphones and more money and tossed back into detention we talked to him and asked him why did you let us out and then arrest us said abdullah who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation he beat two of us who brought it up abdullah later ended up in the al nasr martyrs detention centre where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality ethiopians 5 000 somalis 6 800 moroccans and egyptians 8 100 and finally bangladeshis a minimum 18 500 across the board women pay more abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee last july he and 18 others paid 48 000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours after a few days stuck at sea off the libyan coast under a sweltering sun they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end instead they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by tunisian fishermen who took them back to tunisia there are only three ways out of the prison you escape you pay ransom or you die abdullah said referring to the detention centre in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centres and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the eu wants them to prevent letting migrants cross according to tarik lamloum the head of the libyan human rights organization beladi traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around 10 000 per boat that is allowed to pass with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favourable he said the head of libya s department for combating irregular migration or dcim the agency responsible for the detention centres under the ministry of interior acknowledged corruption and collusion among the militias and the coast guard and traffickers and even within the government itself they are in bed with them as well as people from my own agency said al mabrouk abdel hafez skimming profits beyond the direct abuse of migrants the militia network also profits by siphoning off money from eu funds sent for their food and security even those earmarked for a u n run migrant centre according to more than a dozen officials and aid workers in libya and tunisia as well as internal u n emails and meeting minutes seen by the associated press an audit in may of the unhcr the u n refugee agency responsible for the centre found a lack of oversight and accountability at nearly all levels of spending in the libya mission the audit identified inexplicable payments in american dollars to libyan firms and deliveries of goods that were never verified in december 2018 during the period reviewed in the audit the u n launched its migrant centre in tripoli known as the gathering and departure facility or gdf as an alternative to detention for the recipients of the services contracts sent through the libyan government agency libaid it was a windfall millions of euros in contracts for food and migrant aid went to at least one company linked to al khoja the militia leader flown to rome for the u n migration meeting according to internal u n emails seen by the ap two senior libyan officials and an international aid worker al khoja is also the deputy head of the dcim the government agency responsible for the detention centres one of the libyan officials saw the multimillion euro catering contract with a company named ard al watan or the land of the nation which al khoja controls we feel like this is al khoja s fiefdom he controls everything he shuts the doors and he opens the doors said the official a former employee at the u n centre who like other libyan officials spoke anonymously out of fear for his safety he said al khoja used sections of the u n centre to train his militia fighters and built a luxury apartment inside even as the contracts for the u n centre were negotiated libyan officials said three libyan government agencies were investigating al khoja in connection with the disappearance of 570 million from government spending allocated to feed migrants in detention centres in the west at the time al khoja already ran another centre for migrants tarik al sikka notorious for abuses including beating hard labour and a massive ransom scheme tekila an eritrean refugee said that for two years at tarik al sikka he and other migrants lived on macaroni even after he was among 25 people who came down with tuberculosis a disease exacerbated by malnutrition tekila asked that only his first name be used for his safety when there is little food there is no choice but to go to sleep he said despite internal u n emails warning of severe malnutrition inside tarik al sikka u n officials in february and march 2018 repeatedly visited the detention centre to negotiate the future opening of the gdf ap saw emails confirming that by july 2018 the unhcr s chief of mission was notified that companies controlled by al khoja s militia would receive subcontracts for services yaxley the spokesman for unhcr emphasized that the officials the agency works with are all under the authority of the ministry of interior he said unhcr monitors expenses to make sure its standard rules are followed and may withhold payments otherwise a senior official at libaid the libyan government agency that managed the centre with the u n said the contracts are worth at least 7 million for catering cleaning and security and 30 out of the 65 libaid staff were essentially ghost employees who showed up on the payroll sight unseen the u n centre was a treasure trove the senior libaid official lamented there was no way you could operate while being surrounded by tripoli militias it was a big gamble an internal u n communication from early 2019 shows it was aware of the problem the note found a high risk that food for the u n centre was being diverted to militias given the amount budgeted compared to the amount migrants were eating in general around 50 dinars a day or 35 is budgeted per detainee for food and other essentials for all centres according to two libyan officials two owners of food catering companies and an international aid worker of that only around 2 dinars is actually spent on meals according to their rough calculations and migrants descriptions despite the investigations into al khoja tarik al sikka and another detention centre shared a 996 000 euro grant from the eu and italy in february at the zawiya centre emergency goods delivered by u n agencies ended up redistributed half for the prisoners half for the workers said orobosa bright a nigerian who endured three stints there for a total of 11 months many of the goods end up on libya s black market as well libyan officials and international aid workers say iom s spokeswoman said aid diversion is a reality in libya and beyond and that the agency does its best msehli said if it happens regularly iom will be forced to re evaluate its supports to detention centres despite our awareness that any reduction in this lifesaving assistance will add to the misery of migrants despite the corruption the detention system in libya is still expanding in places with money from europe at a detention centre in sabaa where migrants are already going hungry they were forced to build yet another wing funded by the italian government said lamloum the libyan aid worker the italian government did not respond to a request for comment lamloum sent a photo of the new prison it has no windows tunisia laundering the money earned off the suffering of migrants is whitewashed in money laundering operations in tunisia libya s neighbour in the town of ben gardane dozens of money changing stalls transform libyan dinars dollars and euros into tunisian currency before the money continues on its way to the capital tunis even libyans without residency can open a bank account tunisia also offers another opportunity for militia networks to make money off european funds earmarked for migrants because of libya s dysfunctional banking system where cash is scarce and militias control accounts international organizations give contracts usually in dollars to libyan organizations with bank accounts in tunisia the vendors compound the money on libya s black market exchange which ranges between 4 and 9 times greater than the official rate libya s government handed over more than 100 files to tunisia earlier this year listing companies under investigation for fraud and money laundering the companies largely involve militia warlords and politicians according to nadia saadi a manager at the tunisian anti corruption authority the laundering involves cash payments for real estate falsified customs documents and faked bills for fictitious companies all in all libya is run by militias said a senior libyan judicial official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of risking his life whatever governments say and whatever uniform they wear or stickers they put this is the bottom line husni bey a prominent businessman in libya said the idea of europe sending aid money to libya a once wealthy country suffering from corruption was ill conceived from the beginning europe wants to buy those who can stop smuggling with all of these programs bey said they would be much better off blacklisting the names of those involved in human trafficking fuel and drug smuggling and charging them with crimes instead of giving them money ___ michael reported from tripoli libya hinnant

in this sept 23 2019 photo rescued migrants look at a map of europe aboard the ocean viking humanitarian ship as it sails in the mediterranean sea the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative business in part funded by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found ap photo renata brito tripoli when the european union started funneling millions of euros into libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the mediterranean the money came with eu promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking that hasn t happened instead the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found recommended videos the eu has sent more than 327 9 million euros to libya with an additional 41 million approved in early december largely channeled through u n agencies the ap found that in a country without a functioning government huge sums of european money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants in some cases u n officials knew militia networks were getting the money according to internal emails the militias torture extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the u n often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers sold to traffickers or to other centers the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the u n to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in u n food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other u n teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials in many cases the money goes to neighboring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention center she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by u n staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the center she could not say who got the money she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another

tripoli libya ap when the european union started funneling millions of euros into libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the mediterranean the money came with eu promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking that hasn t happened instead the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found the eu has sent more than 327 9 million euros to libya with an additional 41 million approved in early december largely channeled through u n agencies the ap found that in a country without a functioning government huge sums of european money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants in some cases u n officials knew militia networks were getting the money according to internal emails the militias torture extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the u n often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers sold to traffickers or to other centers the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the u n to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in u n food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other u n teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials in many cases the money goes to neighboring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention center she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by u n staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the center she could not say who got the money she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention center where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal u n emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the u n s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a u n brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centers a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the u n say they want the centers closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the u n to spend the money wisely the u n said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the u n refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centers about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak u n backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention center named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the u n migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under u n sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to u n aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs center twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the center and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention center the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the center which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarik al sikka a detention center in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a center an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labor hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms center acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the center closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs center said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs center which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the u n and the eu the iom highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the u n s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact u n staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a u n sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither center responded to requests for comment the u n s international organization for migration acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said iom spokeswoman safa msehli failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men women and children the story of abdullah a sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is all told the group of 47 in his first crossing from tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed libyan and his cronies 127 000 in a mix of dollars euros and libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention center and cross in two boats they were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed libyan shaken down for their cell phones and more money and tossed back into detention we talked to him and asked him why did you let us out and then arrest us said abdullah who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation he beat two of us who brought it up abdullah later ended up in the al nasr martyrs detention center where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality ethiopians 5 000 somalis 6 800 moroccans and egyptians 8 100 and finally bangladeshis a minimum 18 500 across the board women pay more abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee last july he and 18 others paid 48 000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours after a few days stuck at sea off the libyan coast under a sweltering sun they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end instead they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by tunisian fishermen who took them back to tunisia there are only three ways out of the prison you escape you pay ransom or you die abdullah said referring to the detention center in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centers and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the eu wants them to prevent letting migrants cross according to tarik lamloum the head of the libyan human rights organization beladi traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around 10 000 per boat that is allowed to pass with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favorable he said the head of libya s department for combating irregular migration

detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the u n refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centers about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak u n backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention center named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the u n migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under u n sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to u n aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs center twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the center and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention center the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the center which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarik al sikka a detention center in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a center an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labor hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms center acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the center closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs center said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs center which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the u n and the eu the iom highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the u n s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact u n staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a u n sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither center responded to requests for comment the u n s international organization for migration acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said iom spokeswoman safa msehli failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men women and children the story of abdullah a sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is all told the group of 47 in his first crossing from tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed libyan and his cronies 127 000 in a mix of dollars euros and libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention center and cross in two boats they were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed libyan shaken down for their cell phones and more money and tossed back into detention we talked to him and asked him why did you let us out and then arrest us said abdullah who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation he beat two of us who brought it up abdullah later ended up in the al nasr martyrs detention center where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality ethiopians 5 000 somalis 6 800 moroccans and egyptians 8 100 and finally bangladeshis a minimum 18 500 across the board women pay more abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee last july he and 18 others paid 48 000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours after a few days stuck at sea off the libyan coast under a sweltering sun they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end instead they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by tunisian fishermen who took them back to tunisia there are only three ways out of the prison you escape you pay ransom or you die abdullah said referring to the detention center in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centers and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the eu wants them to prevent letting migrants cross according to tarik lamloum the head of the libyan human rights organization beladi traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around 10 000 per boat that is allowed to pass with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favorable he said the head of libya s department for combating irregular migration or dcim the agency responsible for the detention centers under the ministry of interior acknowledged corruption and collusion among the militias and the coast guard and traffickers and even within the government itself they are in bed with them as well as people from my own agency said al mabrouk abdel hafez skimming profits beyond the direct abuse of migrants the militia network also profits by siphoning off money from eu funds sent for their food and security even those earmarked for a u n run migrant center according to more than a dozen officials and aid workers in libya and tunisia as well as internal u n emails and meeting minutes seen by the associated press an audit in may of the unhcr the u n refugee agency responsible for the center found a lack of oversight and accountability at nearly all levels of spending in the libya mission the audit identified inexplicable payments in american dollars to libyan firms and deliveries of goods that were never verified in december 2018 during the period reviewed in the audit the u n launched its migrant center in tripoli known as the gathering and departure facility or gdf as an alternative to detention for the recipients of the services contracts sent through the libyan government agency libaid it was a windfall millions of euros in contracts for food and migrant aid went to at least one company linked to al khoja the militia leader flown to rome for the u n migration meeting according to internal u n emails seen by the ap two senior libyan officials and an international aid worker al khoja is also the deputy head of the dcim the government agency responsible for the detention centers one of the libyan officials saw the multimillion euro catering contract with a company named ard al watan or the land of the nation which al khoja controls we feel like this is al khoja s fiefdom he controls everything he shuts the doors and he opens the doors said the official a former employee at the u n center who like other libyan officials spoke anonymously out of fear for his safety he said al khoja used sections of the u n center to train his militia fighters and built a luxury apartment inside even as the contracts for the u n center were negotiated libyan officials said three libyan government agencies were investigating al khoja in connection with the disappearance of 570 million from government spending allocated to feed migrants in detention centers in the west at the time al khoja already ran another center for migrants tarik al sikka notorious for abuses including beating hard labor and a massive ransom scheme tekila an eritrean refugee said that for two years at tarik al sikka he and other migrants lived on macaroni even after he was among 25 people who came down with tuberculosis a disease exacerbated by malnutrition tekila asked that only his first name be used for his safety when there is little food there is no choice but to go to sleep he said despite internal u n emails warning of severe malnutrition inside tarik al sikka u n officials in february and march 2018 repeatedly visited the detention center to negotiate the future opening of the gdf ap saw emails confirming that by july 2018 the unhcr s chief of mission was notified that companies controlled by al khoja s militia would receive subcontracts for services yaxley the spokesman for unhcr emphasized that the officials the agency works with are all under the authority of the ministry of interior he said unhcr monitors expenses to make sure its standard rules are followed and may withhold payments otherwise a senior official at libaid the libyan government agency that managed the center with the u n said the contracts are worth at least 7 million for catering cleaning and security and 30 out of the 65 libaid staff were essentially ghost employees who showed up on the payroll sight unseen the u n center was a treasure trove the senior libaid official lamented there was no way you could operate while being surrounded by tripoli militias it was a big gamble an internal u n communication from early 2019 shows it was aware of the problem the note found a high risk that food for the u n center was being diverted to militias given the amount budgeted compared to the amount migrants were eating in general around 50 dinars a day or 35 is budgeted per detainee for food and other essentials for all centers according to two libyan officials two owners of food catering companies and an international aid worker of that only around 2 dinars is actually spent on meals according to their rough calculations and migrants descriptions despite the investigations into al khoja tarik al sikka and another detention center shared a 996 000 euro grant from the eu and italy in february at the zawiya center emergency goods delivered by u n agencies ended up redistributed half for the prisoners half for the workers said orobosa bright a nigerian who endured three stints there for a total of 11 months many of the goods end up on libya s black market as well libyan officials and international aid workers say iom s spokeswoman said aid diversion is a reality in libya and beyond and that the agency does its best msehli said if it happens regularly iom will be forced to re evaluate its supports to detention centers despite our awareness that any reduction in this lifesaving assistance will add to the misery of migrants despite the corruption the detention system in libya is still expanding in places with money from europe at a detention center in sabaa where migrants are already going hungry they were forced to build yet another wing funded by the italian government said lamloum the libyan aid worker the italian government did not respond to a request for comment lamloum sent a photo of the new prison it has no windows tunisia laundering the money earned off the suffering of migrants is whitewashed in money laundering operations in tunisia libya s neighbor in the town of ben gardane dozens of money changing stalls transform libyan dinars dollars and euros into tunisian currency before the money continues on its way to the capital tunis even libyans without residency can open a bank account tunisia also offers another opportunity for militia networks to make money off european funds earmarked for migrants because of libya s dysfunctional banking system where cash is scarce and militias control accounts international organizations give contracts usually in dollars to libyan organizations with bank accounts in tunisia the vendors compound the money on libya s black market exchange which ranges between 4 and 9 times greater than the official rate libya s government handed over more than 100 files to tunisia earlier this year listing companies under investigation for fraud and money laundering the companies largely involve militia warlords and politicians according to nadia saadi a manager at the tunisian anti corruption authority the laundering involves cash payments for real estate falsified customs documents and faked bills for fictitious companies all in all libya is run by militias said a senior libyan judicial official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of risking his life whatever governments say and whatever uniform they wear or stickers they put this is the bottom line husni bey a prominent businessman in libya said the idea of europe sending aid money to libya a once wealthy country suffering from corruption was ill conceived from the beginning europe wants to buy those who can stop smuggling with all of these programs bey said they would be much better off blacklisting the names of those involved in human trafficking fuel and drug smuggling and charging them with crimes instead of giving them money ___

reading or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story tripoli libya ap when the european union started funneling millions of euros into libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the mediterranean the money came with eu promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking that hasn t happened instead the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found the eu has sent more than 327 9 million euros to libya with an additional 41 million approved in early december largely channeled through u n agencies the ap found that in a country without a functioning government huge sums of european money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants in some cases u n officials knew militia networks were getting the money according to internal emails the militias torture extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the u n often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers sold to traffickers or to other centers the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the u n to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in u n food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other u n teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials in many cases the money goes to neighboring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention center she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by u n staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the center she could not say who got the money she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention center where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal u n emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the u n s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a u n brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centers a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the u n say they want the centers closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the u n to spend the

opportunity for militia networks to make money off european funds earmarked for migrants because of libya s dysfunctional banking system where cash is scarce and militias control accounts international organizations give contracts usually in dollars to libyan organizations with bank accounts in tunisia the vendors compound the money on libya s black market exchange which ranges between 4 and 9 times greater than the official rate libya s government handed over more than 100 files to tunisia earlier this year listing companies under investigation for fraud and money laundering the

when the european union started funneling millions of euros into libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the mediterranean the money came with eu promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking that hasn t happened instead the misery of migrants in libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the eu and enabled by the united nations an associated press investigation has found the eu has sent more than 327 9 million euros to libya with an additional 41 million approved in early december largely funneled through un agencies the ap found that in a country without a functioning government huge sums of european money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants in some cases un officials knew militia networks were getting the money according to internal emails the militias torture extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the un often in compounds that receive millions in european money the ap investigation showed many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers sold to traffickers or to other centers the same militias conspire with some members of libyan coast guard units the coast guard gets training and equipment from europe to keep migrants away from its shores but coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias the ap found and receive bribes to let others pass en route to europe the militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off european funds given through the un to feed and otherwise help migrants who go hungry for example millions of euros in un food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader even as other un teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center according to emails obtained by the ap and interviews with at least a half dozen libyan officials in many cases the money goes to neighboring tunisia to be laundered and then flows back to the militias in libya ___ this story is part of an occasional series outsourcing migrants produced with the support of the pulitzer center on crisis reporting ___ the story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention center she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by un staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the center she could not say who got the money she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention center where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal un emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the un s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a un brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centers a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the un say they want the centers closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the un to spend the money wisely the un said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the un refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centers about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak un backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention center named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the un s migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under un sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to un aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs center twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the center and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention center the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the center which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarek al sikka a detention center in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a center an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labor hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms center acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the center closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs center said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs center which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the un and the eu the iom the un s agency for migration highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the un s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact un staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a un sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither center responded to requests for comment the iom the un migration agency acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said safa msehli the spokeswoman for the un s international organization for migration failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men women and children the story of abdullah a sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is all told the group of 47 in his first crossing from tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed libyan and his cronies 127 000 in a mix of dollars euros and libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention center and cross in two boats they were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed libyan shaken down for their cell phones and more money and tossed back into detention we talked to him and asked him why did you let us out and then arrest us said abdullah who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation he beat two of us who brought it up abdullah later ended up in the al nasr martyrs detention center where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality ethiopians 5 000 somalis 6 800 moroccans and egyptians 8 100 and finally bangladeshis a minimum 18 500 across the board women pay more abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee last july he and 18 others paid 48 000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours after a few days stuck at sea off the libyan coast under a sweltering sun they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end instead they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by tunisian fishermen who took them back to tunisia there are only three ways out of the prison you escape you pay ransom or you die abdullah said referring to the detention center in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centers and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the eu wants them to prevent letting migrants cross according to tarik lamloum the head of the libyan human rights organization beladi traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around 10 000 per boat that is allowed to pass with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favorable he said the head of libya s department for combating irregular migration or dcim the agency responsible for the detention centers under the ministry of interior acknowledged corruption and collusion among the militias and the coast guard and traffickers and even within the government itself they are in bed with them as well as people from my own agency said al mabrouk abdel hafez skimming profits beyond the direct abuse of migrants the militia network also profits by siphoning off money from eu funds sent for their food and security even those earmarked for a un run migrant center according to more than a dozen officials and aid workers in libya and tunisia as well as internal un emails and meeting minutes seen by the associated press an audit in may of the unhcr the un refugee agency responsible for the center found a lack of oversight and accountability at nearly all levels of spending in the libya mission the audit identified inexplicable payments in american dollars to libyan firms and deliveries of goods that were never verified in december 2018 during the period reviewed in the audit the un launched its migrant center in tripoli known as the gathering and departure facility or gdf as an alternative to detention for the recipients of the services contracts sent through the libyan government agency libaid it was a windfall millions of euros in contracts for food and migrant aid went to at least one company linked to al khoja the militia leader flown to rome for the un migration meeting according to internal un emails seen by the ap two senior libyan officials and an international aid worker al khoja is also the deputy head of the dcim the government agency responsible for the detention centers one of the libyan officials saw the multimillion euro catering contract with a company named ard al watan or the land of the nation which al khoja controls we feel like this is al khoja s fiefdom he controls everything he shuts the doors and he opens the doors said the official a former employee at the un center who like other libyan officials spoke anonymously out of fear for his safety he said al khoja used sections of the un center to train his militia fighters and built a luxury apartment inside even as the contracts for the un center were negotiated libyan officials said three libyan government agencies including the prosecutor s office were investigating al khoja

president donald trump s third year in office is coming to a close after a very eventful 2019 while impeachment dominated the news headlines over the past several months the administration also managed many accomplishment throughout the year to wrap up the year we ve created a list of trump s biggest wins of 2019 judicial appointments president trump has managed to reshape the judiciary branch in his image by nominating an unprecedented number of federal judges to the bench the senate has confirmed 187 trump nominated judges in just under three years this means 20 of the federal judiciary is now made up of trump appointments much of the administration s success can be credited to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell whose unparalleled focus on judicial appointments has ensured that nominees don t sit very long before being confirmed while members of the house debated the rules for impeaching the president several weeks ago mcconnell pushed 13 nominated judges through the senate the mueller report special counsel robert mueller released a report stemming from his two year long investigation into russian collusion this past april mueller was unable to establish that trump or his campaign participated in a conspiracy to work with the russian government to influence the 2016 election related ag barr bottom line from mueller report is no collusion mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether or not the president obstructed justice compelling attorney general bill barr to announce that the department of justice doj would not pursue that angle against the president the report appeared to knock down years of speculation that trump colluded with russia to get elected clearing a major cloud that hung over his presidency since his inauguration watch killing al baghdadi trump green lighted a u s special forces raid in late october that led to the death of abu bakr al baghdadi the leader of isis and one of the world s most wanted terrorists al baghdadi was reportedly chased into a dead end tunnel by a special forces canine where the isis leader is believed to have detonated a suicide vest that killed himself and three children shortly after that raid trump announced that the u s had also killed al baghdadi s replacement related president trump announces death of another isis leader just confirmed that abu bakr al baghdadi s number

agricultural goods and further protections on intellectual property space force trump signed the 2020 national defense authorization act into law dec 20 which formally created the u s space force the

since taking office to try to combat the national security and humanitarian crisis on the southern border but arguably the most successful in the administration s perspective has been the migrant protection protocols mpp program also known as the remain in mexico policy the mpp program requires asylum seekers to wait in mexico while their claims are processed in the u s clearing some of the overcrowding from u s detention centers in september nearly 50 000 asylum seekers were held in mexico under the program just 11 of those individuals ultimately qualified for asylum watch hostage negotiations the trump administration managed to negotiate the release of more american hostages this year including kevin king 63 who was held in afghanistan for three years and american graduate

be added black and hispanic unemployment have been at their lowest levels since the u s started recording those categories in september the black unemployment rate hit 5 5 while the hispanic unemployment rate hit 3 9 deregulation trump has outperformed his own promise to cut two regulations for every new one implemented since he took office according to the white house the administration has actually cut 8 and a half regulations for every new rule perhaps the administration s most talked about deregulatory efforts have been related to the environment in september for example trump rolled back the obama administration s waters of the us rule which saw farmers facing jail time and significant fines for being unable to comply with the rule in one case a 77 year old navy veteran served 18 months in prison after digging ponds around his property to keep wildfires at bay the environmental protection agency epa determined that the ponds were too close to navigable water and thus the veteran needed a permit for them trump similarly got rid of obama era rules that banned certain types of lightbulbs forcing american consumers to buy more expensive energy efficient bulbs related

all benefit from a vast web of government support officials in beijing arm chinese companies against their foreign rivals with discounted loans from state banks cheap land low cost electric power and cash infusions from officially approved investment funds the chinese effort is dogged long term and very well funded said john neuffer chief executive of the semiconductor industry association that s why the subsidy issue is such a big one for us under chinese president xi jinping who lacks his predecessors enthusiasm for the free market the state spigot has gushed aid china now devotes more than 3 of its annual output to direct and indirect business subsidies a share of the economy that is roughly equivalent to what the united states spends on defense according to economist nicholas lardy of the peterson institute for international economics a nonpartisan research group some of that aid is similar to programs in the united states and other advanced nations encouraging companies to retrain workers use less energy or otherwise support government goals but much of it is divorced from any consideration of profit and loss so it fuels excess production of goods like steel which spill into global markets depressing prices and making it hard for american companies to compete advertisement trump last year imposed tariffs on steel after the commerce department warned that the u s share of global production had fallen by nearly two thirds since 2000 under pressure from heavily subsidized chinese mills at the same time signs that china was lavishing state aid on efforts to supplant the united states as the global leader in advanced technology triggered trump s decision to launch his trade war with beijing subsidies are marbled throughout china s state led economy for chinese leaders they are a principal tool of economic management allowing them to steer credit land energy and other resources to favored state owned enterprises as well as private companies that beijing sees as strategic whatever the cost beijing s aid gives chinese companies an important edge in other markets peter navarro the president s principal white house trade adviser calls state subsidies one of china s seven deadly sins which must be cured before the two countries can enjoy normal trade ties in a 215 page report last year which kicked off trump s trade war with china u s trade representative robert lighthizer identified government financial support as a key element in china s plan to overtake u s technology leadership china is grossly subsidizing and taking over our markets he complained this summer before the senate finance committee but this massive program of government assistance has proved a double edged sword for china state help enabled chinese manufacturers to dominate markets for products such as auto parts but it also has left the economy riddled with unprofitable zombie firms and suffering from pervasive inefficiency economists said these subsidies are being directed in ways that are really distorting they are not being directed to dynamic firms said loren brandt an economist at the university of toronto indeed state owned firms have become steadily less profitable as they have gotten bigger over the decade to 2017 the biggest state owned enterprises nearly quadrupled their assets but their returns fell to 2 6 from a peak of 6 7 in 2007 even as they underperform state companies continue to enjoy easy access to loans from state banks meanwhile private companies with brighter prospects often struggle to obtain credit a lot of money s getting wasted there s a massive misallocation of resources in underperforming state companies said lardy author of the state strikes back the end of economic reform in china white house officials have acknowledged that some key issues remain unresolved lighthizer has said a lot of hard things have been left to future talks which most analysts say will be arduous and unlikely to bear fruit before the november election bargaining over industrial subsidies is expected to be particularly tough though trump launched the trade war to get china to change practices including its numerous subsidies the commercial conflict has only convinced xi to accelerate efforts to become self sufficient no matter the cost the hard liner view they re the ones who seem to have xi jinping s ear or this is the way xi thinks himself said brandt but it s clear that the more reformist constituency has lost out the world trade organization prohibits subsidies that are directly linked to exports or that require the use of domestic goods the u s has won at least three disputes over chinese subsidies before the global trading body including in 2011 when china agreed to halt a program of wind turbine subsidies after u s complaints but the wto rules are poorly designed for a nonmarket economy of china s size and importance to global trade one problem is keeping track of the subsidies which are often hidden or indirect chinese makers of aluminum products appear to be driven by profits but they benefit from government policies that provide cheap energy to the smelters that produce aluminum and from export limits that lead to a domestic glut which keeps aluminum prices down too they can be really effective selling into the u s or europe said chad bown another peterson economist it s just that all of their inputs are subsidized advertisement after china labeled shipbuilding a strategic industry in 2006 the government funded several new shipyards and an array of subsidies that saved the industry up to 4 5 billion over a six year period according to research by economist myrto kalouptsidi of harvard university china quickly doubled its market share from roughly one quarter of world ship orders to half grabbing business from japan south korea and europe only after analyzing shipyards in several countries and ruling out alternative explanations was kalouptsidi able to estimate the extent of chinese subsidies it is practically impossible to explain the rapid increase in china s market share without pointing to subsidies she wrote in a 2018 paper under wto rules the u s can impose steep tariffs to counteract the effects of a trading partner s subsidies if they injure american companies the administration has stepped up its use of trade remedies to counter chinese subsidies hitting in the past two months imports of steel staples diamond saw blades hardwood lumber and ceramic tiles with defensive levies of as much as 356 about 10 of all chinese imports more than 50 billion worth of goods now face countersubsidy or anti dumping tariffs according to bown that is apart from separate levies the president imposed on 360 billion in chinese products over the past 18 months using such tariffs offers little prospect of success though against china s multipronged effort to promote its domestic semiconductor industry chinese central and provincial governments have earmarked about 100 billion for equity investments credit lines and various grants over the next five years so china will become by 2030 the global leader in an industry now dominated by u s firms private equity funds backed by the state are funneling cash into china s semiconductor industry helping build and outfit dozens of new fabrication plants there are now more than 1 600 of these government guided funds commanding a total of 570 billion according to zero2ipo research center a beijing based consultancy advertisement unlike traditional private equity investors in the u s these chinese funds are willing to accept subpar returns to meet government goals two chinese companies smic and tsinghua unigroup derive more than 30 of their annual revenue from government payments yet they offer their government investors below market returns according to a new study by the organization for economic cooperation and development in paris such investments are probably among the hardest forms of support to identify and quantify the oecd concluded despite years of free spending chinese semiconductor manufacturers remain far behind the u s state of the art even failed industrial policy however can distort global trade flows and hurt non chinese companies while the u s industry retains a solid lead over aspiring chinese rivals the semiconductor industry s neuffer says the administration needs a broader response along with combating chinese trade practices the u s should be emphasizing workforce development competition policy and opening other markets overseas we need an affirmative agenda too he said

story of prudence aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through libya aimée left cameroon in 2015 and when her family heard nothing from her for a year they thought she was dead but she was in detention and incommunicado in nine months at the abu salim detention center she told the ap she saw european union milk and diapers delivered by u n staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children including her toddler son aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink she said in 2017 an arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone they called my family and told them they had found me she said that s when my family sent money weeping aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of 670 to get her out of the center she could not say who got the money she was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention center where yet another ransom 750 this time had to be raised from her family her captors finally released the young mother who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol after her husband paid 850 for the passage a european humanitarian ship rescued aimée but her husband remains in libya aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the ap at sea in europe tunisia and rwanda and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in libya journalists also spoke with libyan government officials aid workers and businessmen in tripoli obtained internal u n emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts the issue of migration has convulsed europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016 fleeing violence and poverty in the mideast afghanistan and africa in 2015 the european union set up a fund intended to curb migration from africa from which money is sent to libya the eu gives the money mainly through the u n s international organization for migration iom and the high commissioner for refugees unhcr but libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war the west including the capital tripoli is ruled by a u n brokered government while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander khalifa hifter the chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants the eu s own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to libya budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium to high risk that europe s support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants and that the libyan government would deny access to detention centers a recent eu assessment found the world was likely to get the wrong perception that european money could be seen as supporting abuse despite the roles they play in the detention system in libya both the eu and the u n say they want the centers closed in a statement to the ap the eu said that under international law it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards the statement said the eu also says more than half of the money in its fund for africa is used to help and protect migrants and that it relies on the u n to spend the money wisely the u n said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the u n refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centers about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak u n backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention center named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the u n migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under u n sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to u n aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs center twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the center and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention center the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the center which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarik al sikka a detention center in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a center an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labor hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms center acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the center closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs center said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs center which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the u n and the eu the iom highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the u n s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact u n staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a u n sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither center responded to requests for comment the u n s international organization for migration acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said iom spokeswoman safa msehli failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men women and children the story of abdullah a sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is all told the group of 47 in his first crossing from tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed libyan and his cronies 127 000 in a mix of dollars euros and libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention center and cross in two boats they were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed libyan shaken down for their cell phones and more money and tossed back into detention we talked to him and asked him why did you let us out and then arrest us said abdullah who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation he beat two of us who brought it up abdullah later ended up in the al nasr martyrs detention center where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality ethiopians 5 000 somalis 6 800 moroccans and egyptians 8 100 and finally bangladeshis a minimum 18 500 across the board women pay more abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee last july he and 18 others paid 48 000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours after a few days stuck at sea off the libyan coast under a sweltering sun they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end instead they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by tunisian fishermen who took them back to tunisia there are only three ways out of the prison you escape you pay ransom or you die abdullah said referring to the detention center in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centers and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the eu wants them to prevent letting migrants cross according to tarik lamloum the head of the libyan human rights organization beladi traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around 10 000 per boat that is allowed to pass with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favorable he said the head of libya s department for combating irregular migration or dcim the agency responsible for the detention centers under the ministry of interior acknowledged corruption and collusion among the militias and the coast guard and traffickers and even within the government itself they are in bed with them as well as people from my own agency said al mabrouk abdel hafez skimming profits beyond the direct abuse of migrants the militia network also profits by siphoning off money from eu funds sent for their food and security even those earmarked for a u n run migrant center according to more than a dozen officials and aid workers in libya and tunisia as well as internal u n emails and meeting minutes seen by the associated press an audit in may of the unhcr the u n refugee agency responsible for the center found a lack of oversight and accountability at nearly all levels of spending in the libya mission the audit identified inexplicable payments in american dollars to libyan firms and deliveries of goods that were never verified in december 2018 during the period reviewed in the audit the u n launched its migrant center in tripoli known as the gathering and departure facility or gdf as an alternative to detention for the recipients of the services contracts sent through the libyan government agency libaid it was a windfall millions of euros in contracts for food and migrant aid went to at least one company linked to al khoja the militia leader flown to rome for the u n migration meeting according to internal u n emails seen by the ap two senior libyan officials and an international aid worker al khoja is also the deputy head of the dcim the government agency responsible for the detention centers one of the libyan officials saw the multimillion euro catering contract with a company named ard al watan or the land of the nation which al khoja controls we feel like this is al khoja s fiefdom he controls everything he shuts the doors and he opens the doors said the official a former employee at the u n center who like other libyan officials spoke anonymously out of fear for his safety he said al khoja used sections of the u n center to train his militia fighters and built a luxury apartment inside even as the contracts for the u n center were negotiated libyan officials said three libyan government agencies were investigating al khoja in connection with the disappearance of 570 million from government spending allocated to feed migrants in detention centers in the west at the time al khoja already ran another center for migrants tarik al sikka notorious for abuses including beating hard labor and a massive ransom scheme tekila an eritrean refugee said that for two years at tarik al sikka he and other migrants lived on macaroni even after he was among 25 people who came down with tuberculosis a disease exacerbated by malnutrition tekila asked that only his first name be used for his safety when there is little food there is no choice but to go to sleep he said despite internal u n emails warning of severe malnutrition inside tarik al sikka u n officials in february and march 2018 repeatedly visited the detention center to negotiate the future opening of the gdf ap saw emails confirming that by july 2018 the unhcr s chief of mission was notified that companies controlled by al khoja s militia would receive subcontracts for services yaxley the spokesman for unhcr emphasized that the officials the agency works with are all under the authority of the ministry of interior he said unhcr monitors expenses to make sure its standard rules are followed and may withhold payments otherwise a senior official at libaid the libyan government agency that managed the center with the u n said the contracts are worth at least 7 million for catering cleaning and security and 30 out of the 65 libaid staff were essentially ghost employees who showed up on the payroll sight unseen the u n center was a treasure trove the senior libaid official lamented there was no way you could operate while being surrounded by tripoli militias it was a big gamble an internal u n communication from early 2019 shows it was aware of the problem the note found a high risk that food for the u n center was being diverted to militias given the amount budgeted compared to the amount migrants were eating in general around 50 dinars a day or 35 is budgeted per detainee for food and other essentials for all centers according to two libyan officials two owners of food catering companies and an international aid worker of that only around 2 dinars is actually spent on meals according to their rough calculations and migrants descriptions despite the investigations into al khoja tarik al sikka and another detention center shared a 996 000 euro grant from the eu and italy in february at the zawiya center emergency goods delivered by u n agencies ended up redistributed half for the prisoners half for the workers said orobosa bright a nigerian who endured three stints there for a total of 11 months many of the goods end up on libya s black market as well libyan officials and international aid workers say iom s spokeswoman said aid diversion is a reality in libya and beyond and that the agency does its best msehli said if it happens regularly iom will be forced to re evaluate its supports to detention centers despite our awareness that any reduction in this lifesaving assistance will add to the misery of migrants despite the corruption the detention system in libya is still expanding in places with money from europe at a detention center in sabaa where migrants are already going hungry they were forced to build yet another wing funded by the italian government said lamloum the libyan aid worker the italian government did not respond to a request for comment lamloum sent a photo of the new prison it has no windows tunisia laundering the money earned off the suffering of migrants is whitewashed in money laundering operations in tunisia libya s neighbor in the town of ben gardane dozens of money changing stalls transform libyan dinars dollars and euros into tunisian currency before the money continues on its way to the capital tunis even libyans without residency can open a bank account tunisia also offers another opportunity for militia networks to make money off european funds earmarked for migrants because of libya s dysfunctional banking system where cash is scarce and militias control accounts international organizations give contracts usually in dollars to libyan organizations with bank accounts in tunisia the vendors compound the money on libya s black market exchange which ranges between 4 and 9 times greater than the official rate libya s government handed over more than 100 files to tunisia earlier this year listing companies under investigation for fraud and money laundering the companies largely involve militia warlords and politicians according to nadia saadi a manager at the tunisian anti corruption authority the laundering involves cash payments for real estate falsified customs documents and faked bills for fictitious companies all in all libya is run by militias said a senior libyan judicial official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of risking his life whatever governments say and whatever uniform they wear or stickers they put this is the bottom line husni bey a prominent businessman in libya said the idea of europe sending aid money to libya a

money wisely the u n said the situation in libya is highly complex and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants unhcr does not choose its counterparts said charlie yaxley a spokesman for the u n refugee agency some presumably also have allegiances with local militias after two weeks of being questioned by the ap unhcr said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries due in part to the escalating conflict in tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of unhcr s programme unhcr decided to contract directly for these services from 1 january 2020 yaxley said julien raickman who until recently was the libya mission chief for the aid group médecins sans frontières also known as doctors without borders believes the problem starts with europe s unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration if you were to treat dogs in europe the way these people are treated it would be considered a societal problem he said extortion inside the detention centers about 5 000 migrants in libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time depending on who is counting and when most are concentrated in the west where the militias are more powerful than the weak u n backed government aid intended for migrants helps support the al nasr martyrs detention center named for the militia that controls it in the western coastal town of zawiya the u n migration agency the iom keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants and its staff and that of the unhcr visit the compound regularly yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center according to more than a dozen migrants libyan aid workers libyan officials and european human rights groups a unhcr report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well and the head of the militia mohammed kachlaf is under u n sanctions for human trafficking kachlaf other militia leaders named by the ap and the libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment many migrants recalled being cut shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards they also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off limits to u n aid workers families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay or are sent videos afterward eric boakye a ghanaian was locked in the al nasr martyrs center twice both times after he was intercepted at sea most recently around three years ago the first time his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free he tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers they cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks he said lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money the new price for freedom around 2 000 that was more than his family could scrape together boakye finally managed to escape he worked small jobs for some time to save money then tried to cross again on his fourth try he was picked up by the ocean viking humanitarian ship to be taken to italy in all boakye had paid 4 300 to get out of libya fathi al far the head of the al nasr international relief and development agency which operates at the center and has ties to the militia denied that migrants are mistreated he blamed misinformation on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum i am not saying it s paradise we have people who have never worked before with the migrants they are not trained he said but he called the al nasr martyrs detention center the most beautiful in the country at least five former detainees showed an ap journalist scars from their injuries at the center which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families one man had bullet wounds to both feet and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade all said they had to pay to get out five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from 1 800 to 8 500 each the former migrants said at al nasr they said the militia gets around 14 000 every day from ransoms at tarik al sikka a detention center in tripoli it was closer to 17 000 a day they said they based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid by scraping together money from family and friends the militias also make money from selling groups of migrants who then often simply disappear from a center an analysis commissioned by the eu and released earlier this month by the global initiative against transnational organized crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers as well as into prostitution and forced labor hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited according to médecins sans frontières there s no way to tell where they went but msf suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers a former guard at the khoms center acknowledged to the ap that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti aircraft guns and rpgs he said he couldn t keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center i don t want to remember what happened he said the iom was present at khoms he noted but the center closed last year a man who remains detained at the al nasr martyrs center said libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people twice this fall he said they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center s detainees revolted fighting engulfed zawiya last week but migrants remained locked inside the al nasr martyrs center which is also being used for weapons storage trafficking and interception at sea even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers they are rarely free instead the militias sell them to traffickers who promise to take them across the mediterranean to europe for a further fee these traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members the ap found the libyan coast guard is supported by both the u n and the eu the iom highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its libya home page europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in europe this fall italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels and it delivered 10 new speedboats to libya in november in internal documents obtained in september by the european watchdog group statewatch the european council described the coast guard as operating effectively thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years the libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9 000 people in 2019 en route to europe and returned them to libya this year after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with european encouragement what s unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al nasr martyrs facility in zawiya the coast guard unit at zawiya is commanded by abdel rahman milad who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the u n s security council yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants they contact u n staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him milad remains free because he has the support of the al nasr militia in 2017 before the sanctions milad was even flown to rome along with a militia leader mohammed al khoja as part of a libyan delegation for a u n sponsored migration meeting in response to the sanctions milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men migrants named at least two other operations along the coast at zuwara and tripoli that they said operated along the same lines as milad s neither center responded to requests for comment the u n s international organization for migration acknowledged to the ap that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for iom to provide support services to migrants and the local population said iom spokeswoman safa msehli failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men women and children the story of abdullah a sudanese man who made two attempts to flee libya shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is all told the group of 47 in his first crossing from tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed libyan and his cronies 127 000 in a mix of dollars euros and libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention center and cross in two boats they were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed libyan shaken down for their cell phones and more money and tossed back into detention we talked to him and asked him why did you let us out and then arrest us said abdullah who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation he beat two of us who brought it up abdullah later ended up in the al nasr martyrs detention center where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality ethiopians 5 000 somalis 6 800 moroccans and egyptians 8 100 and finally bangladeshis a minimum 18 500 across the board women pay more abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee last july he and 18 others paid 48 000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours after a few days stuck at sea off the libyan coast under a sweltering sun they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end instead they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by tunisian fishermen who took them back to tunisia there are only three ways out of the prison you escape you pay ransom or you die abdullah said referring to the detention center in all abdullah spent a total of 3 300 to leave libya s detention centers and take to the sea he ended up barely 100 miles away sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the eu wants them to prevent letting migrants cross according to tarik lamloum the head of the libyan human rights organization beladi traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around 10 000 per boat that is allowed to pass with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favorable he said the head of libya s department for combating irregular migration or dcim the agency responsible for the detention centers under the ministry of interior acknowledged corruption and collusion among the militias and the coast guard and traffickers and even within the government itself they are in bed with them as well as people from my own agency said al mabrouk abdel hafez skimming profits beyond the direct abuse of migrants the militia network also profits by siphoning off money from eu funds sent for their food and security even those earmarked for a u n run migrant center according to more than a dozen officials and aid workers in libya and tunisia as well as internal u n emails and meeting minutes seen by the associated press an audit in may of the unhcr the u n refugee agency responsible for the center found a lack of oversight and accountability at nearly all levels of spending in the libya mission the audit identified inexplicable payments in american dollars to libyan firms and deliveries of goods that were never verified in december 2018 during the period reviewed in the audit the u n launched its migrant center in tripoli known as the gathering and departure facility or gdf as an alternative to detention for the recipients of the services contracts sent through the libyan government agency libaid it was a windfall millions of euros in contracts for food and migrant aid went to at least one company linked to al khoja the militia leader flown to rome for the u n migration meeting according to internal u n emails seen by the ap two senior libyan officials and an international aid worker al khoja is also the deputy head of the dcim the government agency responsible for the detention centers one of the libyan officials saw the multimillion euro catering contract with a company named ard al watan or the land of the nation which al khoja controls we feel like this is al khoja s fiefdom he controls everything he shuts the doors and he opens the doors said the official a former employee at the u n center who like other libyan officials spoke anonymously out of fear for his safety he said al khoja used sections of the u n center to train his militia fighters and built a luxury apartment inside even as the contracts for the u n center were negotiated libyan officials said three libyan government agencies were investigating al khoja in connection with the disappearance of 570 million from government spending allocated to feed migrants in detention centers in the west at the time al khoja already ran another center for migrants tarik al sikka notorious for abuses including beating hard labor and a massive ransom scheme tekila an eritrean refugee said that for two years at tarik al sikka he and other migrants lived on macaroni even after he was among 25 people who came down with tuberculosis a disease exacerbated by malnutrition tekila asked that only his first name be used for his safety when there is little food there is no choice but to go to sleep he said despite internal u n emails warning of severe malnutrition inside tarik al sikka u n officials in february and march 2018 repeatedly visited the detention center to negotiate the future opening of the gdf ap saw emails confirming that by july 2018 the unhcr s chief of mission was notified that companies controlled by al khoja s militia would receive subcontracts for services yaxley the spokesman for unhcr emphasized that the officials the agency works with are all under the authority of the ministry of interior he said unhcr monitors expenses to make sure its standard rules are followed and may withhold payments otherwise a senior official at libaid the libyan government agency that managed the center with the u n said the contracts are worth at least 7 million for catering cleaning and security and 30 out of the 65 libaid staff were essentially ghost employees who showed up on the payroll sight unseen the u n center was a treasure trove the senior libaid official lamented there was no way you could operate while being surrounded by tripoli militias it was a big gamble an internal u n communication from early 2019 shows it was aware of the problem the note found a high risk that food for the u n center was being diverted to militias given the amount budgeted compared to the amount migrants were eating in general around 50 dinars a day or 35 is budgeted per detainee for food and other essentials for all centers according to two libyan officials two owners of food catering companies and an international aid worker of that only around 2 dinars is actually spent on meals according to their rough calculations and migrants descriptions despite the investigations into al khoja tarik al sikka and another detention center shared a 996 000 euro grant from the eu and italy in february at the zawiya center emergency goods delivered by u n agencies ended up redistributed half for the prisoners half for the workers said orobosa bright a nigerian who endured three stints there for a total of 11 months many of the goods end up on libya s black market as well libyan officials and international aid workers say iom s spokeswoman said aid diversion is a reality in libya and beyond and that the agency does its best msehli said if it happens regularly iom will be forced to re evaluate its supports to detention centers despite our awareness that any reduction in this lifesaving assistance will add to the misery of migrants despite the corruption the detention system in libya is still expanding in places with money from europe at a detention center in sabaa where migrants are already going hungry they were forced to build yet another wing funded by the italian government said lamloum the libyan aid worker the italian government did not respond to a request for comment lamloum sent a photo of the new prison it has no windows tunisia laundering the money earned off the suffering of migrants is whitewashed in money laundering operations in tunisia libya s neighbor in the town of ben gardane dozens of money changing stalls transform libyan dinars dollars and euros into tunisian currency before the money continues on its way to the capital tunis even libyans without residency can open a bank account tunisia also offers another opportunity for militia networks to make money off european funds earmarked for migrants because of libya s dysfunctional banking system where cash is scarce and militias control accounts international organizations give contracts usually in dollars to libyan organizations with bank accounts in tunisia the vendors compound the money on libya s black market exchange which ranges between 4 and 9 times greater than the official rate libya s government handed over more than 100 files to tunisia earlier this year listing companies under investigation for fraud and money laundering the companies largely involve militia warlords and politicians according to nadia saadi a manager at the tunisian anti corruption authority the laundering involves cash payments for real estate falsified customs documents and faked bills for fictitious companies all in all libya is run by militias said a senior libyan judicial official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of risking his life whatever governments say and whatever uniform they wear or stickers they put this is the bottom line husni bey a prominent businessman in libya said the idea of europe sending aid money to libya a once wealthy country suffering from corruption was ill conceived from the beginning europe wants to buy those who can stop smuggling with all of these programs bey said they would be much better off blacklisting the names of those involved in human trafficking fuel and drug smuggling and charging them with crimes instead of giving them money ___ michael reported from tripoli libya hinnant

preface the saints were robbed but the state s budget was saved the parachute press panicked over a pitiful hurricane but the advocate won the pulitzer for exemplifying the very best about local news reporting louisiana lost one of its champions kathleen babineaux blanco but not before she received the long overdue gratitude of a state that was enriched by her lifetime of trailblazing leadership and selfless service trump came to town but as for the president god bless his heart here on the bayou brief we told the true stories of an erector set and an abrascam but we began the year with an ode to clementine when we weren t covering the election we shared the tales of a long lost ship wreck and the forgotten but remarkable lives of the black captains and watermen who built louisiana back from the ruin of the civil war we reintroduced the state to a mayor named tilly who hoped to bring his city into the catfish farming business and tried to turn a swimming pool into a fishing pond but ended up leading the bottom feeders into a massacre we traced back the beginning of the old war skule to a union general and a confederate planter who carried the name of a founding father there were lyrical stories about listening to the river and about a small town named after a saint and ravaged by sinners and there were stories about the movies and the music that have defined and inspired us before we enter 2020 some hindsight is important in part one of this two part series we take inventory of the good the bad and the ugly of louisiana politics in 2019 le bon la brute et le truand de 2019 the good the bad and the ugly of 2019 a few years ago bob mann the popular lsu political communications professor biographer and erstwhile opinion columnist at the times picayune created his own annual awards which he would dole out at the end of the year in the pages of the newspaper and on his blog site something like the truth he named the competition after sergio leone s classic spaghetti western the good the bad and the ugly with his permission we are reviving this annual tradition with many of the same categories that he created years ago biggest winner gov john bel edwards in 2015 after he trounced the most powerful republican in the state the far right pilloried john bel edwards as the accidental governor serving up a giant dish of revisionist history to console themselves once voters finally had enough of david vitter on the day he took office edwards inherited a 2 1 billion budget shortfall and a legislature still under the spell of their most vituperative and mendacious members indeed the very people most responsible for negligently squandering the money that the public had entrusted to their care would spend the entirety of john bel edwards first term as governor obstinately refusing to help fix what they had broken and repeatedly misrepresenting what was at stake while the state s budgetary woes were the consequence of former gov jindal and this small cadre of the state s most virulent right wing partisans louisianians could have been spared much of the gridlock and dysfunction four years ago had it not been for a democratic state representative from new orleans neil abramson lining up against the election of a fellow new orleans democrat walt leger iii for speaker of the house abramson may have not been the deciding vote but by turning his back on the newly elected democratic governor and his colleague from new orleans he nonetheless played a pivotal role in guaranteeing leger s defeat and in justifying support for the feckless taylor barras in exchange for his defection abramson was given a plum assignment as chair of the house ways and means committee a role that proved to be entirely inconsequential in the grand scheme of things incidentally abramson s wikipedia page was altered to include the laughable claim that his constituents and his district were better served as a result of his support for barras although those edits have not yet been removed the user who made them was banned from wikipedia barras empowered a caucus led house where party became more important than process the advocate s lanny keller succinctly explained noting that barras was also arguably the nicest guy in the state capitol politics above all not agreeing with edwards was even more pernicious in the house the rules became obstructions to the legislative process shortly after barras was elected speaker breaking from decades of tradition in which the legislature deferred to the governor for guidance on selecting leadership house republican caucus chairman lance harris touted the importance of an independent legislature but as the past four years definitively proved barras tenure as speaker did not usher in a new era of principled independence instead the legislature particularly the house were dominated by obstructionists nonetheless despite the inability of some in the house to operate in good faith gov edwards managed to rack up a remarkable list of accomplishments and resuscitate state government from the disastrous and negligent decisions made during jindal s two terms the 2 1 billion shortfall with which jindal had saddled the state on his way out is now a 500 million surplus and as a result of edwards reversing course and accepting federal funding for medicaid expansion nearly 500 000 louisianians now have health insurance for the first time edwards has repeatedly characterized medicaid expansion as the easiest big decision he has ever made in his life in a rare bipartisan victory edwards and the legislature worked together to usher in a sweeping set of criminal justice reforms that ensured louisiana was no longer the world s leader in incarcerating its own citizens although he had preferred to address the state s budgetary woes by enacting a series of structural tax reforms and avoiding the hike in sales taxes favored by republicans his decision to provide local governments more control over who is awarded itep industrial tax exemption program incentives helps provide an additional layer of accountability and scrutiny to a program that has proven to be ripe for abuse similarly edwards support for the ongoing environmental litigation against oil and gas companies who illegally dredged canals and destroyed much of the state s already vulnerable coast in direct violation of the permits they were issued ensures that the wealthiest industry in the history of human civilization cannot bribe their way out of their responsibility to pay to fix what they broke the oil and gas and petrochemical companies that dominate the landscape of coastal louisiana and transformed the corridor between baton rouge and new orleans from river road into cancer alley have for far too long been allowed to operate with impunity and the residents who live in those communities deserve and demand justice as the white house reminded louisiana voters prior to the bizarre campaign rallies that donald trump hosted in support of eddie rispone the state s economy is performing better than ever unemployment is the lowest it s ever been and over the course of the past four years edwards and his team at led have landed a series of major economic development wins including a 2 000 job tech facility in new orleans the biggest of its kind in the nation although his list of accomplishments is impressive particularly considering the obstructionism he has faced in the legislature his decision to affirmatively sign into law the most draconian and punitive abortion law in the country which sought to prohibit the procedure after five weeks and provided no exceptions in the cases of rape or incest was rightfully criticized as cruel and brazenly unconstitutional indeed because of a recent decision by the u s fifth circuit court of appeals that involved a similar but less restrictive law that had recently passed in mississippi louisiana s law was rendered unenforceable while it is true that edwards had made his anti choice position clear during his first election and that the bill that was sent to his desk had the support of a veto proof majority in both chambers of the legislature citizens have a justifiable concern whenever their elected leaders attempt to codify and impose their own religious beliefs on others especially when they do so with the full knowledge that their actions are in direct violation of well settled law and nearly 50 years of supreme court precedent still fortunately most voters recognized the law s futility absent a complete reversal by the supreme court which is certainly possible but probably not plausible even in the court s current composition and they also recognized that eddie rispone represented a far more significant and much more immediate existential threat to healthcare in louisiana among other things rispone pledged to enact an enrollment freeze for medicaid applicants which experts believe would have resulted in more than 300 000 louisianians losing their health insurance coverage although it may not make any difference to hard liners in the legislature this year john bel edwards proved once and for all that his election in 2015 was not an accident he squared off against two formidable republican opponents a well liked conservative congressman and a wealthy political insider who spent 13 5 million of his own money on a campaign that hinged on ingratiating himself to supporters of the president indeed edwards didn t just have to beat ralph abraham and eddie rispone he also had to contend the hate machine of the trump campaign which invested an enormous amount of political capital in a state he had carried only three years prior by nearly twenty points in the end voters rewarded edwards for his steady competent leadership and rejected the brand of toxic vapid and insult driven partisanship that swept donald trump into a 77 000 vote electoral college victory over the candidate who had received nearly three million more votes nationwide hillary clinton edwards victory proved that his support is much deeper than his opponents had believed and that donald trump s support even in louisiana is far more shallow than they had imagined biggest loser tie donald j trump and john neely kennedy since our debut in 2017 we have made a conscientious decision to avoid publishing anything about the 45th president of the united states unless it specifically involves louisiana donald trump s tenure has been characterized by an abandonment of moral leadership and dominated by an erratic cruel and profoundly ignorant series of decisions that embolden racists weaken the rule of law and undermine the foundational aspirations of this nation of immigrants he has appealed to and mimicked the leadership style of authoritarians and despots he has regularly diminished the dignity of his office his twitter account is a never ending stream of self aggrandizing baseless braggadocio and unhinged jejune drivel and although the economy has continued to perform well for some there is nothing great about the america that has been made under his presidency but because our focus is on louisiana we haven t had much reason to write about him despite the fact that we are led by a democratic governor trump has never been outwardly or singularly antagonistic toward the bayou state and during the past three years somewhat astonishingly he has enjoyed a cordial working relationship with gov edwards in fact john bel edwards was the only democratic elected official invited to the white house for trump s very first state dinner which honored french president emanuel macron ironically the trump tax plan enacted into law in december of 2017 helped open up an additional source of revenue for the state triggering a louisiana law that requires any decrease in federal income tax be offset with a corresponding increase in state income tax and visa versa that said whatever marginal benefits louisiana has gained by having a working relationship with the white house are a credit to our governor s decency not to trump s leadership and they pale in comparison to the damage trump has inflicted on the nation s most marginalized communities that was underscored most prominently during the last month and a half of this year s campaign season when the president held three separate rallies in louisiana to campaign against edwards and it was especially obvious in the two rallies he held during the runoff in support of eddie rispone a man whose sycophancy toward the president was so over the top it seemed to make even trump uncomfortable indeed the white house struggled so much to justify his opposition to edwards that it ended up inadvertently making the case for his re election blanketing its social media accounts with talking points about how well the state s economy has performed during the past three years even though rispone had been attempting to convince voters exactly the opposite in trump s final rally in bossier city he only stuck to the script once reading from the teleprompter a series of prepared attack lines against edwards that were so absurd that trump at one point interrupted himself to let the audience know edwards had always been good to him in person but others told him the governor talked bad about him behind his back if you were paying close enough attention and recognized that the bluster had been written by a rispone campaign operative the subtext was clear he didn t believe a damn thing he was saying so why was he even there in the first place louisiana s junior senator john neely kennedy is a highly educated lawyer with degrees from vanderbilt the university of virginia and oxford but since arriving in d c in 2017 kennedy has spent the bulk of his time honing his acting skills he is the real world version of sophie lennon the character played by jane lynch in the amazon series the marvelous mrs maisel lennon a yale educated actress betrays her education and intelligence and becomes famous by performing the role of a gimmicky frumpy and crass comedienne from queens everything about the persona that made her popular is fake the accent the jokes the fat suit even the connection to new york kennedy similarly has made a name for himself in the senate by recycling the same formulaic one liners he used during his audition here as state treasurer all delivered with an accent that sounds more like east texas than south louisiana peter athas refers to these as neelyisms the beltway media has lapped it up even if back home most of us already know the routine in fact most of us remember when our junior senator was an outspoken democrat it wasn t that long ago and kennedy for his part has proven himself to be skilled at locating a spotlight and a microphone whenever he can it d be a mistake to confuse his huckster persona with a lack of intelligence as was made evident during his absolute evisceration of judicial nominee matthew petersen but there is a difference between being an intellectual and being intellectually honest and as hard as he tries to lampoon liberals as snobbish elites the truth is that john neely kennedy is just as much of a goats milk latte drinking elitist as the people he ridicules magna cum laude at vanderbilt order of the coif at uva law first class honors at oxford s magdalen college he s the author of an entire casebook on louisiana constitutional law and among other things a law review article titled the dimension of time in the louisiana products liability act during his eighteen year stint as louisiana state treasurer he ran for the united states senate three times in 2004 as a democrat he finished in third in the jungle primary behind fellow democrat chris john and republican david vitter who won outright four years later he ran again this time as a republican against incumbent mary landrieu and landrieu very effectively diminished his candidacy by branding his campaign as kennedy for whatever she also won outright but the third time was a charm in 2016 when in a 24 person field that included two republican congressmen two well funded democrats and former kkk grand wizard david duke kennedy squeaked out a 25 first place finish in the jungle primary and then trounced the second place finisher democratic public service commissioner foster campbell in the runoff initially he didn t seem to enjoy his new gig all that much and almost as soon as he was sworn in he signaled that he was entertaining a way out he began testing the waters on a potential run for louisiana governor but very quickly it became obvious that it d be an uphill battle most polls had edwards ahead of kennedy in a head to head match and perhaps most importantly the deep pocketed donors who had supported his run for senate weren t exactly thrilled with the idea of funding yet another kennedy for whatever campaign so eventually he made it clear that he had cooled to the idea and would be staying put however that didn t mean he had any intention of staying out throughout the campaign season kennedy took an unusually active interest in the affairs of state government trolling edwards whenever the opportunity presented itself even if the facts weren t on his side according to the new york times at least one member of louisiana s federal delegation with knowledge of the president s decision to involve himself in this year s gubernatorial campaign almost certainly not its lone democratic member u s rep cedric richmond kennedy shoulders much of the blame for convincing trump to campaign against edwards despite the objections of white house political aides this account matches what others have said on background to the bayou brief kennedy allegedly had misrepresented or cherry picked polling data and voter surveys to make the case to trump that edwards was far more vulnerable than he appeared to be the gambit backfired even though trump had essentially gone all in appearing in those three campaign rallies in louisiana and dispatching both his son and vice president mike pence he barely made a dint in turning out voters for rispone and whatever positive effect he may have had was offset by the negative trump not only couldn t claim a victory he had actually helped increase democratic enthusiasm for edwards most competent state sen w jay luneau even before this year s legislative session was gaveled in the louisiana association of business and industry labi the trade association that has devolved into a powerful right wing lobbying organization had made it clear their top legislative priority was the passage of a bill that claimed to be about reducing the price of auto insurance premiums something that nearly all louisianians would enthusiastically support but there was one small problem the bill they were promoting state rep kirk talbots s hb 372 the so called auto insurance premium reduction act of 2019 had almost nothing to do with reducing the cost of car insurance and nearly everything to do with protecting the profits of the insurance industry through a series of so called tort reforms in recent years labi has showered campaign cash on lawmakers with the best grades on its annual scorecard funneling the contributions through one or more of its four political action committees a questionable arrangement that may implicate the state s ethics laws according to two legal experts familiar with the practice for its part labi claims that legislators who support its agenda are not automatically rewarded with financial support in other words correlation does not equal causation but one thing is for certain because of its network of ancillary pacs labi is capable of single handedly funding candidates to run against lawmakers who stand in their way that creates an enormous disincentive for legislators who represent competitive districts to avoid outwardly antagonizing the organization put simply tort reform refers to any changes in the law that minimizes or eliminates a person s ability to hold a wrongdoer accountable in the civil justice system although there is no evidence whatsoever that demonstrates any direct connection between the premiums individuals pay for car insurance in louisiana and the amount of money the insurance industry as a whole spent on litigation in the state the business lobby specifically labi and the u s chamber of commerce have spent a veritable fortune attempting to convince the public that they are the victims of this stubborn little thing known as the law no doubt their case has been made easier by a small handful of personal injury attorneys who spend their own fortunes advertising how much money previous clients have received after being injured in a car wreck often in misleading and sensational terms for example instead of reporting the actual amount that an injured party received they instead advertise the total damages awarded conveniently leaving out the massive contingency fees their law firms typically collect labi had for years attempted to find a legitimate public policy justification to implement an array of tort reforms and with car insurance they believed they finally had something they could sneak through the legislature provided of course that no one asked too many questions about the bill itself perhaps not too surprisingly talbot s hb 372 breezed through the house but when it arrived in the state senate there was one member in particular who had read the bill thoroughly and done his homework state sen jay luneau a democrat from alexandria luneau is a lawyer by trade but he isn t the kind who advertises on billboards or day time court tv shows he simply wanted to know mechanically how talbot s bill would work how it would change existing law and the answer to a question no one had bothered to ask what it would cost up until that point labi had avoided labeling the bill as a tort reform measure focusing exclusively on the too good to be true promise of reducing the cost of car insurance but when luneau began asking questions it soon became readily apparent that the bill s central premise its primary public policy justification was a ruse as it turns out none of the proposed changes had ever been proven to have any correlation with the price of insurance premiums no one doubted that louisiana drivers pay too much the question was why the senate judiciary a committee on which luneau served as a member heard testimony from a national insurance expert douglas heller who outlined a number of sleazy ways the industry inflated prices for customers that had nothing whatsoever to do with a person s driving record separately the senate insurace committee heard from one of the state s top insurance lobbyists kevin cunningham who was ostensibly there in support of the bill but then unwittingly revealed that the proposed legislation was entirely based on a false premise i think it s a misnomer to ever really believe that your car insurance rates are ever going to go down cunningham said luneau had offered a separate bill that he then amended to include making a series of regulatory changes outlined by heller including ending the practice of discriminating against widows and widowers that bill failed to make it out of committee but most importantly jay luneau was successful at convincing his colleagues on the judiciary a committee to request a fiscal note from the state legislative auditor in order to get an informed estimate of the financial costs and benefits of the proposed legislation when the auditor s office provided the report it estimated that the savings were entirely speculative and in any event likely to be only very minimal at best but the costs to taxpayers would total in the millions of dollars every year the legislation would have resulted in a surge in the number of jury trials inundating an already overwhelmed civil justice system that proved to be the fatal blow for labi s most important bill of the year hb 372 died in the senate judiciary a committee however labi had hoped to have the last laugh against state sen jay luneau directly funneling 10 000 to the campaign of his opponent former one term state rep randy wiggins a state farm insurance agent all told wiggins received nearly 27 000 from political action committees and he personally loaned his campaign another 23 000 the vast majority of his individual donors were fellow insurance agents and brokers though altogether they barely covered his personal loans on the night of the jungle primary luneau won reelection in a landslide beating wiggins 61 39 and by more than 6 000 votes already far right legislators have signaled their intention to revive labi s half baked auto insurance bill during next year s session this time hopefully lawmakers will spend more energy working toward an actual solution instead of reflexively kowtowing to the demands of the insurance lobby either way they should expect at least one state senator to ask the tough questions most incompetent the campaign to create st george louisiana if at first you don t succeed lie lie again what had started as an effort to form a new school system turned into a years long campaign to create a brand new affluent and predominately white municipality in east baton rouge parish this year a slight majority of voters in the proposed city approved a ballot initiative enabling the establishment of what could become the fifth largest city in the state of louisiana despite its organizers knowing full and well that they were asking voters to saddle those who lived across the street and within the city limits of baton rouge with an enormous financial burden if the courts allow the city s creation to proceed then those who will suffer the most are already among the parish s most vulnerable let s not waltz around the obvious the initiative was animated by a series of thinly veiled racist and classist tropes that have persisted in louisiana since well before thomas jefferson struck a deal with napoleon bonaparte though the notion of using public education as a raison d etre is from the residue over school integration something that louisiana had stubbornly attempted to resist in the decades that followed the supreme court s 1954 decision in brown v board of education baton rouge was actually the first city in the country in which leaders of the civil right shirt movement staged a bus boycott and the legacy of slavery and jim crow have continued to perpetuate de facto segregation and created ample space for two very different versions of law enforcement as the entire nation was reminded by the harrowing video footage of alton sterling s final moments alive a meme posted on facebook by the organizers of the st george campaign comparing their effort to create the fifth largest city in louisiana by carving out a massive portion of east baton rouge parish to the american revolution st george it is worth noting is the patron saint of england predictably those who led the fight for st george insist that the effort has nothing to do with race and everything to do with ensuring local control but the historical truth cannot be altered to account for a contemporary and convenient blind spot indeed the taxpayers of baton rouge financed the infrastructure upon which the would be city is built something that again has been conveniently ignored but willful ignorance and myopia are not the only reasons we selected the organizers of the campaign to create st george as the winners of the most incompetent award because no doubt many of those who voted in favor of the new municipality were not motivated by the kind of racial antipathy that had initially informed the proposal many were instead led to believe that the new city would be financially self sustaining and would have almost no negative impact on the region moreover they were also told that the proposal was in compliance with existing law all of these things are untrue rather than confront the stark reality that their numbers simply did not add up campaign organizers continually insisted otherwise even if it meant rejecting the findings of multiple comprehensive analyses and reports because so many of the existing retail and commercial developments upon which they had relied to ensure the new city s financial solvency decided instead to request annexation into baton rouge it s unclear how exactly st george would provide for even the most basic services they may be able to form a breakaway public school district but they apparently won t have enough money to fund their own police department additionally as was clear from the very beginning the proposal is in direct violation of the approved city parish plan of government which expressly prohibits the formation of any new municipalities organizers may have fashioned themselves as patriotic revolutionaries but there is nothing virtuous or patriotic about capriciously harming your neighbors and misrepresenting the truth about the costs of breaking away most improved col rob maness in 2017 following two failed bids for the united states senate rob maness a retired air force colonel from st tammany parish found himself in the middle of a surprisingly competitive race for state representative a seat he should have been able to easily win when he lost his cool maness had decided to openly criticize his fellow republicans for abandoning alabama judge roy moore after several women alleged moore had sexually assaulted them years ago including two women who claimed the abuse occurred when they were teenagers and moore was in his thirties there was nothing righteous about manesss position the allegations were credible and lurid and ultimately even voters in ruby red alabama couldn t stomach the prospect of being represented by an alleged child molester but when david bellinger a liberal commentator who frequently calls into jim engster s radio show confronted maness on air and labeled him an extremist the retired military veteran erupted blow me and get out of here he said to bellinger bellinger it is worth noting has made headlines before for crawling under the skin of republican candidates and elected officials in the book republican gomorrah inside the movement that shattered the party writer max blumenthal recounts a memorable exchange that bellinger who often uses the nom de plume flaming liberal had in 2003 with then congressman david vitter for maness the exchange with bellinger marked a low point in his public career and he would go onto lose the race for state representative to another republican covington city councilman mark wright but this year maness did something unusual particularly in the current era of toxic partisanship he decided to take a principled stance against the very political party he had once reflexively championed and in speaking about his decision he shared details about the pain that he and his family had endured as a direct consequence of the actions taken by louisiana gop mega donor and would be kingmaker lane grigsby maness decided he d had enough after grigsby attempted to bribe a republican candidate to drop out of a race for the legislature that had appeared to be headed toward a rare three person runoff and subsequently boasted about the imperial control he had over the state gop two years prior grigsby had helped to finance a series of especially nasty attack ads against maness and as a result maness autistic son was abandoned by his only two friends initially even though he d announced that he had left the republican party and would be voting for divided government maness couldn t bring himself to expressly endorsing the democratic incumbent john bel edwards but that changed after eddie rispone appeared on a morning radio show on alexandria s ksyl and told host jim leggett that west point should be ashamed that gov edwards was a graduate maness may not share the same politics as those of us at the bayou brief but his decision to publicly repudiate the endemic corruption and defend the integrity of a leader on the other side of the aisle is commendable and a complete reversal from his cynical defense of judge moore only two years prior which as david bellinger accurately pointed out was extremist it s unfortunately uncommon for a politician to admit his mistakes and to put principle above party and it s especially rare for conservatives in the age of the most mendacious president in american history shameless ambition gary landrieu shortly after gary landrieu showed up to qualify as a candidate for governor he was told by an official with the louisiana secretary of state that he wouldn t be allowed to use the nickname go gary on the ballot of course louisiana has had its fair share of candidates who prefer to be known by a nickname including former governors bobby jindal and mike foster and we ve had an ample supply of candidates whose nicknames are far less common and much more absurd who can forgot chicken commander or live wire or cowboy phil if they were around today does anyone doubt that earl k long wouldn t ask to appear on the ballot as uncle earl or that his brother huey wouldn t be tempted to have kingfish appear next to his name the problem with go gary was that it very clearly wasn t actually his real nickname it was his campaign slogan gary the first cousin of mary and mitch and the nephew of moon seems to enjoy capitalizing off of the surname that was made famous in louisiana by his more accomplished adult relatives this wasn t his first attempt at elected office in 2012 and in 2014 he challenged cedric richmond for congress and in between those two bids he campaigned for a seat as councilman at large in new orleans in 2016 he qualified as a candidate for the u s senate but by then it had become obvious that he was more of a professional troll than a serious candidate this year though he deserves the shameless ambition award not merely because of the ways in which he has acted out his own issues with family jealousy but because of how he behaved after being told he couldn t use go gary as his nickname instead of accepting the decision in stride gary summoned his elderly mother to the secretary of state s office in baton rouge to have her repeat the ridiculous lie that go gary was a nickname that dated back to his childhood that was shameful of him and the only convincing part of the whole spectacle was that his disrespect the secretary of state s office didn t budge on its decision and as it turns out go gary couldn t even get his own nickname right for several days his campaign facebook page directed people to the web domain gogaygovernor com most authentic latoya cantrell from left to right louisiana first lady donna edwards louisiana gov john bel edwards new orleans mayor latoya cantrell and james carville at a fundraiser hosted by carville during the gubernatorial runoff election she was a still a teenager when she arrived in the city she would one day become the first woman ever to lead an incoming freshman at the one and only catholic hbcu in the nation xavier university located in the heart of gert town back in those days the litmus test question that established a person s new orleans bonafides where d you go to high school carried with it implications about a person s pedigree their class their race their religion and even their place in the city s history but latoya cantrell went to palmdale high school nearly 2 000 miles away from the big easy on the other side of the san gabriel mountains from los angeles that meant a few things yes she was an outsider but she was also more free to define herself on her own terms than most of her new orleans born classmates the downside of course was it d be difficult if not impossible for her to ever be accepted as authentically new orleanian before cantrell s election in 2018 the last person to be elected mayor of new orleans who wasn t actually a native of the city was vic schiro in 1961 schiro was born in chicago but unlike cantrell he moved to new orleans with his family when he was still a small child he could have answered the question about where he went to high school before schiro there was delesseps story chep morrison one of the most consequential mayors of the last century morrison was born in tiny new roads louisiana the seat of pointe coupee parish but through his mother mayor morrison was a descendant of three iconic new orleans families the delesseps the storys and the tremés the city s former red light district storyville was named after one of his cousins and his third great grandfather was claude tremé whose surname also appears prominently on the city map the point is for most of its history despite the fact that it has always been a cosmopolitan city of immigrants new orleans has nonetheless been known to be wary of outsiders latoya cantrell didn t inherit a famous name and although father in law magistrate judge harry cantrell is also an elected official she didn t marry into a well known political family either judge cantrell won his first election in 2013 a year after latoya cantrell had won her first defeating dana kaplan for the district b seat on the new orleans city council despite being outspent nearly six to one indeed her first election would serve as a blueprint for how she approached the race for mayor relying on an aggressive and relentless field operation that allowed her to build personal relationships with hundreds if not thousands of residents all throughout the city as a councilwoman and before that as a neighborhood leader cantrell made a name for herself as an outspoken advocate for affordable housing and equitable redevelopment she didn t get everything right all of the time her ambivalence about the removal of four white supremacist and lost cause monuments for example wasn t exactly a profile in courage and although she ultimately voted in favor of their removal the concerns she had expressed about procedural trivialities were unconvincing during her year and a half as new orleans mayor however cantrell has consistently proven herself to be a born leader particularly when the stakes are high and the spotlight is on she has repeatedly stood up against the trump administration s egregious and inhumane treatment of undocumented immigrants and when it looked possible that eddie rispone a man who had denounced new orleans for being a sanctuary city it s not and promised to dispatch gestapo like raids in order to arrest and deport those found to be residing in the city without the requisite documentation could be elected governor cantrell turned action new orleans the organization that was born from her campaign operation into high gear earning the attention and the admiration of several national democratic leaders including sec clinton to be sure there have been slip ups and mistakes most notably her decision to quietly approve lowering the speed threshold on traffic cameras located in school zones which quickly generated more than 1 million in anticipated revenue from tickets sent to unsuspecting drivers in april the times picayune s james gill excoriated cantrell for hornswoggling new orleans voters over the traffic camera issue as a result of the public backlash against the way in which the new policy had been rolled out the city decided to refund drivers who were ticketed before the changes were announced others have criticized the cantrell administration for its lackadaisical approach toward enacting or enforcing a coherent set of regulations that could stem the unfettered proliferation of short term rentals which have already priced many people out of the city s increasingly expensive housing market but when faced with the biggest and most important test that she has encountered thus far the looming threat of a potential hurricane aiming its sights on the louisiana coast latoya cantrell was at her absolute best looking less like a rookie mayor and more like a seasoned veteran who knew how to speak with authority and calm the nerves of a city that the national media had shamelessly attempted to stir into a panicked frenzy without question her steady even keeled approach along with the city s near perfect deployment of its emergency preparedness protocols prevented the kind of nightmare scenario similar to the one that unfolded in houston in 2005 when more than 100 people died in the process of evacuating in advance of hurricane rita rita pummeled the lake charles area but houston was spared completely cantrell deserves immense credit for refusing to contribute to the sensational and entirely baseless doom and gloom that was being sold by the national media at one point her team even called out the washington post directly for its irresponsible coverage and since this is about her authenticity it s also worth mentioning that her enthusiasm for the saints isn t something you can fake in a state dominated by the far right and represented in washington by seven white republicans all of whom have tethered themselves to a president that with only one exception clay higgins they had privately opposed as a candidate and only one african american democrat latoya cantrell offers a refreshing reminder that in louisiana our very best leaders have always known how to inspire people by simply being honest with themselves biggest blunder eddie rispone s first commercial this year eddie rispone accomplished something extraordinarily rare in american politics he somehow managed to lose support from the commercial that introduced him as a candidate for governor it s difficult to overstate how disastrous his debut was over the next five months he would end up spending 13 5 million of his own money attempting to repair the damage it s important to note that prior to declaring his candidacy rispone had been almost completely unknown even today with the benefit of hindsight he still seems to believe that the problem with the commercial was the pitch of his voice and not the pitch he was selling cluelessly claiming to the advocate that the team he had hired didn t realize he normally didn t sound as nasally notwithstanding the fact that presumably he still approved and paid for the ad to blanket the airwaves no the most glaring problem with the ad had nothing to do with his ross perot impression the problem was its basic premise it wasn t about eddie rispone the self made millionaire with a vision for how to lead louisiana perhaps because he didn t really have much of a vision other than changing a few things that would financially benefit his business the commercial was about eddie rispone trump supporter and right out of the gate eddie rispone trump supporter made himself immediately unlikable to nearly half of the state s electorate and antagonized the entire city of new orleans trump may remain slightly above water in louisiana with 53 of voters approving of his job performance but according to morning consult since taking office donald trump s net approval in the state has decreased by 21 points by putting trump who wasn t even on the ballot front and center literally towering over rispone and his wife rispone had effectively introduced himself not as a leader but as a follower but the decision to frame his introductory commercial around his obsequious support of the president isn t the only reason the ad was such a spectacular failure rispone outlined three things he would do if elected governor work with the president on protecting constitutional rights i e the second amendment not the first or the fourteenth amendments ban sanctuary cities and to ensure everyone understood he was talking about new orleans he included aerial footage of the french quarter and end taxpayer benefits for illegal immigrants a nonsensical and vague pledge he would make repeatedly and that apparently referred to an estimate that 0 05 of medicaid spending went toward physicians and hospitals for treating undocumented patients put another way rispone s message was trump guns and illegal immigration all issues that may have poll tested well with conservative voters but have almost nothing to do with the job responsibilities of the governor but the line that was most memorable and that ended up defining rispone for the rest of the election was his reference to the trump bumper sticker he put on his pick up truck he may have been telling the truth but because of the way the commercial was staged it came across as frivolous and scripted soon thereafter gumbopac responded with an ad that would end up defining him for the rest of the election season and would be replicated later by john bel edwards campaign a still frame image from rispone s debut commercial of the republican candidate sitting on the flatbed of his truck with his trump bumper sticker visible on the back windshield along with a caption that succinctly expressed what most people were thinking phony rispone most innovative idea douglas heller during the discussion that occurred in the state capitol this year over how to best address the state s high price of auto insurance most lawmakers and even a few members of the media seemed more than happy to accept at face value the specious arguments made by the louisiana association of business and industry labi as we mentioned earlier the right wing business lobbying organization was nearly successful in ramming through a series of changes to existing law that purported to be designed to lower car insurance premiums but actually amounted to a costly giveaway to the insurance industry all intended to rig the civil justice system against drivers and in favor of insurance companies it s always a good idea to be skeptical whenever politicians begin preaching about tort reform because most of the time the real aim is to make it more difficult for ordinary americans to hold the powerful accountable there is no question that car insurance is too expensive in louisiana depending on who you ask we pay either the second or fourth highest prices in the nation on insurance premiums however there is significant disagreement about what is driving up those costs the insurance industry blames trial lawyers suggesting that people like gordon mckernan and morris bart whose billboards and commercials are ubiquitous across the state are the symptom of a legal climate that makes it vastly more expensive to do business they latch onto isolated and often inaccurate stories about frivolous lawsuits and staged car wrecks to illustrate their point and in so doing they ve been able to convince a great number of otherwise reasonable people that the insurance companies are the real victims not the people who seek remedy through the justice system it should be obvious but considering the way in which the debate has been framed in louisiana it bears emphasis if you re in a dispute with an insurance company you re inherently at a disadvantage they hold nearly all of the cards it also should be noted despite their pollyannish outrage over lawyers who advertise their services the insurance industry spends more every year on advertising than almost anyone else in the state of louisiana easily five times the amount the legal industry spends this year the bayou brief teamed up with douglas heller a nationally renowned expert on auto insurance and how public policy affects the industry s profits and the premiums they charge drivers heller spent nearly three months studying louisiana s auto insurance market and the laws and regulations that govern it and his findings which he presented on two separate occasions to the legislature suggest there are several ways the state could act to lower the costs of car insurance premiums unlike the proposal pushed by labi the solutions outlined by heller have all been empirically proven to work despite their claims to the contrary the truth is that the insurance industry continually hits their profit targets in louisiana year after year they re not hurting far from it in fact indeed the proposal that labi outlined which was carried by state rep kirk talbot s hb 372 would ve resulted in only one thing for certain millions more in taxpayer spending every year heller s innovative idea is actually quite simple enforce existing regulations that are designed to protect consumers and enact laws that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against drivers on the basis of their credit score and gender and prevent companies from penalizing widows widowers and those reentering the marketplace like returning military veterans if the legislature is seriously concerned about lowering premiums and not lining the pockets and rigging the system in favor of the insurance industry then the conversation should begin with insurance and not tort reform most embarrassing quote lane grigsby alexandria native lane grigsby made his fortune and a name for himself 125 miles away from his childhood home on thornton court arriving in baton rouge for good after his new bride and their new baby made it impossible for him to remain at west point aside from a profile in the town talk several years ago grigsby had been largely forgotten in alexandria his construction company cajun industries didn t do much work in central louisiana and even though he emerged as a prominent republican megadonor more than two decades ago he largely stayed out of the area s politics as well this year however lane grigsby became known across the state and in the city of his birth he finally made a name for himself not as boo s son or as the hometown boy who struck it rich but as a smug conniving and brazenly unethical partisan radical who attempted to bribe lie and buy his way to the top of state government not as a kingfish but as a kingmaker four years ago recognizing before many others in the louisiana gop that david vitter s gubernatorial campaign was doomed grigsby asked for and received a refund of the 100 000 donation he d made to vitter s pac and along with his close friend and fellow construction magnate eddie rispone he poured a fortune into electing a slate of like minded candidates to the state board of elementary and secondary education bese no one had ever before spent as much on bese elections and with the state s attention squarely focused on the top of the ticket nearly all of the candidates supported by grigsby and rispone won their races they had effectively ensured that they would both possess disproportionate influence over state education policy or at the very least the ability to force a stalemate over changing education policy both grigsby and rispone were outspoken supporters of school privatization initiatives and funneling taxpayer dollars to vocational training tailor made to fit the workforce needs of their construction companies a couple of years later the two men decided to embark on another electoral project they began actively attempting to recruit a candidate willing to run against incumbent gov john bel edwards this as it turned out was easier said than done no one of their shortlist was interested in the gig steve scalise their top choice was adamant about staying put in congress where he currently serves as house minority whip and the interview they had with u s rep ralph abraham had left them unimpressed afterward grigsby couldn t even remember abraham s name referring to him as abramson that s around the time that a sleep deprived rispone decided that god himself wanted him to run for governor eddie rispone would spend millions of his own fortune directly on the campaign and his friend lane grigsby would spend his millions through a shadowy constellation of pacs and nonprofits he d created to support rispone through negative advertising against edwards grigsby s primary beneficiary was a 501 c 4 he founded called ironically truth in politics truth in politics had intermittently published a website that was designed to resemble a news organization but their real debut was a commercial that aired stateside that featured juanita bates washington a former aide to gubernatorial assistant johnny anderson in the commercial washington who goes by several different aliases and had collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax liens and a string of disgruntled former colleagues inaccurately implied that she was fired from her job by the governor after credibly accusing anderson of sexual harassment notably washington s attorney jill craft who negotiated a settlement on her behalf subsequently issued a public endorsement of john bel edwards and after making a splash with the commercial a public records lawsuit and a press conference during the jungle primary truth in politics lost interest in washington in the runoff campaign their next ad which inaccurately claimed that one of edwards college classmates had been given a lucrative multi million dollar state contract was ordered to be taken off the air but grigsby s award winning quote i m a kingmaker i talk from the throne actually had nothing to do with the governor s race at least directly when it looked as if there could be a rare three way runoff election for a state senate seat in baton rouge which included two republican candidates and one democrat grigsby attempted to convince one of the two republican candidates to drop out in exchange for a promise of future financial support when grigsby s offer made headlines it was met with bipartisan outrage and in a moment of candor grigsby lashed out proving himself to be even more of megalomaniac than he appeared and reinforcing the belief among many that eddie rispone if elected governor would merely be a proxy for his buddy the self anointed kingmaker dis honorable mention for most embarrassing statement i am a person of myself eddie rispone biggest liar jeff landry it took nearly two weeks before general landry as he calls himself realized that the campaign commercial he had been airing statewide contained one glaring error the word louisiana was misspelled it s a fitting metaphor for how he had led the state department of justice during the past four years landry has certainly provided us with plenty of material his creation of a phony police force to arrest people in the french quarter for smoking pot the official looking badges he handed out to his friends and campaign donors his apparent contravention of state policy on travel reimbursements his clearly politicized and ultimately fruitless investigation into latoya cantrell s city credit card and his use of federal hud fair housing funds to purchase thousands of pens and plastic go cups with his name on them among other things but the reason landry deserves this year s biggest liar award is because of another glaring inaccuracy that appears in his campaign commercial to be sure it s something said about him not something said by him directly though that s a distinction without much of a difference given that it was still his commercial last year jeff landry joined ken paxton the disgraced texas attorney general who is still awaiting trial after being indicted in 2015 with two securities fraud felonies in a suit over the constitutionality of obamacare s individual mandate the u s supreme court in a majority opinion written by chief justice john roberts had previously ruled that the individual mandate was constitutional under the tax and spending clause even though most legal scholars had believed the more compelling constitutional rationale was located in the commerce clause eventually a republican led congress effectively eliminated the penalties imposed against people who do not comply with the law s individual mandate which provided landry paxton and other far right republican attorneys general to challenge the law again the central premise of their argument is that because the penalty has been reduced to nothing the individual mandate should no longer be considered constitutional under the tax and spending clause hoping for a favorable ruling landry and paxton filed the suit in the northern district of texas it s a tactic known as forum shopping and as predicted the judge agreed sending the case to the conservative fifth circuit court of appeal recently a divided three judge panel in the fifth circuit agreed with the district court s ruling but sent the case back to texas for a clarification on whether or not the individual mandate is severable or removable from the affordable care act or if the entire law should be held unconstitutional it s important to emphasize landry s objective isn t just to have an unenforced penalty be declared unconstitutional he hopes to convince the court to throw out the entire affordable care act and importantly that d also mean ending legal protections for people with pre existing conditions landry didn t bother to worry himself or the legislature about how to ensure louisiana kept the widely popular provisions that guarantee insurance companies cannot discriminate against people with pre existing conditions that means if jeff landry is ultimately successful his efforts could be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people in louisiana so what did landry s commercial claim why did he think he deserved to be reelected according to a teenager named bella who suffers from cystic fibrosis and her mother apparently jeff landry somehow guaranteed protections for people with pre existing conditions the precise opposite of what his lawsuit intends to do
erasing the eelam victory part 10d kamalika pieris rehabilitation and resettlement would help to erase the eelam victory keerawella observed in 2013 that despite the practical constraints the government was able to send most of the idps back to their villages within a period of one and a half years in 2013 the media reported that 1299 families in valikaman north had been resettled and that 12 000 were counseled and reintegrated into society some have entered universities we have even started resettling second generation of idps the government said in 2013 sri lanka army said in 2014 that 98 of the idp displaced due to the war had been re settled the inmates were sent to their families most of them have families we reintegrate people only when have an address of known relatives we locate them and then only we reintegrate them to society said the army this is being done by the military intelligence we provide them with the information given by the inmate so they are going back to the people they know there is no case of any individual being released without background being checked said the army these individuals were not just cast adrift observed michael roberts the process of resettlement was organized with the cooperation of international organization for migration iom iom has been heavily involved in financially supporting the resettlement of civilian idps from the menik farm and other camps ioc has been a conduit for monies channelled from the governments of usa australia netherlands norway japan and uk australia provided funds through ausaid department of immigration and citizenship australia diac became one of the agencies working through iom the returnees were helped to re start their lives most were in kilinochchi and mullaitivu districts most were working as laborers machine operators carpenters and so on commissioner general of rehabilitation stated that the government had given loans up to rs 250 000 at low interest to 1800 ltte cadres for approved self employment projects payment was through a bank local banks were asked to grant low interest loans with grace periods and a repayment period of ten years arrangements had also been made to get them employment in middle east iom used donor funds to provide the returnees with equipment and tool kits the private sector gave three wheelers un special rapporteur on human rights of internally displaced persons idps was satisfied with the work on resettlement of idps in north and east not everybody agreed with this assessment a study conducted by de croos 2011 explored the subjective experiences of 15 former detainees it showed an alarming picture said roberts several stated that they had received little training not all had received ids and everyone had been instructed to seek permission if they travelled beyond their village all ex detainees stated that the cid and army visited their homes at least once a week or once every fortnight and checked on their whereabouts and details groundviews 2012 spoke of the bitter end to menik farm throughout august and september 2012 people from puthukudiyiruppu and maritimepattu divisions in the mullaitivu district who had been living in menik farm were dumped in schools and roadsides to find their own way home home was mainly shrub jungles open air spaces under trees and destroyed houses with doors windows roofing and toilet equipment were looted some had to seek shelter in churches and schools as their home was simply not habitable another group we met had been compelled to stay in a small church as the army was occupying their land clearly the government which had waited for more than three years to send these people home were now in a might hurry to send them home without even clearing up jungles yahapalana also disputed the rosy position given by the mahinda rajapaksa government there are a lot of things that we ought to do in the north and east especially and what we have done so far is building roads and infrastructure but there is a lot more that we need to do to ensure these people are able to get on their own feet and survive said yahapalana in 2016 sampanthan

families were temporarily resettled in their own land and 721 families were yet to be resettled from 29 welfare centers a further 8 987 families needing resettlement were living with friends and relatives yahapalana found that it was not possible to send the idps back to their original homes though the military had released 3 800 acres of privately owned lands back to their owners because there were no houses 170 000 houses were needed that included 60 000 houses for idps who have lost all their properties during the 3 decades of conflict said yahapalana in 2018 yahapalana planned initially to provide steel prefabricated dwellings from arcelor mittal but this was objected to as most unsuitable the plan was discarded in 2018 cabinet approval was given for the construction of 25 000 houses for the north and east under the first phase of this project 15 000 houses would be constructed giving priority to the internally displaced and those who have been living as refugees in india and are returning to the country then in 2019 yahapalana said that it could not allocate money for this but would set aside around rs 8 billion in the forthcoming budget to fund 7 000

batticaloa and trincomalee district in the eastern province too there was landlessness in the north 15 639 people were registered as landless in the jaffna district alone in 2018 landlessness is an issue all over the north and east but it is most marked in the jaffna district where the population is high and state owned land is scarce some are on temple land others on private land in 2018 yahapalana made a special arrangement to provide rs 400 000 to buy a land and rs 800 000 to construct a house for each extended family living in welfare camps in jaffna in the same year yahapalana announced that government land has been divided and allocated to 25 families at keerimalai twenty five houses have already been constructed in these lands with the local funding and distributed among

families borrowing loans at high rates of interest simply to survive loans are taken by mostly women to start a small business buy a few cattle or chickens to earn an income for the family due to restrictions from state banks to get loans micro finance companies offering high interest loans have taken advantage of the situation these micro finance companies are thriving mostly in kilinochchi and mullaitivu these micro finance companies were charging as high as 300 per cent interest this is in addition to a fine when repayments accumulate micro finance company employees go to the homes of clients at night to collect the installment they use abusive language the borrowers are committing suicide families have broken up from the social unrest arising out of the inability to repay loans said the northerners these insensitive micro finance companies must be brought under control they said residents urged that these finance companies should be banned from kilinochchi mullaitivu and jaffna pyramid type businesses are also springing up in the north they said sri lanka s central bank will evolve a programme to help the country s war affected communities tackle the mounting pressure of household debt promised yahapalana central bank was considering a three pronged strategy a moratorium increasing the maturity of the loans and exploring how interest rates can be reduced thereafter

stocks buy em bonds back up the truck gold why not hogs sure there s usually a tension across financial markets if risky investments such as stocks or junk bonds are doing well super safe assets such as government securities might be terrible investments wall street s titans and armchair investors alike expend tremendous amounts of time and sweat trying to predict what will be in and what will be out hoping to beat everyone else with a cleverly constructed portfolio this year however a simpler strategy would have worked buy almost anything the s p 500 index was up 28 5 per cent through monday its best performance since 2013 and one of the best in decades broad indexes of the u s bond markets are up nearly 9 per cent gold jumped 18 5 per cent and silver nearly 16 per cent and other commodities were also up futures prices for hogs in case that had been your pick gained about 18 per cent it was a remarkable across the board rally of a scale not seen in nearly a decade the cause mostly a head spinning reversal by the federal reserve which went from planning to raise interest rates to cutting them and pumping fresh money into the financial markets rarely in my career has everything worked simultaneously said mark vaselkiv chief investment officer for fixed income at the asset management firm t rowe price analysts at ned davis research tracked eight types of investments large and small domestic stocks developed and emerging market stocks treasuries corporate bonds commodities and real estate going back to 1972 in 2019 all eight generated profits and for the first time since 2010 each rose 5 per cent or more in fact the gains were much better than that with a median gain of 21 per cent for the eight asset classes the nasdaq composite index is up more than 30 per cent its best showing since 2013 small cap stocks are up nearly 24 per cent their best gains since 2013 the more than 14 gain for high quality u s corporate bonds is the best showing since 2009 european shares up 23 per cent are likewise having their best year in a decade those gains can have a knock on effect on the economy outside wall street creating a feedback loop that helps encourage more buying the rally in bond prices which move in the opposite direction from yields has helped keep borrowing costs low for companies municipalities and the federal government and the stock market s surge is supporting spending by consumers who are the main driver of growth in the u s economy not everyone benefits when markets rise like this some investors bet on certain markets to fall either because they think they re due for a drop or because they expect that the traditional relationships among different assets where some go up so others go down will help them hedge their portfolios and we should note that not absolutely everything rose in 2019 natural gas was a losing bet so was cobalt and even a rising stock market contains more than a few sinking ships macy s for instance dropped more than 40 per cent in 2019 there s little reason to assume that these kinds of uniform gains will continue usually different investments are driven by different kinds of dynamics stock prices for example have climbed at a faster clip than expectations for profit growth that means the market is looking more and more overvalued if corporate profits don t catch up stocks could stumble and while bond markets have soared increasing loads of corporate debt could prompt investors to sell if they think these companies are taking on too much risk one factor behind the rise in bond prices in 2019 was a growing worry about the impact of the trade war even though the trade war isn t over washington and beijing have reduced the tension between them and the economy isn t faring as poorly as people had feared good for stocks but bad for bonds but for now concerns about such market fundamentals seem set squarely on the back burner after the fed reinvigorated risk taking in the markets by cutting interest rates three times out of concern that the trade war and a global growth slowdown would drag the u s economy lower the cuts were an about face for the fed which in 2018 raised interest rates four times and unnerved financial markets along the way in fact instead of the rise in asset prices that investors enjoyed in 2019 the previous year was marked by a uniform decline reflecting worries that higher interest rates and the trade war would tip the economy into a recession the central bank also started to buy securities again in 2019 pumping about us 60 billion into the financial markets every month while the most recent round of purchases has been billed as a technical fix instead of one meant to bolster the economy bond buying programs put in place after the financial crisis were widely credited for driving markets up sharply for much of the past decade similar moves by the fed aimed at shoring up economic growth helped supercharge returns in financial markets most close observers think this is precisely what happened in 2019 when people look back on this year they ll say the fed did this said evan brown head of multiasset strategy at ubs

new york icis economists and analysts largely expect 2020 to be a year of slow growth however signs of stabilisation on the manufacturing front coupled with an apparent us china phase one trade deal are spurring optimism on the outlook for chemicals manufacturing continues to be the weak spot in the global economy with the us and europe in contraction mode and china showing a mild recovery the us ism manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi dipped to 48 1 in the november reading down from 48 3 in october and the fourth consecutive month in contraction territory below 50 the ihs markit eurozone manufacturing pmi rebounded to 46 9 in november from 45 9 in october but remains mired in contraction for the 10th straight month china is showing signs of life with the caixin china general manufacturing pmi ticking up to 51 8 in november from 51 7 in october marking the fourth consecutive month in expansion territory above 50 the recovery was confirmed by the official china manufacturing pmi which broke into expansion for the first time since april the official pmi reflects mainly large state owned enterprises while the caixin index represents more small to mid size companies global growth will remain soft over the next two years as the global economy continues to slow toward a lower long term trend business sentiment across major economies has become downbeat amid elevated trade policy uncertainty said analysts at moody s investors service in the credit ratings agency s 2020 2021 global macro outlook report moody s does not expect a global recession in 2020 or 2021 however the current economic environment makes the global economy more vulnerable to negative developments analysts said even with an apparent phase one trade deal between the us and china trade remains at the top of potential risks the impact of trade disputes largely emanating from the us could linger far longer than many expect although a partial trade agreement between the us and china would signify progress in reducing tensions it would not in our view substantially reduce the prevalent trade uncertainty that is weighing on business decisions said the moody s analysts barring a catastrophic event the us and the global economy should see slow growth in 2020 with us chemical sector performance reflecting the muted outlook according to economists at the american chemistry council acc definitely a slowdown is occurring with a recoupling of global economies to the downside the manufacturing downturn is more pronounced in developed regions such as the us and europe but it does appear this is bottoming out said kevin swift chief economist of the acc the consensus is that 2020 will be another year of slow growth barring an unforeseen event with the us economy strengthening in the latter half of 2020 to 2021 he added the acc sees us gdp growth of 1 8 in 2020 down from an estimated 2 3 in 2019 and 2 9 in 2018 that s against a backdrop of global gdp growth of 2 6 in 2020 flat versus 2019 and down from 3 1 in 2018 us chemical production volumes are projected to edge up just 0 4 in 2020 after a slight 0 6 gain in 2019 volume growth has slowed dramatically from the 4 1 registered in 2018 source american chemistry council on a dollar basis us chemical shipments should gain 2 4 to 569 1bn in 2020 after weak 0 5 growth in 2019 that s down from a robust 6 1 growth rate in 2018 key us chemical end markets are expected to be flat to down in 2020 the acc expects us light vehicle sales to fall to 16 5m units in 2020 from 16 9m in 2019 with us housing starts flat at 1 26m us china trade tensions chief among the culprits of the weak performance is the us china trade war a phase one deal announced on 13 december saw the us scrap additional 15 tariffs planned on around 125bn in chinese imports that would have gone into place on 15 december the us will further cut 15 tariffs on about 120bn in chinese imports to 7 5 which went into effect on 1 september this deal impacts the fourth round of us tariffs on chinese imports however us tariffs of 25 on around 250bn in chinese imports implemented in the first three rounds will remain in place trade tensions have created tremendous uncertainty and curbed investment while exports of manufactured goods have been hit said martha moore senior director policy analysis and economics at the acc in addition to the estimated 136 7bn of direct us chemical exports in 2019 around 49bn of chemicals are included in us manufacturing and agricultural exports she noted us chemical exports of 136 7bn in 2019 are set to decline 2 5 from 2018 before ticking up 1 1 to 138 2m in 2020 imports are also set to decline by 3 9 to 104 8bn in 2019 before rising 1 2 to 138 2bn in 2020 according to the acc source american chemistry council the export side has been hit significantly with china s retaliatory tariffs and the slowdown in global manufacturing said moore the acc s assumptions for its projections include a stabilisation of us china trade tensions which includes a phase one trade deal the economists noted if you want to build a new plant that you d run for 25 30 years and plan to export 50 70 of the production how do you plan for that amid the trade uncertainty said swift so far us chemical capital investment capex continues to chug along industry capex is projected to rise a robust 4 8 in 2020 after a similar gain in 2019 and up from 4 0 in 2018 according to the acc the us shale gas advantage underpins the us chemical outlook the outlook would be very different under the same conditions without shale gas said moore the trade uncertainty has slammed manufacturing pmis purchasing managers indexes but is also now impacting services pmis noted the economists the ism us non manufacturing pmi reading in november fell to 53 9 from 54 7 in october the us manufacturing pmi in november fell to 48 1 from 48 3 in october both readings came in below expectations the risk is that a prolonged us china trade war and more tariffs stifle business investment and hiring so far that has not happened as evidenced by us nonfarm payrolls expanding by 266 000 in november versus the consensus estimate of 187 000 however the risk remains on the table the next recession could potentially be the first policy induced recession in modern times said swift recession odds low despite the softness in global manufacturing and trade tensions not just between the us and china but between the us and other countries there is a relatively low probability of a us economic recession the acc economists said the acc s chemical activity barometer cab is meant to do exactly that as a leading indicator of the overall us economy the cab reading for november was stable 0 0 change on a three month moving average basis following a 0 3 percent decline in october source american chemistry council the cab would have to decline for three consecutive months and register a cumulative decline of 3 we are not even halfway there yet but the cab is indeed suggesting a slowdown said swift however a resolution of the us china trade war could add another multi year leg to the economic expansion 2018 saw a surge in activity but then the trade war threw the equivalent of a heavy wet blanket on the economy said swift one of the causes of the downturn has been uncertainty on trade if that s taken away the strong fundamentals take over said moore us recession fears rampant in the summer after the inversion of the 10 year and two year treasury yield curve and weakening pmi data have largely faded amid signs of stability including in global pmis along with strong us jobs growth this is reflected in equity markets hitting all time highs nabe forecasts the national association for business economics nabe sees no recession in 2020 for the us economy with gdp growth of 1 8 however it is still a topic of debate especially with the us economic expansion now headed into its 11th year and the longest on record the panel is split regarding when the next recession will begin said nabe survey chair eugenio aleman economist at wells fargo respondents believe the odds that gdp will first turn downward by mid 2020 are about one out of five but indicate there is a one third chance that the downturn will not begin until the second half of 2021 or later he added the upshot is that as projections go further out in time the odds of a us recession go up the nabe panellists put the odds of a recession starting by mid 2021 at 66 versus just 21 by the first half of 2020 and 43 by the end of 2020 among the nabe panellists 71 believe that the balance of risks is to the downside with trade policy both the greatest downside and upside risk to the us economy through 2020 amid the trade uncertainty investment in the us economy is expected to slow the nabe forecasts nonresidential fixed investment to rise just 1 7 in 2020 after an estimated 2 3 gain in 2019 this is down significantly from a 6 4 increase in 2018 which was driven by the us tax cuts clearly there is significant risk coming from tariffs but we don t really see this pushing the us into recession more significant is if consumer income growth decelerates tariffs focused on consumer goods would be material but not critical said yelena shulyateva senior us economist at bloomberg intelligence and nabe panelist soft landing scenario moody s sees the fundamentals solid enough to engineer a soft landing for the global economy in 2020 2021 overall our projections assume a soft landing and stabilisation of the global economy there is a good chance that the combination of strong labour markets rising wages household sentiment and central bank policies in the us and europe will help steady the global economy at a low growth rate said analysts at moody s central banks in advanced economies remain focused on fostering economic conditions that would elongate the expansion because unemployment rates have fallen to historically low levels without significant wage and inflationary pressures central banks can further ease monetary policy without jeopardising their mandates they added however the outlook for chemicals is less sanguine our 2020 outlook for the north american and emea europe middle east and asia chemical industry is negative because of global weakness in industrial demand and the potential for a further decline in demand in 2020 said moody s analysts moody s expects average earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda in its north american and emea chemical companies under coverage to decline 5 in 2020 the ratings agency sees weak industrial and consumer demand in europe and weak industrial demand in china and north america however for the specialty chemicals sector lower commodity prices should offset some of the negative effect of lower volumes for china in particular moody sees weaker demand in the automotive construction and electronics sectors and stable consumer demand meanwhile benefits of environmental enforcement will start to be offset by new commodity capacity focus article by joseph chang

if the legislature decides not to adopt a potency based or tiered ad valorem cannabis tax we nevertheless recommend that the legislature eliminate the cultivation tax in this case we recommend that the legislature set the retail excise tax rate somewhere in the range of 15 percent to 20 percent depending on its policy preferences set specific tax rate for a potency based or tiered ad valorem tax we recommend that the legislature specify the details of the tax structure in consultation with scientific experts such expertise informed by the state s track and trace data is crucial for determining key details currently available information suggests that a potency based tax in the range of 0 006 to 0 009 per milligram of thc could be appropriate if the legislature prioritizes reducing the illicit market it may prefer a rate closer to the lower end of this range if on the other hand it prioritizes raising revenues it may prefer a rate closer to the higher end specify taxed event and point of collection to match type of tax after the legislature chooses the type of cannabis tax it wants to levy we recommend that it specify the taxed event and point of collection to facilitate tax administration and compliance for example for an ad valorem tax tiered or basic we recommend levying the tax on the retail sale and collecting it from the retailer replace existing taxes with potency based or tiered ad valorem tax we view reducing harmful use as the most compelling reason to levy an excise tax accordingly we recommend that the legislature replace the existing retail excise tax and cultivation tax with a potency based or tiered ad valorem tax as these taxes could reduce harmful use more effectively if policymakers value ease of administration and compliance more highly than reducing harmful use however the legislature might prefer to keep the existing retail excise tax in contrast we see little reason for the legislature to retain the weight based cultivation tax rate changes would create trade offs among three goals any tax rate change would help the state meet certain goals while likely making it harder to achieve others on one hand for example reducing the tax rate would expand the legal market and reduce the size of the illicit market on the other hand such a tax cut would reduce revenue in the short term potentially to the extent that revenue could be insufficient furthermore lower tax rates could lead to higher rates of youth cannabis use with a thriving illicit market however much of the cannabis used by youth could avoid taxation where possible this report provides quantitative estimates of the short term effects of rate changes we summarize these estimates along with assessments of revenue sufficiency in the figure below choice of taxed event and point of collection depends on type of tax we assess several options for specifying the tax event and point of collection for state cannabis taxes tax administration and compliance work best when the connection between the taxed event and the point of collection is very close when taxpayers are highly visible to the public and when there is a small number of taxpayers trade offs exist among tax types but weight based taxes generally weakest we analyze four types of taxes basic ad valorem set as a percentage of price such as the current retail excise tax weight based such as the current cultivation tax potency based for example based on tetrahydrocannabinol and tiered ad valorem set as a percentage of price with different rates based on potency and or product type our analysis focuses primarily on three main criteria 1 effectiveness at reducing harmful use 2 revenue stability and 3 ease of administration and compliance no individual type of tax performs best on all criteria for example tiered ad valorem and potency based likely are best for reducing harmful use but basic ad valorem is easiest to administer given these trade offs the legislature s choice depends heavily on the relative importance it places on each criterion that said the weight based tax is generally weakest performing similarly to or worse than the potency based tax on the three main criteria choices about tax structure should precede choice of tax rate before determining the specific tax rates to impose we encourage the legislature first to address two critical decisions 1 choosing what type of tax to impose on cannabis and 2 choosing which type of transaction to tax known as the taxed event and who should remit the tax known as the point of collection these choices can have effects on the three goals identified by the measure as well as other important considerations proposition 64 created two state excise taxes on cannabis proposition 64 established two state excise taxes on cannabis the first is a 15 percent retail excise tax effectively a wholesale tax under current law the second is a tax based on the weight of harvested plants often called a cultivation tax the measure authorizes the legislature to amend its tax provisions without voter approval but the scope of this authorization is unclear report required by proposition 64 proposition 64 2016 directed our office to submit a report to the legislature by january 1 2020 with recommendations for adjustments to the state s cannabis tax rate to achieve three goals 1 undercutting illicit market prices 2 ensuring sufficient revenues are generated to fund the types of programs designated by the measure and 3 discouraging youth use this report responds to this statutory requirement and discusses other potential changes to the state s cannabis taxes while this report focuses on cannabis taxes nontax policy changes also could affect these goals in november 2016 california voters approved proposition 64 which legalized the nonmedical use of cannabis typically called recreational or adult use and created a structure for regulating and taxing it proposition 64 also directed our office to submit a report to the legislature by january 1 2020 with recommendations for adjustments to the state s tax rate on cannabis to achieve three goals undercutting illicit market prices ensuring sufficient revenues are generated to fund the types of programs designated in the measure and discouraging use by persons younger than 21 years of age this report responds to that requirement specifically we provide 1 background information on cannabis and its legalization in california 2 a discussion of the effects of adjusting the tax rate 3 an assessment of other potential changes to california s cannabis tax structure and 4 recommendations for the legislature cannabis plant contains various compounds the cannabis plant contains a variety of compounds known as cannabinoids while there are over 100 known cannabinoids the most well known cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol thc and cannabidiol cbd experts regard thc as the primary psychotropic component of cannabis responsible for much of the intoxicating high reported by cannabis users in contrast cbd generally is understood not to be intoxicating depending on factors such as the specific strain of the cannabis plant as well as growing and harvesting conditions some cannabis plants have much higher levels of thc and or cbd than others very low thc cannabis is often regarded as a distinct crop known as hemp hereafter we use the term cannabis to refer to the non hemp generally higher thc version of the plant and to the products made from it wide variety of cannabis products available historically the most common method for consuming cannabis has been smoking the plant s flower while this is still very common there also are a variety of other types of cannabis products such products include edibles such as candy and beverages concentrates such as wax which has a texture similar to candle wax vapor cartridges and topicals these products have different properties such as the amount of time until they take effect the duration of their effects the concentration of thc in the product commonly known as potency and the amount of thc ultimately absorbed by the body for example it generally takes longer for users to feel the effects of edible cannabis products than smoked products and the effects of edibles tend to last longer additionally concentrates are typically much more potent than flower on average around 70 percent thc compared to around 20 percent thc some cannabis products contain significant amounts of cbd but very little thc cannabis has become more potent over time evidence suggests that the average potency of cannabis has increased in recent years there appear to be two contributing factors to the increase in potency first cultivators have bred cannabis plants for higher thc concentrations second concentrates and other high potency products make up an increasing share of the cannabis market key effects of cannabis researchers current understanding of the health effects of cannabis is far from complete that said evidence indicates that cannabis provides health benefits to those with certain conditions such as chronic pain and nausea from chemotherapy however there also is evidence of potential harms from cannabis use for example some research suggests links between cannabis use and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia additionally cannabis use can impair driving particularly when combined with alcohol use in 2017 the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine assessed the available research on the effects of cannabis figure 1 summarizes some of the key findings of that report the negative effects of cannabis appear to be greatest for high thc products high frequency use and use by certain sensitive groups such as youth figure 1 summary of cannabis effects and associations as assessed by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicinea conclusive evidence substantial evidence effective treatment for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting chronic pain treatment in adults patient reported multiple sclerosis spasticity symptoms statistical association between cannabis or cannabinoid use andb development of schizophrenia or other psychoses worse respiratory symptoms and more chronic bronchitis episodes long term smoking increased risk of motor vehicle crashes lower birth weight of offspring with maternal smoking under federal law it is illegal to possess or use cannabis currently the u s department of justice us doj does not prosecute most cannabis users and businesses that follow state and local cannabis laws if those laws are consistent with us doj priorities such as preventing cannabis from being exported to other states despite federal law california and many other states have taken steps to legalize and regulate cannabis in the past few decades however these states have not been able to include exported cannabis in these efforts due to federal prohibitions in california exports likely account for a large share of california grown cannabis roughly 80 percent by some recent estimates proposition215 1996 legalized medical cannabis in 1996 california became the first state to legalize cannabis for medical use when voters approved proposition 215 while proposition 215 legalized the medical use of cannabis it did not create a statutory framework for regulating or taxing it as a result for roughly 20 years after the measure passed most regulation and taxation of medical cannabis in california happened at the local level through ordinances and permit requirements like other businesses medical cannabis businesses were subject to broad based state taxes such as income taxes and sales taxes in recent years the legislature passed a series of laws most notably in 2015 chapter 688 ab 243 wood chapter 689 ab 266 bonta and chapter 719 sb 643 mcguire to provide a statutory framework to regulate medical cannabis proposition64 legalized adult use cannabis in november 2016 california voters approved proposition 64 at the time washington colorado oregon and alaska were the only states that had legalized cannabis for adult use under proposition 64 adults 21 years of age or older can legally grow possess and use cannabis for nonmedical purposes with certain restrictions since the passage of proposition 64 the legislature has passed laws amending the measure including chapter 27 of 2017 sb 94 committee on budget and fiscal review which brought the state s medical and adult use regulatory structures into conformity current structure for state cannabis regulation and taxation under proposition 64 state agencies issue licenses to several types of cannabis businesses including cultivators manufacturers distributors testing labs and retailers the relationships among these businesses can vary figure 2 illustrates an example to hold a state license cannabis businesses must pay fees and meet numerous other requirements including ones related to security protocols product testing and product labeling for example cannabis products must be tested for thc and cbd content before the last distributor transfers the products to the retailer additionally state licensed businesses must participate in the state s track and trace system by attaching unique identifier tags similar to bar codes to each plant and product these tags allow the state to track the movement of cannabis products through the entire supply chain from cultivation all the way to retail sale local governments may regulate ban and tax cannabis proposition 64 authorizes local governments to impose requirements on cannabis businesses to limit where they can locate or to ban them altogether additionally local governments may impose fees and taxes on cannabis which we discuss further below legislature may make some changes to the measure the california constitution does not allow the legislature to amend a measure passed by the voters unless the measure itself authorizes the legislature to do so proposition 64 authorizes the legislature to amend the measure s tax provisions with a two thirds vote these changes must be consistent with the measure s intent and further its purposes in many cases whether a proposed change to proposition 64 would meet these criteria and therefore whether the legislature could enact it without a statewide vote is unclear proposition64 imposes two state excise taxes on cannabis like other businesses cannabis businesses generally must pay broad based taxes such as income taxes and sales taxes we further discuss sales taxes on cannabis in the nearby box additionally as shown in figure 3 proposition 64 established two state excise taxes on cannabis the first is a 15 percent excise tax on retail gross receipts the second is a cultivation tax on harvested plants as of january 1 2020 the cultivation tax rates are 9 65 per ounce of dried flowers 2 87 per ounce of dried leaves and 1 35 per ounce of fresh plants the california department of tax and fee administration cdtfa which administers these cannabis taxes adjusts the cultivation tax rates annually for inflation sales taxes on cannabis sales taxes apply to tangible goods including cannabis california s state and local governments levy a sales and use tax commonly known as a sales tax on retail sales of tangible goods the rate varies across the state ranging from 7 25 percent to 10 5 percent with a statewide average of 8 6 percent cannabis products are tangible goods so their retail sale generally is subject to this tax legislative analyst s office definition of cannabis taxes does not include sales tax we define cannabis taxes to include taxes or tax rates that apply primarily to cannabis we chose this definition which does not include the sales tax for two reasons first as discussed in our 2018 report taxation of sugary drinks changes in excise tax rates such as cannabis tax rates primarily affect the price of one specific type of good relative to the prices of other items that consumers buy the sales tax applies to a wide range of goods so it does not have this property second as described above proposition 64 2016 requires that state cannabis tax revenues be allocated to purposes specified by the measure in contrast sales tax revenue goes to the state s general fund and to local programs regardless of whether that revenue comes from cannabis sales or sales of other goods figure 3 california s cannabis taxes tax type rate on january 1 2020 state retail excise tax ad valorem tax primarily on wholesale sales nominally 15 percent of retail price in practice for most sales administratively determined percentage of wholesale price currently 27 percent for some sales 15 percent of retail price state cultivation tax weight based tax on harvested cannabis 9 65 per ounce of dried cannabis flowers 2 87 per ounce of dried cannabis leaves 1 35 per ounce of fresh cannabis plant local taxes varies most commonly ad valorem or based on square footage varies on average roughly equivalent to a 14 percent tax on retail salesa distributors responsible for remitting state taxes cultivators and retailers bear the legal responsibility for the initial payment of the cultivation and retail excise taxes respectively however pursuant to chapter 27 final distributors rather than cultivators or retailers must remit these taxes to cdtfa resulting in a multistep payment process we explain this process below and illustrate how it works for a hypothetical manufactured product in figure 4 cultivation tax a cultivator determines the amount of cultivation tax it owes by weighing the plants it harvests it then pays this amount to a distributor when it sells or transfers the harvested plants in a case in which cannabis travels from the cultivator to just one distributor prior to retail sale that distributor remits the tax to cdtfa in many cases however such as the case illustrated in figure 4 the supply chain is more complex with multiple manufacturers and distributors handling harvested cannabis and the products derived from it in these cases each of those businesses must transfer the cultivation tax until the final distributor remits it to cdtfa a cultivator determines the amount of cultivation tax it owes by weighing the plants it harvests it then pays this amount to a distributor when it sells or transfers the harvested plants in a case in which cannabis travels from the cultivator to just one distributor prior to retail sale that distributor remits the tax to cdtfa in many cases however such as the case illustrated in figure 4 the supply chain is more complex with multiple manufacturers and distributors handling harvested cannabis and the products derived from it in these cases each of those businesses must transfer the cultivation tax until the final distributor remits it to cdtfa retail excise tax retailers generally must pay the retail excise tax to final distributors when they make wholesale purchases these distributors then remit the retail excise taxes to cdtfa retailers must make these payments before they sell the products to consumers so the tax is based directly on the wholesale price the price that retailers pay to distributors rather than the retail price the price that consumers pay to retailers pursuant to chapter 27 cdtfa sets the tax based on its estimate of the average ratio of retail prices to wholesale prices commonly known as a markup cdtfa s current markup estimate as of january 1 202 0 i s 80 p ercent due to the 15 p ercent statutory tax rate and the 80 p ercent markup estimate the current effective tax rate on wholesale gross receipts is 27 p ercent 15 p ercent x revenues go to three types of activities the state deposits the revenues from the two cannabis taxes into the cannabis tax fund proposition 64 continuously appropriates cannabis tax fund proceeds to fund three types of activities allocation 1 regulatory and administrative costs first revenues pay back certain state agencies for any cannabis regulatory and administrative costs not covered by license fees first revenues pay back certain state agencies for any cannabis regulatory and administrative costs not covered by license fees allocation 2 specified allocations second after regulatory and administrative costs are covered revenues go to certain research and other programs such as researching the effects of cannabis and the effects of the measure second after regulatory and administrative costs are covered revenues go to certain research and other programs such as researching the effects of cannabis and the effects of the measure allocation 3 percentage allocations third these revenues go to three broad types of activities 60 p ercent for youth programs related to substance use education prevention and treatment 20 p ercent for environmental programs and 20 p ercent for law enforcement unlike the other allocations funding for allocation 3 c omes from tax receipts from the prior year administration has discretion within each percentage allocation proposition 64 does not allow the administration to change the share of revenue allocated to each of the three allocation 3 categories the measure loosens these restrictions starting in 2028 however it generally authorizes the administration to choose how to allocate funding among various eligible activities within each of the three allocation 3 categories youth substance use programs environmental programs and law enforcement for example as shown in figure 5 in 2019 20 the administration s largest allocation within the substance use related youth program category was for childcare for children 13 and under 81

differs between medical and adult use cannabis state law exempts medical cannabis from certain taxes under two scenarios first under a new law that takes effect january 1 2020 chapter 837 statutes of 2019 medical cannabis products that businesses donate to consumers free of charge and that meet other conditions are exempt from the state s cannabis taxes second cannabis is exempt from state and local sales taxes if purchased for medical use with a valid state medical identification card california still in early stages of implementing regulatory structure proposition 64 required state licensing agencies such as the bureau of cannabis control to begin licensing cannabis businesses and administering cannabis excise taxes starting january 1 2018 given this time frame implementing departments have taken a multistep approach starting with temporary actions and then following up with more permanent ones as shown in figure 6 these actions include promulgating regulations the licensing departments promulgated regulations on an emergency basis in december 2017 and issued final regulations in january 2019 the final regulations specified detailed rules for how licensees must operate such as the security protocols they must follow and how they must conduct laboratory tests on cannabis products these regulations included some key decisions affecting the cannabis industry for example the regulations prohibit cities and counties from banning retail delivery of cannabis into their jurisdictions some local governments currently are challenging this regulation in the courts the licensing departments promulgated regulations on an emergency basis in december 2017 and issued final regulations in january 2019 the final regulations specified detailed rules for how licensees must operate such as the security protocols they must follow and how they must conduct laboratory tests on cannabis products these regulations included some key decisions affecting the cannabis industry for example the regulations prohibit cities and counties from banning retail delivery of cannabis into their jurisdictions some local governments currently are challenging this regulation in the courts issuing temporary licenses in january 2018 the licensing departments began issuing temporary licenses to businesses these temporary licenses allowed businesses to operate on a conditional limited term basis without paying license fees or participating in the track and trace program the last temporary licenses expired in august 2019 in january 2018 the licensing departments began issuing temporary licenses to businesses these temporary licenses allowed businesses to operate on a conditional limited term basis without paying license fees or participating in the track and trace program the last temporary licenses expired in august 2019 issuing provisional and annual licenses in september 2018 the legislature passed chapter 857 o f 2018 s b 1459 cannella which allowed the licensing departments to issue provisional cannabis licenses under certain conditions provisional licensees must pay license fees and participate in the track and trace program but they do not need to show proof of full compliance with the california environmental quality act ceqa complying with ceqa can involve a lengthy process chapter 40 o f 2019 a b 97 committee on budget extended the period in which businesses could hold provisional licenses to no later than january 2023 after which licensees will need to secure annual licenses which require full compliance with ceqa licensing agencies began issuing annual licenses in october 2018 in september 2018 the legislature passed chapter f 2018 s cannella which allowed the licensing departments to issue provisional cannabis licenses under certain conditions provisional licensees must pay license fees and participate in the track and trace program but they do not need to show proof of full compliance with the california environmental quality act ceqa complying with ceqa can involve a lengthy process chapter f 2019 a committee on budget extended the period in which businesses could hold provisional licenses to no later than january 2023 after which licensees will need to secure annual licenses which require full compliance with ceqa licensing agencies began issuing annual licenses in october 2018 requiring participation in track and trace as the temporary licenses have expired more businesses have obtained provisional or annual licenses a condition of which is that they enter certain product information into the track and trace system when we prepared this report the system still contained limited information local regulatory policies vary by jurisdiction since the passage of proposition 64 cities and counties have taken a wide variety of approaches to cannabis some local governments have licensed many cannabis businesses others have taken the opposite approach prohibiting all cannabis businesses from locating within their boundaries finally some have taken an in between approach for example licensing only medical cannabis businesses licensing only certain types of adult use cannabis businesses or capping the number of certain types of businesses such as allowing only a limited number of retailers over time there appears to be a general trend towards more local governments licensing cannabis businesses local tax policies vary by jurisdiction local governments also have taken a wide variety of approaches to taxing cannabis these approaches fall into three broad categories first many local governments impose the same tax rate on all cannabis businesses regardless of type second many local governments impose higher tax rates on retailers than other types of cannabis businesses third a few local governments license cannabis businesses but do not levy taxes specifically on cannabis although these three approaches lead to a wide range of local tax rates we estimate that the average cumulative local tax rate over the whole supply chain is roughly equivalent to a 14 percent tax on retail sales in addition to taxes many local governments also require cannabis businesses to make other payments such as fees as a condition of operating consumer access depends on delivery and local licensing we estimate that one third of californians live in cities or unincorporated areas with at least one licensed adult use retail storefront as mentioned above however state regulations allow retail delivery even into cities and counties that do not authorize cannabis businesses as a result as shown in figure 7 we estimate that about 90 percent of californians live in jurisdictions with access to at least one state licensed adult use retailer either storefront or delivery nine other states and canada have passed laws taxing adult use cannabis we summarize these taxes in figure 8 the most common type of cannabis tax is an ad valorem price based tax on retail sales and the second most common is a weight based tax on cultivation canada and illinois have tax rates that incorporate information about potency the amount of thc in a product we further describe the different types of cannabis taxes in the nearby text box figure 8 adult use cannabis taxes in other states and canada jurisdiction year implemented type s of tax key rate s on

california s current retail excise tax on cannabis are examples of ad valorem taxes weight based tax under a weight based tax the amount of tax due is based directly on the weight of the product the

cannabis product for example canada s cannabis tax system includes a rate of 0 01 canadian roughly three quarters of a cent u s per milligram of tetrahydrocannabinol thc in certain types of cannabis products hereafter we use potency based primarily to refer to this simple thc based structure however potency based taxes could take a variety of forms for example incorporating other cannabinoids in addition to thc under a potency based tax the amount of tax due depends only on the potency of the cannabis product for example canada s cannabis tax system includes a rate of 0 01 canadian roughly three quarters of a cent u s per milligram of tetrahydrocannabinol thc in certain types of cannabis products hereafter we use potency based primarily to refer to this simple thc based structure however potency based taxes could take a variety of forms for example incorporating other cannabinoids in addition to thc tiered ad valorem tax a tiered ad valorem tax is similar to the basic ad valorem tax but with multiple rates these rates could depend on potency and or the type of product for example illinois has set three different ad valorem tax rates on cannabis based on potency and product type 10 p ercent on cannabis flower and other products with thc concentrations below 35 p ercent 20 p ercent on cannabis infusions such as edibles and 25 p ercent on products with thc potency above 35 p ercent such as concentrates as noted above proposition 64 requires us to recommend adjustments to the state s cannabis tax rate to achieve three goals 1 undercutting illicit market prices 2 ensuring sufficient revenues are generated for the programs identified in the measure and 3 discouraging use by persons younger than 21 years of age in this section we discuss the effects of tax rate changes on these outcomes effects of tax rate changes illustrated with four examples by effects we refer to the difference between two outcomes 1 the outcome that would occur under a given policy choice and 2 the outcome that would occur under the current policy all else equal effects does not refer for example to year over year changes in outcomes we elaborate on this point in the appendix to make our discussion of short term effects concrete we provide estimates for four examples of potential rate changes these examples reflect recent proposals considered by the legislature and other options to provide a better sense of potential effects of changes example 1 eliminating cultivation tax and reducing retail excise rate to 11 percent bills introduced in 2018 a b 3157 lackey and 2019 a b 286 bonta proposed these rate changes bills introduced in 2018 a lackey and 2019 a bonta proposed these rate changes example 2 eliminating cultivation tax and keeping retail excise rate at 15 percent in 2019 the legislature discussed amendments to a b 286 t hat would have enacted this change in 2019 the legislature discussed amendments to a hat would have enacted this change example 3 eliminating cultivation tax and raising retail excise rate to 20 percent as discussed below we estimate that this change likely would be roughly revenue neutral in the short term as discussed below we estimate that this change likely would be roughly revenue neutral in the short term example 4 keeping current cultivation rates and raising retail excise rate to 25 percent to illustrate a range of options we round out the list of examples with a net tax increase effects uncertain particularly in the long run adult use cannabis legalization is a relatively new phenomenon so useful evidence on the effects of changing cannabis tax rates is limited as a result these effects are uncertain to varying degrees as described below we have estimated the likely short term effects of rate changes on two outcomes related to the statutory goals described above the size of the legal cannabis market and cannabis tax revenues short term refers to the first year or two after the rate change we discuss our estimation methods briefly in the appendix however available evidence does not enable us to quantify the long term effects of rate changes on those outcomes nor the short term or long term effects of rate changes on other outcomes related to the statutory goals such as the size of the illicit market and youth use instead we discuss these effects qualitatively basic relationship between taxes and relative prices cannabis tax rates directly affect the costs that legal cannabis businesses incur for selling cannabis for example if the state cut the tax rate it would become less costly for those businesses to sell cannabis as a result consumers would pay lower prices for legal cannabis the magnitude of this price change would depend on market conditions in contrast the change in tax rates would have no direct effect on the cost of selling cannabis in the illicit market the illicit market consists of commercial cannabis activity that does not comply with the regulatory structure required in law consequently a change in tax rates would affect the difference between legal and illicit prices with a tax cut making legal cannabis more competitive with illegal cannabis compared to what would be the case in the absence of a cut what does it mean to undercut the illicit market one of the goals listed in proposition 64 is to undercut illicit market prices however under current market conditions changes in the state tax rate likely would not make legal cannabis less expensive than illicit cannabis even if the state eliminated its cannabis taxes entirely other costs such as regulatory compliance costs and local taxes likely would keep legal cannabis prices higher than illicit market prices this could change if legal prices decline as they have in other states accordingly we instead consider competition between the legal and illicit cannabis markets more broadly even if legal cannabis remains more expensive than illicit cannabis any price change will affect some consumers choices which in turn affect the sizes of the legal and illicit markets in short term tax cuts expand legal market our analysis of competition between the legal and illicit markets starts with estimation of the likely short term effects of tax rate changes on the amount of cannabis purchased from the legal market as illustrated by the examples in figure 9 tax cuts would expand the legal cannabis market while tax increases would shrink it figure 9 estimated short term effects of rate changes on legal consumption and revenue cultivation tax retail excise tax likely short term percentage change in likelihood revenue would exceed thresholdb legal cannabis consumption state cannabis tax revenuea keep at current ratesc keep at current rate 15 0 0 very likely to exceed eliminate reduce to 11 6 to 20 34 to 43 likely to fall short eliminate keep at current rate 15 3 to 11 16 to 25 roughly equal chances of exceeding and falling short eliminate increase to 20 2 to 1 5 to 3 very likely to exceed keep at current rates increase to 25 7 to 22 18 to 40 very likely to exceed tax cuts reduce illicit market but size of effect is uncertain ideally we would be able to identify what proportion of the increase in legal consumption of cannabis would be due to reductions in illicit consumption substitution as opposed to increased cannabis use overall unfortunately while we suspect that tax cuts would increase substitution from the illicit market more than they would increase actual consumption we have found no evidence that would enable us to quantify these effects thus while a tax cut clearly would reduce the size of the illicit market to some extent and a tax increase would expand it we cannot quantify the extent of this effect taxes likely have little effect on exports the illicit market for california grown cannabis consists of two parts 1 cannabis sold in california and 2 cannabis exported out of the state in state sales likely account for a small share of california grown cannabis crucially exported cannabis does not compete directly with california s legal market so changing the state s cannabis tax rate likely would have little effect on it additionally as mentioned previously a key federal enforcement priority is preventing the export of cannabis to other states accordingly california and others states that have legalized cannabis do not allow licensed cannabis businesses to export cannabis out of state thus regardless of the state s tax system under current federal policies california cannot bring exported cannabis into the state s legal market long term effects highly uncertain the long term effects of rate changes on the size of the legal and illicit markets while important are highly uncertain in theory these long term effects could be substantially different from the short term effects one reason is that changes in state tax rates could affect cities and counties licensing and taxation choices which in turn would affect the size of the legal and illicit markets suppose for example that the state reduces its tax rate on the one hand local governments could respond by raising their tax rates partly offsetting the effects of the state tax cut on the other hand local governments could respond to the potential for generating greater tax revenue by licensing more cannabis businesses amplifying the market expanding effects of the state tax cut on legal consumption tax cuts reduce revenue in the short term figure 9 displays our estimates of the short term revenue effects of the four rate changes described above as directed by proposition 64 our revenue estimates focus exclusively on state cannabis tax revenues overall reducing cannabis tax rates would reduce revenues in the short term while raising rates would lead to higher revenues under current law we expect state cannabis tax revenue to be in the mid hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020 21 and 2021 22 although tax cuts would expand the legal market this effect would not be anywhere near large enough to fully offset the revenue loss modest rate increases on the other hand would raise revenue in the short term we estimate that extremely large rate increases such as an increase in the retail excise tax rate from 15 percent to 80 percent likely would reduce revenue the long term revenue effects of rate changes are highly uncertain for the same reasons that the long term effects on legal and illicit markets are uncertain what are sufficient revenues proposition 64 does not define what constitutes sufficient revenues however the measure requires the california highway patrol chp to receive at least 50 million from allocation 3 starting in 2022 23 because many other programs must receive funding prior to this allocation we estimate the state would have to collect at least 350 million in revenue in 2021 22 to meet the chp funding requirement accordingly it is reasonable to assume that 2021 22 revenue below 350 million would not be sufficient beyond this requirement it is difficult to determine what level of revenue would be sufficient we discuss these difficulties further in the nearby box sufficient revenues under proposition 64 proposition 64 2016 requires our office to make recommendations on adjustments to the tax rate in order to ensure sufficient revenues are generated for the programs identified in the measure among other goals as we discuss below there are a few key reasons why it is difficult to determine what constitutes sufficient revenues some of these challenges include the administration s flexibility in choosing which programs to fund the lack of a clear definition of sufficiency and revenue uncertainty additionally the way the measure restricts the allocation of revenues with fixed percentage allocations and no discretionary reserve makes it more difficult for the state to fund programs sufficiently with a given amount of revenue challenges in determining sufficient revenues measure provides administration discretion to allocate funds to programs the first step in determining sufficient revenue would be to identify the list of specific programs that would need to be funded the measure however does not enable us to define such a list instead it describes some broad program categories and it generally authorizes the administration to allocate funding to a variety of possible programs within those categories accordingly in practice the administration may spend these funds on a wide range of activities additionally the administration may adjust the amount of funding provided to each activity at any time as a result the amount of funding required could vary dramatically depending on the specific programs the administration chooses to fund measure lacks direct guidance on sufficiency the measure provides no direct guidance on what constitutes sufficient revenues for example the measure does not identify specific goals for the youth substance use programs such as the number of programs funded the number of individuals treated or the reduction in youth substance use disorders achieved accordingly even if the administration s future funding allocations could be predicted with certainty there still could be a variety of reasonable perspectives on what constitutes sufficient revenues for those programs future revenues uncertain another complicating factor is that even absent changes in tax rates future cannabis tax revenues are uncertain accordingly even if the legislature could direct funds to programs that target the goals specified by the measure youth substance use programs environmental programs and law enforcement and even if those goals were clear there would be significant uncertainty regarding the tax rate that would be needed to meet these goals challenges in achieving sufficient revenues restrictions in measure make it more difficult to achieve revenue sufficiency proposition 64 restricts the use of state cannabis tax revenues these restrictions make it more difficult for the state to fund programs sufficiently with a given amount of revenue primarily for two reasons percentage allocations remain fixed although proposition 64 gives the administration discretion to allocate funds within each of the three percentage allocations youth substance use environmental and law enforcement it does not authorize changes to the 60 20 20 split itself if for example overall cannabis revenue provided sufficient funding for two of those three categories but not the third neither the legislature nor the administration could reallocate cannabis revenue to the area of greatest need although proposition 64 gives the administration discretion to allocate funds within each of the three percentage allocations youth substance use environmental and law enforcement it does not authorize changes to the 60 20 20 split itself if for example overall cannabis revenue provided sufficient funding for two of those three categories but not the third neither the legislature nor the administration could reallocate cannabis revenue to the area of greatest need no discretionary reserve proposition 64 does not authorize the legislature or the administration to maintain a discretionary reserve for the cannabis tax fund such a reserve could help the state maintain sufficient programmatic funding if revenue were to decline in some years other funds could help address these challenges proposition 64 asks us to assess revenue sufficiency based only on the revenue raised by the state s cannabis taxes from a broader perspective the state could address the challenges described above by supplementing the funding for these programs with other revenues such as general fund revenues much lower rates might not yield sufficient revenue under the current tax rates we estimate that revenues are very likely to exceed the 350 million revenue threshold in 2021 22 figure 9 lists brief descriptions of the likelihood that revenues would exceed this revenue threshold under the four examples of potential rate changes higher taxes could reduce youth use depending on availability of illicit cannabis as discussed above higher taxes would reduce legal cannabis consumption but we do not know how much of this reduction would consist of substitution to the illicit market and how much would consist of reductions in actual consumption this uncertainty extends to the effects of changes to cannabis taxes on youth use if youth easily can acquire cannabis from the illicit market tax increases on legal cannabis might not substantially raise the actual prices that youth pay if taxes do not substantially raise actual prices paid by youth they very likely would have little effect on youth use that said if the illicit market becomes less active over time for example as a result of more active enforcement taxes could become a reliable tool for reducing youth use tobacco taxes provide a reference point for the relationships among tax rates illicit trade and youth substance use research shows that tobacco taxes raise tobacco prices despite significant illicit tobacco trafficking thus reducing youth tobacco use illicit sales currently play a much bigger role in california s cannabis market than in typical tobacco markets likely making illegal cannabis accessible to youth even in a scenario with relatively high tax rates that said total elimination of illicit cannabis markets likely is not a prerequisite for higher cannabis taxes to reduce youth cannabis use analysis of harmful use and medical use similar to youth use in addition to the three criteria laid out in statute we encourage the legislature to consider two additional major criteria as it weighs potential adjustments to cannabis taxes harmful use excise taxes can reduce not just youth use of cannabis but harmful use more generally as noted in the background section evidence suggests that cannabis use can have some negative effects such as increased risk of motor vehicle crashes as with youth use however the effects of cannabis taxes on harmful use likely depend on the extent to which illicit cannabis remains a readily available substitute for legal cannabis as long as illicit consumption remains common consumers of all ages face a variety of health risks due to the unregulated nature of those products also as we discuss in the next section the effects of cannabis taxes on harmful use depend not only on the tax rate but also on the type of tax excise taxes can reduce not just youth use of cannabis but harmful use more generally as noted in the background section evidence suggests that cannabis use can have some negative effects such as increased risk of motor vehicle crashes as with youth use however the effects of cannabis taxes on harmful use likely depend on the extent to which illicit cannabis remains a readily available substitute for legal cannabis as long as illicit consumption remains common consumers of all ages face a variety of health risks due to the unregulated nature of those products also as we discuss in the next section the effects of cannabis taxes on harmful use depend not only on the tax rate but also on the type of tax medical use as described in the background section cannabis can be useful for addressing certain ailments consequently an ideal system of cannabis regulation and taxation would enable the state to tax cannabis used for medical purposes at a substantially lower rate than cannabis for adult use we further compare taxes on cannabis and on medicine in a recent online post comparing taxes on cannabis to taxes on other products in california however distinguishing medical cannabis products and customers from adult use is difficult in practice this is because 1 s imilar products can be used by medical and adult use users and 2 c annabis can be used to treat a variety of conditions some of which can be difficult to verify such as chronic pain due in large part to the challenge of distinguishing medical cannabis from adult use cannabis the state generally taxes both types similarly as a result higher cannabis taxes have the potential to reduce not just youth and other harmful use but also medical use in short term rate cuts help address illicit market but reduce revenue in light of the above analysis the legislature faces trade offs when considering adjustments to the state s cannabis tax rate any tax rate change would help the state meet certain goals while likely making it harder to achieve others on one hand for example reducing the tax rate would expand the legal market and reduce the size of the illicit market on the other hand such a tax cut would reduce revenue in the short term potentially to the extent that revenue could be considered insufficient furthermore lower tax rates could lead to higher rates of youth cannabis use particularly if the state makes progress towards reining in the illicit market nontax policies also affect legal and illicit markets revenues and youth use the scope of this report is limited to state cannabis taxes these taxes however are only one of many state policies that could affect revenue the illicit market and youth use examples of other such policies include increased criminal or civil penalties for participating in the illicit cannabis market additional state or local resources devoted to enforcing state laws changes in state licensing requirements changes to local governments authority to ban cannabis businesses and resources devoted to youth education on the effects of cannabis use for instance enhanced enforcement would make it more difficult and costly for businesses to operate in the illicit market this likely would shift activity from the illicit market to the legal market thereby increasing tax revenues additionally it likely would affect youth use by making it more difficult and expensive for them to access cannabis through the illicit market basic tax policy choices should precede changes to tax rates the prior section focuses narrowly on our statutory charge of assessing the effects of adjusting tax rates taking the existing tax structure as given as discussed in that section changing cannabis tax rates could help the legislature make progress towards some of the measure s goals though there are trade offs involved the legislature could make further progress towards those goals and others by making changes not only to the tax rates but also to the basic structure of the taxes as summarized in figure 10 we encourage the legislature to approach cannabis tax policy in three steps first choosing what type of tax to impose on cannabis second choosing the taxed event and point of collection for the tax and third choosing the tax rate figure 10 setting the cannabis tax rate first decision what type of tax should the state levy basic ad valorem tax weight based tax potency based tax ad valorem tax with rate tiers based on potency and or type of product second decision what should the taxed event be and who should remit the tax taxed event options sale transfer from cultivator to first distributor sale transfer from last distributor to retailer sale from retailer to consumer point of collection options cultivator first distributor last distributor retailer third decision what should the rate be goals that favor low rates undercutting illicit market prices increasing access to medical cannabis goals that favor high rates ensuring sufficient state cannabis tax revenue discouraging youth use and harmful use particularly if state makes progress towards reining in illicit market types of taxes to consider we have identified four types of cannabis taxes that the legislature may wish to consider basic ad valorem weight based potency based and tiered ad valorem we describe these taxes further in the types of cannabis taxes to consider box above criteria to consider when choosing type of tax key criteria to consider when selecting the type of tax include harmful use as noted in the background section the negative effects of cannabis use seem to be particularly high for high potency products high frequency use and youth use to score well on this criterion a tax should impose higher costs on more harmful purchases and lower costs on less harmful purchases as noted above diminished illicit market activity would help make the tax more useful for this purpose as noted in the background section the negative effects of cannabis use seem to be particularly high for high potency products high frequency use and youth use to score well on this criterion a tax should impose higher costs on more harmful purchases and lower costs on less harmful purchases as noted above diminished illicit market activity would help make the tax more useful for this purpose raising stable revenues for any type of tax the legislature can set the rate to raise a particular amount of revenue up to a point in an average year however the revenue raised by some types of taxes could grow at rates that vary unpredictably from year to year while other taxes could raise more stable revenues the latter types score better on this criterion than the former for any type of tax the legislature can set the rate to raise a particular amount of revenue up to a point in an average year however the revenue raised by some types of taxes could grow at rates that vary unpredictably from year to year while other taxes could raise more stable revenues the latter types score better on this criterion than the former administration and compliance to score well on this criterion a tax should be relatively straightforward for tax administrators and taxpayers to implement and enforce to score well on this criterion a tax should be relatively straightforward for tax administrators and taxpayers to implement and enforce other criteria in addition to the three main criteria identified above the legislature also may wish to consider other criteria such as 1 t he extent to which a tax could help the legal market compete effectively with the illicit market 2 t he extent to which a tax would create arbitrary cost differences between very low thc cannabis products and similar hemp products 3 t he difficulty of implementing the change figure 11 summarizes our assessment of the four types of cannabis taxes based on the three main criteria identified above as we discuss below each type of cannabis tax has strengths and weaknesses and no individual type of tax performs best on all criteria accordingly the legislature s choice depends heavily on the relative importance it places on each of these criteria that said the weight based tax is generally weakest performing similarly to or worse than the potency based tax on the three main criteria reducing harmful use we rate the potency based and tiered ad valorem taxes as having the greatest potential to reduce harmful use potency based could reduce harmful use very effectively the negative effects of cannabis appear to be linked in large part to the potency of the products used accordingly a potency based tax is a direct consistent way to use taxes to discourage harmful use so it scores well on this criterion the negative effects of cannabis appear to be linked in large part to the potency of the products used accordingly a potency based tax is a direct consistent way to use taxes to discourage harmful use so it scores well on this criterion tiered ad valorem also could reduce harmful use very effectively while measured thc potency is a very important determinant of harmful use it is far from the only one other key factors include the share of thc absorbed by the body as well as other health risks such as pulmonary risks from smoking the legislature could use a tiered ad valorem tax to set higher rates not only on more potent products but also on specific product categories such as certain types of concentrates regarded as particularly harmful in this way a tiered structure could account for some of these other harmful attributes and thus also have the potential to be very effective at reducing harmful use that said the relative effectiveness of this tax depends heavily on the rate differences between tiers suppose for example that a consumer is choosing between a more harmful product and a less harmful product that fall within the same rate tier for this consumer the tiered ad valorem tax does not reduce harmful use any more effectively than a basic ad valorem tax while measured thc potency is a very important determinant of harmful use it is far from the only one other key factors include the share of thc absorbed by the body as well as other health risks such as pulmonary risks from smoking the legislature could use a tiered ad valorem tax to set higher rates not only on more potent products but also on specific product categories such as certain types of concentrates regarded as particularly harmful in this way a tiered structure could account for some of these other harmful attributes and thus also have the potential to be very effective at reducing harmful use that said the relative effectiveness of this tax depends heavily on the rate differences between tiers suppose for example that a consumer is choosing between a more harmful product and a less harmful product that fall within the same rate tier for this consumer the tiered ad valorem tax does not reduce harmful use any more effectively than a basic ad valorem tax weight based and ad valorem likely worse for reducing harmful use weight based and ad valorem taxes do not directly target high potency products and other products associated with harmful use accordingly they score less well on this criterion weight and price are related to harmful use but these relationships are complex for example the production of high potency products such as concentrates tends to require greater quantities and thus weight of cannabis however since weight based taxes apply the same tax rate to cannabis flowers regardless of their potency they tend to encourage the cultivation of higher potency cannabis additionally some evidence suggests that more potent products and products with high thc absorption rates tend to be somewhat more expensive than less potent products however for a given type of product heavy users might pay lower prices and proportionally lower ad valorem taxes than infrequent users this could happen for example if heavy users tend to obtain bulk discounts or if they tend to be more price sensitive than infrequent users furthermore price declines discussed in more detail below could reduce the effectiveness of an ad valorem tax at reducing harmful use over time if the state does not adjust the rate accordingly stable revenues we rate the weight based and potency based taxes as most effective at providing stable revenues we discuss each of the options from least effective to most ad valorem likely least stable though adjustments could help we think that cannabis prices in california likely will decline in the coming years as the cannabis market matures consistent with other states experience these potential near term price declines would tend to slow the growth of revenues generated from an ad valorem tax we expect that price declines would coincide with increases in the quantity of cannabis purchased which would somewhat offset their effects on ad valorem revenues furthermore the state could address this weakness of the ad valorem tax by adjusting the tax rate frequently to reflect price changes for example the legislature could direct cdtfa to adjust tax rates automatically based on changes in average cannabis prices while this type of adjustment could help improve the stability of ad valorem taxes it would be imperfect because it would take some time to adjust the rate and proposition 64 does not allow for reserves to help smooth out spending in the interim we think that cannabis prices in california likely will decline in the coming years as the cannabis market matures consistent with other states experience these potential near term price declines would tend to slow the growth of revenues generated from an ad valorem tax we expect that price declines would coincide with increases in the quantity of cannabis

ad valorem taxes it would be imperfect because it would take some time to adjust the rate and proposition 64 does not allow for reserves to help smooth out spending in the interim tiered ad valorem also relatively volatile like a basic ad valorem tax a tiered tax could raise volatile revenues however if the trend towards higher potency products continues then revenue from the tiered tax could grow accordingly perhaps somewhat offsetting revenue slowdowns resulting from declining prices like the ad valorem tax the state could address this weakness of the tiered ad valorem tax by adjusting the tax rate frequently to reflect price changes like a basic ad valorem tax a tiered tax could raise volatile revenues however if the trend towards higher potency products continues then revenue from the tiered tax could grow accordingly perhaps somewhat offsetting revenue slowdowns resulting from declining prices like the ad valorem tax the state could address this weakness of the tiered ad valorem tax by adjusting the tax rate frequently to reflect price changes weight based and potency based best for generating stable revenues based largely on other states experiences we generally expect total plant weight and thc produced in the legal cannabis market to be less volatile than prices accordingly weight based and potency based taxes likely would raise more stable revenues than an ad valorem tax basic or tiered administration and compliance we rate the basic and tiered ad valorem taxes as best for administration and compliance basic ad valorem best for administration and compliance the basic ad valorem tax is easier for cdtfa to administer than weight based taxes and potency based taxes cdtfa has considerable financial expertise as well as direct experience implementing ad valorem taxes such as the sales tax similarly cdtfa already has an administrative structure for auditing and enforcing payment of ad valorem taxes which makes it easier for the department to ensure compliance furthermore basic ad valorem taxes can make taxpayer compliance relatively straightforward as they often do not require businesses to collect much information beyond what they track during their normal course of business the basic ad valorem tax is easier for cdtfa to administer than weight based taxes and potency based taxes cdtfa has considerable financial expertise as well as direct experience implementing ad valorem taxes such as the sales tax similarly cdtfa already has an administrative structure for auditing and enforcing payment of ad valorem taxes which makes it easier for the department to ensure compliance furthermore basic ad valorem taxes can make taxpayer compliance relatively straightforward as they often do not require businesses to collect much information beyond what they track during their normal course of business tiered ad valorem also good for administration and compliance a tiered ad valorem tax would be somewhat more complicated to administer than a basic ad valorem tax however as long as the number of rates were relatively small a tiered ad valorem tax should not be overly difficult to administer notably cdtfa has some experience implementing tiered ad valorem rates for the alcoholic beverage tax we discuss comparisons between cannabis taxes and other excise taxes including alcoholic beverage taxes in greater detail in an accompanying online post comparing taxes on cannabis to taxes on other products in california a tiered ad valorem tax would be somewhat more complicated to administer than a basic ad valorem tax however as long as the number of rates were relatively small a tiered ad valorem tax should not be overly difficult to administer notably cdtfa has some experience implementing tiered ad valorem rates for the alcoholic beverage tax we discuss comparisons between cannabis taxes and other excise taxes including alcoholic beverage taxes in greater detail in an accompanying online post comparing taxes on cannabis to taxes on other products in california administration and compliance more difficult for weight based and potency based cdtfa does not have much expertise regarding the weight or chemical composition of products while data entered into the track and trace system could help taxpayers and the department implement a weight based or potency based tax these taxes likely still would be more difficult for the agency to administer than an ad valorem tax potency might seem like a more exotic tax base than weight but it is not clear that it would be more difficult to administer this is in part because a potency based tax has two key advantages with regard to administration and compliance first testing labs verify the potency of cannabis products as we understand it these tests rarely find substantial differences between labeled and actual cannabinoid content more commonly products fail lab tests for other reasons such as high levels of pesticides in contrast the state has not established any mechanism for consistent direct third party verification of the weight of harvested plants second thc content appears on the labels of all cannabis products allowing for further verification opportunities upon retail purchase in contrast once a cannabis product has entered the manufacturing process there is no way to verify the weight of the raw plant material used to make it other criteria below we discuss how the various types of taxes perform on some additional criteria no clear major differences in competition with illicit market as discussed above higher tax rates reduce the size of the legal cannabis market and expand the illicit market however we do not anticipate any similarly clear major effects of the type of tax on the relative strength of the legal and illicit markets as discussed above compliance could be more difficult for some types of taxes than others but the resulting effects on the size of the legal and illicit markets likely would be small as discussed above higher tax rates reduce the size of the legal cannabis market and expand the illicit market however we do not anticipate any similarly clear major effects of the type of tax on the relative strength of the legal and illicit markets as discussed above compliance could be more difficult for some types of taxes than others but the resulting effects on the size of the legal and illicit markets likely would be small potency based would reduce cost differences between cannabis and hemp products the state s cannabis taxes apply to cannabis and all of the products derived from it regardless of their thc content however these taxes do not apply to hemp or to the products derived from it as a result these taxes could create large essentially arbitrary cost differences between low thc cannabis derived products and similar hemp derived products a potency based cannabis tax could make these cost differences much smaller than a weight based tax or an ad valorem tax the state s cannabis taxes apply to cannabis and all of the products derived from it regardless of their thc content however these taxes do not apply to hemp or to the products derived from it as a result these taxes could create large essentially arbitrary cost differences between low thc cannabis derived products and similar hemp derived products a potency based cannabis tax could make these cost differences much smaller than a weight based tax or an ad valorem tax bigger changes would be harder to implement implementing major changes could involve a variety of challenges during the transition to the new tax structure for example the transition to a potency based tax would be more difficult for tax administrators and taxpayers than a minor adjustment to one of the existing taxes the legislature faces trade offs in deciding how many cannabis taxes to levy if multiple taxes have highly complementary strengths and weaknesses then a carefully chosen combination of taxes could have the potential to achieve better outcomes than one of them alone however our assessment suggests that such a combination might not exist in practice limiting the gains from levying more than one type of tax additionally levying more than one type of tax makes tax administration and compliance more burdensome and complex accordingly on balance we do not think there is a strong rationale for levying multiple types of cannabis taxes after the legislature decides what type of tax it wants to levy on cannabis the next step is to choose both the taxed event and the type of business that will remit the tax also known as the point of collection taxed event options the legislature may wish to considering levying a cannabis tax at any of three points in the supply chain the sale or transfer of harvested cannabis from the cultivator to the first distributor the sale or transfer of cannabis products from the last distributor to the retailer the sale of cannabis products from the retailer to the consumer point of collection options the legislature may wish to consider assigning tax remittance responsibilities to the cultivator the first distributor the last distributor or the retailer criteria to consider when choosing taxed event and point of collection below we identify some key criteria to consider when choosing the taxed event and the point of collection roughly in descending order of importance these criteria reflect conditions conducive to effective tax administration and compliance nexus between taxed event and point of collection for most taxes a single entity a taxpayer participates in the taxed event collects the original tax payment and remits the tax to the state in other words there is a very close nexus between the taxed event and the point of collection in contrast california s cannabis taxes split these responsibilities between multiple businesses this separation of taxpaying responsibilities weakens each business s incentive to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid an additional concern arises because many cannabis businesses have limited access to financial services due to federal criminalization the current split of taxpaying responsibilities often involves cash changing hands multiple times leading to problems with security compliance and enforcement furthermore distributor remittance of the retail excise tax requires a markup calculation that makes the tax more difficult to administer for most taxes a single entity a taxpayer participates in the taxed event collects the original tax

to administer taxpayer characteristics an ideal taxpayer plays a consistent role in the supply chain is readily identifiable and visible to tax administrators and the public has an established relationship with tax administrators and is familiar with the record keeping practices needed to pay taxes accurately and comply with audits an ideal taxpayer plays a consistent role in the supply chain is readily identifiable and visible to tax administrators and the public has an established relationship with tax administrators and is familiar with the record keeping practices needed to pay

taxpayers to the estimated number of taxpayers under two alternative points of collection as shown in the figure we estimate that collecting taxes from retailers would result in a significantly smaller taxpayer population than collecting from cultivators or last distributors the current point of collection all else equal tax administration is more cost effective when there are fewer

cannabis businesses have limited access to financial services including credit as a result it could be difficult for some of these businesses to set aside money for tax payments before consumers purchase their products to address this concern the legislature could levy cannabis taxes as late in the supply chain as possible for each type of tax there are trade offs among different taxed events and points of collection below we summarize the main trade offs and assess the best taxed event and point of collection for each type of tax ad valorem basic and tiered tax retail sales and collect tax from retailers compared to distributors retailers play a more consistent and public facing role in the supply chain and they already interact with cdtfa through the sales tax additionally moving tax payments to the retail level could address concerns related to credit constraints accordingly we view retail sales and retailers as the best taxed event and point of collection respectively for both types of ad valorem cannabis taxes as discussed in our related online post a key interaction between sales taxes and other taxes on cannabis retailers moving the point of collection to the retail level could give the state an opportunity to create a uniform tax base across multiple retail taxes potency based tax two reasonable options many of the reasons for levying ad valorem taxes at the retail level also apply to potency based taxes as shown in figures 2 and 4 however lab testing of cannabis products occurs shortly before distribution from the last distributor to the retailer accordingly there is a close nexus between the last distributor and the initial measurement of the tax base for a potency based tax overall a reasonable case could be made to 1 levy a potency based tax on the retail sale and collect it from the retailer or to 2 levy a potency based tax on the last distribution and collect it from the distributor weight based tax sale or transfer to first distributor and collect tax from first distributor the only practical opportunities to weigh cannabis plants occur early in the supply chain around the time of sale or transfer from the cultivator to the first distributor accordingly this sale or transfer is the best taxed event for a weight based tax and the point of collection should be one of the two businesses involved in the transaction the cultivator or the first distributor historically the legislature has adjusted excise tax rates very infrequently if this experience is a guide the legislature might want to think carefully about the timing of any changes to the state s cannabis tax structure and rates on one hand the sooner the legislature changes the state s cannabis taxes the sooner the state will realize any benefits associated with those changes on the other hand as discussed below there are advantages to waiting until more information is available and the market is more stable full implementation of track and trace could provide valuable data information that licensees enter into the track and trace system could be very helpful for estimating the effects of potential changes to the state s cannabis taxes we anticipate that track and trace system data collection will ramp up considerably in the coming months since all licensees are now required to participate additionally we expect that the data in the system will improve over time as licensees become accustomed to using it and administering agencies have time to validate the data information that licensees enter into the track and trace system

agencies have time to validate the data current law limits researchers access to track and trace chapter 27 o f 2017 i mposes strict limits on access to track and trace data specifically the statute allows access only for authorized state and local government employees pursuant to certain laws while there are legitimate reasons such as privacy concerns for restricting access to track and trace data these restrictions makes it difficult for our office or other researchers to use the data to help inform the legislature s policymaking chapter f mposes strict limits on access to track and trace data specifically the statute allows access only for authorized state and local government employees pursuant to certain laws while there are legitimate reasons such as privacy concerns for restricting access to track and trace data these restrictions makes it difficult for our office or other researchers to use the data to help inform the legislature s policymaking scientific understanding of cannabis effects will improve although there is some useful research on the effects of cannabis federal criminalization of cannabis has impeded research progress for example researchers have had to purchase cannabis from one supplier and have not had access to the full range of cannabis strains and products that are available in the marketplace accordingly there are still significant gaps in scientific understanding of the health effects of various cannabis products over time we anticipate that research will fill some of these gaps and scientific understanding of the effects of cannabis will improve particularly if the federal government loosens its restrictions this improved understanding could help the legislature create a tax structure that more effectively addresses the harmful aspects of the plant or more effectively differentiates between medical and adult use for tax purposes although there is some useful research on the effects of cannabis federal criminalization of cannabis has impeded research progress for example researchers have had to purchase cannabis from one supplier and have not had access to the full range of cannabis strains and

could help the legislature create a tax structure that more effectively addresses the harmful aspects of the plant or more effectively differentiates between medical and adult use for tax purposes regulatory environment and industry are still in flux california s legal cannabis industry is still in the early stages of its development making it difficult to predict what the industry will look like in the future the long term effects of tax policy changes would depend on industry growth licensing requirements market structure prices potency product mix and many other factors that could change considerably in the coming years as described further below and summarized in figure 13 we recommend that the legislature make various changes to cannabis taxes these changes which could be complemented by changes to nontax policies include 1 replacing the state s existing cannabis taxes with a potency based or tiered ad valorem tax 2 choosing the taxed event and point of collection to match the type of tax chosen 3 setting the tax rate to match the legislature s policy goals and 4 taking some related actions such as clarifying access to track and trace data and crafting the definition of gross receipts carefully we recommend that the legislature enact these changes soon given the benefits they could yield additionally we recommend that the legislature revisit cannabis taxes periodically to see if further changes are warranted in light of new information from track and trace and from scientific research on the effects of cannabis figure 13 summary of recommendations replace the existing cannabis taxes with potency based or tiered ad valorem tax these taxes could reduce harmful use more effectively than other types of taxes could consider keeping basic ad valorem instead but recommend against weight based specify taxed event and point of collection to match type of tax potency based tax tax retail sale and collect from retailer or tax wholesale sale and collect from last distributor ad valorem tax tiered or basic tax retail sale and collect from retailer weight based tax tax sale or transfer from cultivator to first distributor and collect from either of those businesses set specific tax rate for potency based or tiered ad valorem tax set specific structure in consultation with scientific experts potency based rate between 0 006 and 0 009 per milligram of thc could be appropriate specific rate depends on policy priorities for basic ad valorem retail tax set rate between 15 percent and 20 percent choose specific rate based on policy priorities consider ongoing rate adjustments take related actions clarify statutory authority to access track and trace data craft definition of gross receipts carefully as discussed in our 2018 report taxation of sugary drinks we view reducing harmful use as the most compelling reason to levy an excise tax a potency based or tiered ad valorem tax could reduce harmful use more effectively than a basic ad valorem tax or a weight based tax for this reason we view these types of taxes as worthwhile even though they would be harder to administer than a basic ad valorem tax accordingly we recommend that the legislature replace the state s existing cannabis taxes with a potency based or tiered ad valorem tax however if policymakers place different weights on the criteria we identified they could select a different type of tax in particular if they value ease of administration and compliance more highly than reducing harmful use they may prefer to keep the existing retail excise tax which is a basic ad valorem tax we do not recommend keeping the weight based cultivation tax since it is generally the weakest type we recommend that the legislature choose the taxed event and point of collection to match the type of tax it has selected as described in our assessment these changes could improve tax administration and compliance choosing taxed event and point of collection for recommended tax types if the legislature adopts a tiered ad valorem tax we recommend it levy the tax on the retail sale and collect the tax directly from retailers if the legislature adopts a potency based tax we recommend that it either 1 levy it on the retail sale and collect it from the retailer or 2 levy it on the last distribution and collect it from the last distributor choosing taxed event and point of collection for other types of taxes as noted above we do not recommend retaining the weight based cultivation tax or the ad valorem retail excise tax if the legislature nevertheless chooses to retain the cultivation tax we recommend that it move the point of collection to the cultivator or the first distributor if it chooses to retain the ad valorem retail excise tax we recommend it levy the tax on the retail sale and collect the tax directly from the retailer we recommend that the legislature set the tax rate to match its policy goals below we provide specific recommendations for each type of tax setting tax rates for recommended tax types if the legislature adopts a potency based or tiered ad valorem tax as we recommend above we recommend that the legislature specify the details of these tax structures in close consultation with scientific experts such expertise is crucial for determining key details such as setting the cutoffs between tiers for a tiered ad valorem tax as the legislature sets specific tax rates we recommend that it consider the goals identified in the measure competition with the illicit market revenue sufficiency and youth use as well as other policy considerations such as other harmful use and medical use notably as the legislature considers the effects of such changes it will be important to have reliable data on the types of cannabis products sold in california and their potencies we expect that data from the track and trace system could be used for this purpose in the near future perhaps sometime in 2020 currently available information suggests that a potency based tax in the range of 0 006 to 0 009 per milligram of thc could be appropriate depending on how policymakers weigh the importance of reducing the illicit market versus raising revenues for a tiered ad valorem tax the average rate across tiers should reflect the legislature s policy priorities in line with our discussion of the basic ad valorem tax below adjusting tax rates for other types of taxes if the legislature decides not to adopt a potency based or tiered ad valorem cannabis tax we nevertheless recommend that the legislature eliminate the cultivation tax in this case we recommend that the legislature set the retail excise tax rate somewhere in the range of 15 to 20 percent this is because a 15 percent rate would result in a very substantial risk of falling below the 350 million threshold while a rate of 20 percent would result in a low risk of falling below the threshold the legislature s specific choice within this range would depend in large part on how it weighs the revenue sufficiency goal against other goals such as competing with the illicit market and discouraging youth use this choice additionally would depend on the legislature s own assessment of the sufficient level of revenues and its tolerance for risking falling short of that level consider implementing ongoing rate adjustments if the legislature selects a basic or tiered ad valorem tax and is concerned about declines in the tax s effectiveness due to potential price declines we recommend that it consider implementing ongoing rate adjustments for example the legislature could consider directing the administration to adjust the rate periodically based on a predetermined formula that takes into account changes in average prices alternatively the legislature could respond to price changes or market conditions more broadly by changing the rate in statute while the statutory approach would help the legislature maintain a more active role in setting the tax rate the legislature s longstanding practice of infrequent excise tax rate adjustment suggests that it might prefer the administrative approach clarify statutory authority to access track and trace data since current statutes provide very limited access to track and trace data that could be valuable for setting tax rates or making other policy decisions regarding cannabis we recommend that the legislature broaden the explicit statutory authorization to access track and trace data to allow our office academic researchers and state agencies to conduct this type of research such access could be structured to address confidentiality concerns craft definition of gross receipts carefully as discussed in our related online post a key interaction between cannabis taxes and sales taxes there is an opaque counterintuitive interaction between sales taxes and other taxes on retail gross receipts such as local cannabis taxes due to this interaction the overall tax rate on cannabis is slightly higher than it appears to be as discussed in the post we recommend that the legislature craft the definition of retail gross receipts carefully to minimize such interactions in this report we analyze several decisions regarding potential changes to california s cannabis taxes the first and most basic decision is what type of tax to levy we recommend that the legislature replace the state s existing cannabis taxes with a tax designed to reduce harmful cannabis use more effectively namely a potency based tax or tiered ad valorem tax that said if the legislature prioritizes administration and compliance more highly a basic ad valorem tax is worth considering we further recommend changes to the way the state collects cannabis taxes the taxed event and point of collection and to the tax rate itself our recommended range of tax rates reflects the three goals outlined in statute undercutting illicit market prices generating sufficient revenues and discouraging youth use in pursuit of these goals we also encourage the legislature to consider complementing tax changes with nontax policies in this appendix we describe our methodological approach to estimating the effects of cannabis tax rate changes on legal consumption and tax revenues additionally we use an example to illustrate some problems with using simple metrics such as before and after comparisons to estimate the effects of rate changes retrospectively reviewed research and data we reviewed economic research on legal cannabis markets in california and other states and examined data on market conditions in those markets to assess the usefulness of each study as it might apply to california we considered the quality of its methods and data the degree of similarity between the study s setting and present day california and the applicability of the study to changes in california s cannabis tax rates to the extent that there were key differences between the study s setting and present day california such as price differences we tried to adjust the study s estimates to account for those differences we determined that this body of evidence could support estimates of the short term effects of tax rate changes on legal consumption and tax revenues but not estimates of longer term effects or effects on other outcomes we list some key studies in the selected references section set up structure of model we created a simple model connecting changes in tax rates to changes in key market outcomes ultimately resulting in changes in tax revenue in particular our model considers the following sequence of events first we adjust for various changes such as price declines that could occur in the legal cannabis market between the most recent data available and the time when tax rate changes could go into effect next we assume a change in tax rates figure 9 i n this report displays our estimates for four examples of such rate changes but we also examined a variety of other possible changes n this report displays our estimates for four examples of such rate changes but we also examined a variety of other possible changes consumers and the cannabis industry respond to the change in the tax rate the model uses two numbers to characterize these responses 1 t he extent to which changes in tax rates would result in changes in retail prices and 2 h ow strongly consumers respond to changes in retail prices for example consumers price sensitivity could depend on their willingness to substitute between legal and illegal cannabis these two numbers determine the changes in prices and quant
as the progressive wing of the democratic party pushes an agenda that asks millionaires and billionaires to pay higher taxes to fund ambitious social programs 2020 hopeful elizabeth warren has made an unprecedented tax proposal on accumulated wealth a centerpiece of her campaign and nearly a year into her presidential bid that wealth tax has become a central funding mechanism for a host of major policy proposals despite lingering doubts about its constitutionality and whether it can generate the cash flow she promises warren has connected the wealth tax to no fewer than eight separate initiatives student debt cancellation universal childcare universal pre k 800 billion in new federal funding for public schools tuition free college 50 billion for historically black colleges and universities 1 trillion for medicare for all tackling the opioid crisis warren told pro school choice activist she sent her kids to public school campaign says otherwise we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in america we can put 800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools we can make college tuition free for every kid we can put 50 billion into historically black colleges and universities warren said of what she would do with the revenue from a wealth tax during the democratic primary debate in november we can invest in an entire generation warren s current iteration of a wealth tax which she terms an ultra millionaire tax would require families to pay a 2 percent levy for every dollar of their net worth over 50 million and force billionaires to cough up 6 percent of their net worth over 1 billion her original plan would ve taxed 3 percent of families wealth over 1 billion but after being pressed on how she would fund medicare for all warren announced that billionaires would be required to pay a 6 percent wealth tax to help fund the program warren s policy is slightly less ambitious than a similar plan introduced by sen bernie sanders i vt her main adversary as she courts the progressive wing of the party both argue a wealth tax would make the u s tax system more fair than the current one which taxes income but does not go after money people already have our tax code focuses on taxing income but a family s wealth is also an important measure of how much it has benefitted from the economy and its ability to pay taxes warren s campaign website reads and judged against wealth our tax system asks the rich to pay a lot less than everyone else he families in the top 0 1 are projected to owe 3 2 of their wealth in federal state and local taxes this year while the bottom 99 are projected to owe 7 2 bureaucracy bonanza warren s plans would create plethora of new federal offices warren sees this untaxed accumulated wealth as a source of funding for a wide variety of programs but those on the right and even some on the left are skeptical about how effective a wealth tax would be or even if it s legal writing for fox news earlier this year heritage foundation research associate joel griffith argued that while the constitution permits direct taxes on individuals if they are equally apportioned along with excise taxes and duties it is doubtful that a wealth tax would survive constitutional scrutiny the constitution does not specifically empower congress to adopt a wealth or asset tax as with the sixteenth amendment an asset tax cannot be equally apportioned by definition it takes only from the better off and possessing wealth or assets is not by definition a transaction any more than owning a home is griffith wrote in fact seizing this private property without just compensation would clearly violate the fifth amendment takings clause key dem indicates warren s wealth tax has little chance of passing house warren s campaign website touts the endorsement of multiple constitutional scholars saying the tax would pass constitutional muster griffith also argued a wealth tax would create economically destructive distortions by artificially diverting capital from investment to consumption the result griffith says would cause wealthy people to consume their wealth rather than invest and grow it griffith says that those investments by entrepreneurs are what truly fuels the american economy not just consumption he also wrote that 10 of the 14 organisation for economic co operation and development countries to try wealth taxes in the past 23 years subsequently got rid of them fellow 2020 hopeful sen cory booker d n j echoed that point during the democratic presidential debate in november deval patrick in 2020 stop warns fellow dems hating republicans is not good politics the tax the way we re putting it forward right now the wealth tax i m sorry it s cumbersome its been tried by other nations it s hard to evaluate we can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation booker said in a heated exchange with warren but again we as democrats have got to start talking not just about how you tax from a stage but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it according to warren s own analysis a wealth tax would generate 3 75 trillion in 10 years for the u s government those numbers however have been disputed marc goldwein the senior vice president and senior policy director for the non partisan committee for a responsible federal budget said there are several factors that could result in the wealth tax bringing in significantly less than warren s projected 3 75 trillion if we think we re going to get 100 percent of our expected tax base that s a little bit of a fantasy because people will take measures to avoid the tax including some that aren t even what you d think of as tax avoidance marc goldwein committee for a responsible federal budget if we think we re going to get 100 percent of our expected tax base that s a little bit of a fantasy because people will take measures to avoid the tax including some that aren t even what you d think of as tax avoidance just like spending the money or giving it to charity he told fox news this could frustrate warren s anti evasion measures she says would keep money in the u s and prevent those subject to the wealth tax from dodging it goldwein said the 15 percent avoidance rate baked into warren s numbers is likely low he also mentioned that warren s wealth taxes could see diminishing returns over time click here to get the fox news app when you have a very high tax you re actually eating at your own base he said specifically regarding the 6 percent levy on billionaires and so it s shrinking in real dollars the bigger your rate is the more likely you re actually eating into your own base and so you have less money in year two and year three and year four goldwein also noted that warren seems to view a wealth tax as something to add to other ways of taxing capital income like her proposed mark to market tax a tax on investments that increase in value rather than a replacement to such levies as other countries have done this he said could cause interactions between the policies that reduce the returns for both a recent analysis from the university of pennsylvania s penn wharton budget model also found the warren wealth tax would bring in at least 1 trillion less than projected over 10 years or somewhere between 2 3 trillion and 2 7 trillion meanwhile the study said the tax would cause the economy to shrink over the next 30 years but whether a wealth tax would be an effective source of funding or a drag on the economy the concept fits neatly into the current narrative of the progressive wing of the democratic party and follows with the voting public s general desire to soak the rich i m tired of free loading billionaires warren tweeted last month my wealthtax asks them to pitch in a little more so that every family can have a shot at the american dream
it was a remarkable across the board rally of a scale not seen in nearly a decade the cause mostly a head spinning reversal by the federal reserve which went from planning to raise interest rates to cutting them and pumping fresh money into the financial markets rarely in my career has everything worked simultaneously said mark vaselkiv chief investment officer for fixed income at the asset management firm t rowe price analysts at ned davis research tracked eight types of investments large and small domestic stocks developed and emerging market stocks treasuries corporate bonds commodities and real estate going back to 1972 in 2019 all eight generated profits and for the first time since 2010 each rose 5 per cent or more in fact the gains were much better than that with a median gain of 21 per cent for the eight asset classes the nasdaq composite index is up more than 30 per cent its best showing since 2013 small cap stocks are up nearly 24 per cent their best gains since 2013 the more than 14 gain for high quality us corporate bonds is the best showing since 2009 european shares up 23 per cent are likewise having their best year in a decade advertisement those gains can have a knock on effect on the economy outside wall street creating a feedback loop that helps encourage more buying the rally in bond prices which move in the opposite direction from yields has helped keep borrowing costs low for companies municipalities and the federal government and the stock market s surge is supporting spending by consumers who are the main driver of growth in the us economy not everyone benefits when markets rise like this some investors bet on certain markets to fall either because they think they re due for a drop or because they expect that the traditional relationships among different assets where some go up so others go down will help them hedge their portfolios and we should note that not absolutely everything rose in 2019 natural gas was a losing bet so was cobalt and even a rising stock market contains more than a few sinking ships macy s for instance dropped more than 40 per cent in 2019 there s little reason to assume that these kinds of uniform gains will continue usually different investments are driven by different kinds of dynamics stock prices for example have climbed at a faster clip than expectations for profit growth that means the market is looking more and more overvalued if corporate profits don t catch up stocks could stumble and while bond markets have soared increasing loads of corporate debt could prompt investors to sell if they think these companies are taking on too much risk advertisement one factor behind the rise in bond prices in 2019 was a growing worry about the impact of the trade war even though the trade war isn t over washington and beijing have reduced the tension between them and the economy isn t faring as poorly as people had feared good for stocks but bad for bonds but for now concerns about such market fundamentals seem set squarely on the back burner after the fed re invigorated risk taking in the markets by cutting interest rates three times out of concern that the trade war and a global growth slowdown would drag the us economy lower the cuts were an about face for the fed which in 2018 raised interest rates four times and unnerved financial markets along the way in fact instead of the rise in asset prices that investors enjoyed in 2019 the previous year was marked by a uniform decline reflecting worries that higher interest rates and the trade war would tip the economy into a recession the central bank also started to buy securities again in 2019 pumping about us60 billion into the financial markets every month while the most recent round of purchases has been billed as a technical fix instead of one meant to bolster the economy bond buying programs put in place after the financial crisis were widely credited for driving markets up sharply for much of the past decade similar moves by the fed aimed at shoring up economic growth helped supercharge returns in financial markets most close observers think this is precisely what happened in 2019 when people look back on this year they ll say the fed did this said evan brown head of multi asset strategy at ubs asset management the new york times

2017 the overhaul of the federal tax law in 2017 hailed by corporate executives major investors and the wealthiest americans was the signature legislative achievement of donald trump s presidencyimage eric thayer the new york times the overhaul of the federal tax law in 2017 was the signature legislative achievement of donald trump s presidency the biggest change to the tax code in three decades the law slashed taxes for big companies part of an effort to coax them to invest more in the united states and to discourage them from stashing profits in overseas tax havens corporate executives major investors and the wealthiest americans hailed the tax cuts as a once in a generation boon not only to their own fortunes but also to the u s economy but big companies wanted more and not long after the bill became law in december 2017 the trump administration began transforming the tax package into a greater windfall for the world s largest corporations and their shareholders the tax bills of many big companies have ended up even smaller than what was anticipated when the president signed the bill one consequence is that the federal government may collect hundreds of billions of dollars less over the coming decade than previously projected the budget deficit has jumped more than 50 since trump took office and is expected to top 1 trillion in 2020 partly as a result of the tax law laws like the 2017 tax cuts are carried out by federal agencies that first must formalize them via rules and regulations the process of writing the rules conducted largely out of public view can determine who wins and who loses starting in early 2018 senior officials in trump s treasury department were swarmed by lobbyists seeking to insulate companies from the few parts of the tax law that would have required them to pay more the crush of meetings was so intense that some top treasury officials had little time to do their jobs according to two people familiar with the process the lobbyists targeted a pair of major new taxes that were supposed to raise hundreds of billions of dollars from companies that had been avoiding taxes in part by claiming their profits were earned outside the united states the blitz was led by a cross section of the world s largest companies including anheuser busch credit suisse general electric united technologies barclays coca cola bank of america ubs ibm kraft heinz kimberly clark news corporation chubb conocophillips hsbc and the american international group thanks in part to the chaotic manner in which the bill was rushed through congress a situation that gave the treasury department extra latitude to interpret a law that was by all accounts sloppily written the corporate lobbying campaign was a resounding success through a series of obscure regulations the treasury carved out exceptions to the law that mean many leading american and foreign companies will owe little or nothing in new taxes on offshore profits according to a review of the treasury s rules government lobbying records and interviews with federal policymakers and tax experts companies were effectively let off the hook for tens if not hundreds of billions of taxes that they would have been required to pay treasury is gutting the new law said bret wells a tax law professor at the university of houston it is largely the top 1 that will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest people in the world it is the latest example of the benefits of the republican tax package flowing disproportionately to the richest of the rich even a tax break that was supposed to aid poor communities an initiative called opportunity zones is being used in part to finance high end developments in affluent neighborhoods at times benefiting those with ties to the trump administration of course companies didn t get everything they wanted and brian morgenstern a treasury spokesman defended the department s handling of the tax rules no particular taxpayer or group had any undue influence at any time in the process he said racing for a win ever since the birth of the modern federal income tax in 1913 companies have been concocting ways to avoid it in the late 1990s american companies accelerated their efforts to claim that trillions of dollars of profits they earned in high tax places like the united states japan or germany were actually earned in low or no tax places like luxembourg bermuda or ireland google apple cisco pfizer merck coca cola facebook and many others have deployed elaborate techniques that let the companies pay taxes at far less than the 35 corporate tax rate in the united states that existed before the 2017 changes their playful nicknames like double irish and dutch sandwich made them sound benign the obama administration and lawmakers from both parties have tried to combat this profit shifting but their efforts mostly stalled when trump and congressional republicans assembled an enormous tax cut package in 2017 they pitched it in part as a grand bargain companies would get the deep tax cuts that they had spent years clamoring for but the law would also represent a long overdue effort to fight corporate tax avoidance and the shipment of jobs overseas the situation where companies are actually encouraged to move overseas and keep their profits overseas makes no sense sen rob portman r ohio said on the senate floor in november 2017 republicans were racing to secure a legislative victory during trump s first year in office a period marked by the administration s failure to repeal obamacare and an embarrassing procession of political blunders sweeping tax cuts could give republicans a jolt of much needed momentum heading into the 2018 midterm elections to speed things along republicans used a congressional process known as budget reconciliation which blocked democrats from filibustering and allowed republicans to pass the bill with a simple majority but to qualify for that parliamentary green light the net cost of the bill after accounting for different tax cuts and tax increases had to be less than 1 5 trillion over 10 years the bill s cuts totaled 5 5 trillion the corporate income tax rate shrank to 21 from 35 and companies also won a tax break on the trillions in profits brought home from offshore to close the gap between the 5 5 trillion in cuts and the maximum price tag of 1 5 trillion the package sought to raise new revenue by eliminating deductions and introducing new taxes shifting money two of the biggest new taxes were supposed to apply to multinational corporations and lawmakers bestowed them with easy to pronounce acronyms beat and gilti that belie their complexity beat stands for the base erosion and anti abuse tax it was aimed largely at foreign companies with major operations in the united states some of which had for years minimized their u s tax bills by shifting money between american subsidiaries and their foreign parent companies instead of paying taxes in the united states companies send the profits to countries with lower tax rates the beat aimed to make that less lucrative some payments that companies sent to their foreign affiliates would face a new 10 tax the other big measure was called gilti global intangible low taxed income to reduce the benefit companies reaped by claiming that their profits were earned in tax havens the law imposed an additional tax of up to 10 5 on some offshore earnings the joint committee on taxation the congressional panel that estimates the impacts of tax changes predicted that the beat and gilti would bring in 262 billion over a decade roughly enough to fund the treasury department the environmental protection agency and the national cancer institute for 10 years sitting in the oval office on dec 22 2017 trump signed the tax cuts into law it was and remains the president s most significant legislative achievement built in loopholes from the start the new taxes were pocked with loopholes in the beat for example senate republicans hoped to avoid a revolt by large companies they wrote the law so that any payments an american company made to a foreign affiliate for something that went into a product as opposed to say interest payments on loans were excluded from the tax let s say an american pharmaceutical company sells pills in the united states the pills are manufactured by a subsidiary in ireland and the american parent pays the irish unit for the pills before they are sold to the public those payments mean that the company s profits in the united states where taxes are relatively high go down profits in tax friendly ireland go up because such payments to ireland wouldn t be taxed some companies that had been the most aggressive at shifting profits into offshore havens were spared the full brunt of the beat other companies like general electric were surprised to be hit by the new tax thinking it applied only to foreign multinationals according to pat brown who had been ge s top tax expert brown now the head of international tax policy at the accounting and consulting firm pwc said on a podcast this year that the trump administration should bridge the gap between expectations about the tax law and how it was playing out in reality he lobbied the treasury on behalf of ge the question he said is how creative and how expansive is treasury and the irs able to be an exhaustive lobbying campaign almost immediately after trump signed the bill companies and their lobbyists including ge s brown began a full court pressure campaign to try to shield themselves from the beat and gilti the treasury department had to figure out how to carry out the hastily written law which lacked crucial details chip harter was the treasury official in charge of writing the rules for the beat and gilti he had spent decades at pwc and the law firm baker mckenzie counseling companies on the same sorts of tax avoidance arrangements that the new law was supposed to discourage starting in january 2018 he and his colleagues found themselves in nonstop meetings roughly 10 a week at times with lobbyists for companies and industry groups the organization for international investment a powerful trade group for foreign multinationals like swiss food company nestlé and dutch chemical maker lyondellbasell objected to a treasury proposal that would have prevented companies from using a complex currency accounting maneuver to avoid the beat the group s lobbyists were from pwc and baker mckenzie harter s former firms according to public lobbying disclosures one of them pam olson was the top treasury tax official in the george w bush administration morgenstern the treasury spokesman said harter didn t meet with pwc while the rules were being written this month the treasury issued the final version of some of the beat regulations the organization for international investment got what it wanted helping foreign banks one of the most effective campaigns with the greatest financial consequence was led by a small group of large foreign banks including credit suisse and barclays u s regulators require international banks to ensure that their united states divisions are financially equipped to absorb big losses in a crisis to meet those requirements foreign banks lend the money to their american outposts those loans accrue interest under the beat the interest that the american units paid to their european parents would often be taxed foreign banks should not be penalized by the u s tax laws for complying with regulations said briget polichene chief executive of the institute of international bankers whose members include many of the world s largest banks banks flooded the treasury department with lobbyists and letters late last year harter went to treasury secretary steven mnuchin and told him about the plan to give the banks a break mnuchin a longtime banking executive before joining the trump administration signed off on the new exemptions according to a person familiar with the matter a few months later the tax policy office handed another victory to the foreign banks ruling that an even wider range of bank payments would be exempted among the lobbyists who successfully pushed the banks case in private meetings with senior treasury officials was erika nijenhuis of the law firm cleary gottlieb her client was the institute of international bankers in september 2019 nijenhuis took off her lobbying hat and joined the treasury s office of tax policy which was still writing the rules governing the tax law some tax experts said that the treasury had no legal authority to exempt the bank payments from the beat only congress had that power the trump administration created the exception out of whole cloth said wells the university of houston professor even inside the treasury the ruling was controversial some officials told harter the senior official in charge of the international rules that the department lacked the power according to people familiar with the discussions harter dismissed the objections officials at the joint committee on taxation have calculated that the exemptions for international banks could reduce by up to 50 billion the revenue raised by the beat overall the beat is likely to collect a small fraction of the 150 billion of new tax revenue that was originally projected by congress said thomas horst who advises companies on their overseas tax arrangements he came to that conclusion after reviewing the tax disclosures in more than 140 annual reports filed by multinationals morgenstern the treasury spokesman said we thoroughly reviewed these issues internally and are fully comfortable that we have the legal authority for the conclusions reached in these regulations he said nijenhuis was not involved in crafting the beat rules he also said the treasury decided that changing the rules for foreign banks was appropriate we were responsive to job creators he said heading to the hill the lobbying surrounding the gilti was equally intense and once again large companies won valuable concessions back in 2017 republicans said the gilti was meant to prevent companies from avoiding american taxes by moving their intellectual property overseas in the pharmaceutical and tech industries in particular profits are often tied to patents companies had sold the rights to their patents to subsidiaries in offshore tax havens the companies then imposed steep licensing fees on their american units the sleight of hand transactions reduced profits in the united states and left them in places like bermuda and the british virgin islands but after the law was enacted large multinationals in industries like consumer products discovered that the gilti tax applied to them too that threatened to cut into their windfalls from the corporate tax rate s falling to 21 from 35 lobbyists for procter gamble and other companies turned to lawmakers for help they asked members of the senate finance committee to tell treasury officials that they hadn t intended the gilti to affect their industries it was a simple but powerful strategy because the treasury was required to consider congressional intent when writing the tax rules such explanations could sway the outcome several senators then met with mnuchin to discuss the rules one lobbyist michael caballero had been a senior treasury official in the obama administration his clients included credit suisse and industrial conglomerate united technologies he met repeatedly with treasury and white house officials and pushed them to modify the rules so that big companies hit by the gilti wouldn t lose certain tax deductions in essence the high tax exception that caballero was proposing would allow companies to deduct expenses that they incurred in their overseas operations from their american profits lowering their u s tax bills other companies jumped on the bandwagon news corp liberty mutual anheuser busch comcast and p g wrote letters or dispatched lobbyists to argue for the high tax exception after months of meetings with lobbyists the treasury announced in june 2019 that it was creating a version of the exception that the companies had sought an implied threat two years after the tax cuts became law their impact is becoming clear companies continue to shift hundreds of billions of dollars to overseas tax havens ensuring that huge sums of corporate profits remain out of reach of the u s government the internal revenue service is collecting tens of billions of dollars less in corporate taxes than congress projected inflating the tax law s 13 figure price tag this month the organization for economic cooperation and development calculated that the united states in 2018 experienced the largest drop in tax revenue of any of the group s 36 member countries the united states also had by far the largest budget deficit of any of those countries in the coming days the treasury is likely to complete its last round of rules carrying out the tax cuts big companies have spent this fall trying to win more in september chris d trunck the vice president for tax at owens corning the maker of insulation and roofing materials wrote to the irs he pushed the treasury to tinker with the gilti rules in a way that would preserve hundreds of millions of dollars of tax benefits that owens corning had accumulated from settling claims that it poisoned employees and others with asbestos the same month underwear manufacturer hanes sent its own letter to mnuchin the letter from bryant purvis hanes vice president of global tax urged mnuchin to broaden the high tax exception so that more companies could take advantage of it otherwise purvis warned the gilti regime will become an impediment to u s companies and their ability to not only compete globally as a general matter but also their ability to remain u s headquartered if they are to maintain the overall fiscal health of their business the implied threat was clear if the treasury didn t further chip away at the new tax companies like hanes based in winston salem north carolina might have no choice but to move their headquarters overseas 2019 new york times news service

the one thing i ve learned from writing about small business owners is that it s never smart to generalize there are 30 million of us around the country you can t just make a blanket comment like things are good or things are not good for small businesses because all of that depends on what industry the business is in where they re located or what specific circumstances a business owner may be facing that s unique to what they do that said i ll predict that for the majority of small businesses 2020 will be a pretty easy year like always we ll have to work hard battle for customers and deal with problems but why so easy for starters do you ever hear much in the media about small businesses nowadays sure you ll get the odd tragic story of the business owner suffering under president trump s tariffs or the little girl who faced a regulatory firing squad because she tried to sell lemonade but where are all the stories about the failures the bankruptcies the decline of main street you don t hear these stories because there aren t so many of them for the most part small businesses are off the media radar that s only due to one reason the economy the u s economy is strong yes it could be stronger but demand for our products remains high interest rates are low so is inflation this past holiday season was the biggest ever small business saturday was a blowout e commerce is creating millionaires selling glassware and craft pillows from their living rooms banks and online lenders are anxious to do deals inexpensive cloud technology is enabling piddly little companies like mine to hire people anywhere around the world cut our rents and look and act professional with our clients and community the stock market may be overpriced but is it no one seems to really know that for sure of course deficits are terrifying but no one can really tell me what that means for my business all i know is that survey after survey shows higher than ever business confidence and that the most important factors driving the economy retail sales new home sales the best since 2007 unemployment personal income and spending and industrial production continue to trend up remember a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth no one not even the most pessimistic of economists is predicting that for the next two quarters small business owners know this and are comfortable taking risks in this environment next is that the current political temperament in washington is very very pro business president trump is not going to be impeached in the meantime regulations continue to be cut and tax rates are trending down not up it s a foregone conclusion that even the most economically debilitating legislation coming out of the house from a national 15 minimum wage to the green new deal will be dead on arrival in the republican held senate in short businesses aren t going to have to worry too much about what washington is doing this year if they do anything that requires bipartisan support like the secure act it ll likely be pro business finally our trade disputes are slowly but surely getting resolved we have nafta 2 0 we have deals coming with europe the united kingdom one of our largest trading partners will soon be untethered from the european union and ready to come into the fold and we re making progress with china say what you want about president trump but all of his posturing has created new and better deals than before many businesses have suffered during all of this and yet through it all small business confidence and economic growth have remained strong imagine what will happen for many of these companies in 2020 now that these trade deals will soon be in the rearview mirror of course we re still going to face challenges employment is tight immigration is a mess as the federal government stands still on workplace issues states and cities are passing laws requiring vacations sick pay and higher wages not to mention stepping up long needed rules concerning discrimination and harassment and then there s the coming election a new administration may mean much higher taxes significantly more regulations more expansive government oversight and a disruptive overhaul of our health care system such changes and many are good in theory would in reality cause an enormous amount of uncertainty capital flight and as a result a significant pull back in investment and hiring that could all lead to darker economic times for small business owners but that s not until 2021 if you re running a small business you should appreciate the easiness of 2020 just make sure to save your profits somewhere you might need those savings in the near future gene marks is founder of the marks group a small business consulting firm he frequently appears on cnbc fox business and msnbc
the euro the pound and some trade sensitive currencies rallied as the dollar slid to a six month low today investors are confident that global growth prospects are improving and that us china trade relations are getting significantly better after staying strong for much of 2019 thanks to the relative outperformance of the us economy and investors preference for a safe haven currency amid the trade dispute between washington and beijing the dollar s gains for the year have shrank in december the buoyant end of year sentiment enocouraged investors to buy up currencies linked to trade and global growth this sent currencies such as the australian dollar chinese yuan and scandinavian crowns to multi month or multi week highs against the greenback the dollar index was last down 0 3 at 96 435 its weakest since july 1 in thin volumes on the last day of the decade currencies were also more volatile than many had expected analysts did not attribute the moves to any specific new developments i can t see much reason for the movement in the fx market except end year position squaring or just being careful and cutting positions ahead of the new year s holiday and the start of 2020 as a result i wouldn t draw any big conclusions from it said marshal gittler currency analyst at acls global chinese vice premier liu he will visit washington this week to sign a phase 1 trade deal with the us the south china morning post reported earlier this week white house trade adviser peter navarro said the trade deal would likely be signed in the next week but that confirmation would come from president donald trump or the us trade representative investors appetite for risk helped drive the euro up 0 3 to 1 1230 a new four and a half month high signs that the euro zone economy may be stabilising have lifted the common currency in recent weeks as investors unwound short positions though the currency has shed around 2 of its value against the dollar in 2019 meanwhile sterling hit new two week highs against the dollar however the possibility of a no deal brexit at the end of 2020 means the currency is still not close to where it was on december 12 the day prime minister boris johnson won the british election the pound galloped 0 8 to as high as at 1 3212 and was 0 5 stronger against the euro at 85 pence sterling has gained around 3 5 against the dollar in 2019 and 5 4 compared to the euro as fears of an imminent disorderly exit from the european union eased and then lifted with the passing of johnson s brexit withdrawal agreement in parliament the us dollar was weak across the board cutting 2019 gains for the index that tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies to 0 3 mufg analysts saw a bearish technical development for the us dollar that signals an increasing risk of further weakness ahead weakness in the us dollar towards the end of this year has coincided with the renewed expansion of the fed s balance and the paring back of pessimism over the outlook for global growth they said against the japanese yen the dollar fell to a near three week low of 108 50 yen and was last down 0 4
wall street is on the verge of completing a fabulous 2019 after a pathetic 2018 this year the u s economy and stock market touched several milestones in march wall street bull run completed 10 years historically this is the longest bull run of the u s stock markets in july the u s economy entered the historically longest 11th year of expansion all three major stock indexes reached several fresh highs however the question is will this dream run continue in 2020 though experts are divided on their opinion here we give three reasons as to why the wall street rally may continue next year stable economy and corporate profit to support higher stock valuation the three major stock indexes the dow the s p 500 and the nasdaq composite gained 22 28 5 and 34 8 respectively with just a day of trading left for this year many industry experts have said that it will be difficult to sustain this level of valuation in 2020 however a stable u s economy is likely to be a cushion for the country s stocks the u s gdp growth is over 2 despite being its in the 126th month of expansion and completing a calendar decade without recession for the first time in history strong consumer spending which constitutes 70 of the gdp a strong labor market historically low level of unemployment steady growth of wage rate will bolster investors sentiments the two major drawbacks were weak business spending and lower corporate profit however these were the fallout of a lingering trade conflict and tariff war with china a possible interim trade deal with china in early january is expected to boost business confidence and profits scrapping of proposed tariffs rollback of some tariffs imposed earlier and an agreement on intellectual property disputes along with strong enforcement provisions and a substantial hike in agricultural imports by china will pave the way for growth our current consensus estimate indicates an acceleration in earnings growth from 2020 and beyond fed to support u s economic expansion the federal reserve which was largely blamed for the stock market rout in december 2018 due to its ultra hawkish stance quickly corrected itself in 2019 after remaining quite in the first half of 2019 the central bank reduced the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in three equal trenches after the trade talk broke abruptly in may and government yield curve inverted in august fearing an impending recession fed s timey intervention not only boosted the economy and raised investors confidence it also helped the sagging u s housing market to recover with a low mortgage rate moreover the central bank has adopted quantitative easing program through accelerating the growth of its balance sheet the fed chair has reiterated his commitment to do whatever needed to support economic expansion and not raise interest rate until the inflation rate which is currently at just 1 6 crosses the fed s target level of 2 globally u s stock markets are the best the u s stock markets are the best destination for investors during the post recession era overall returns of u s stocks were nearly four times higher than the rest of the world after successfully recovering from the great recession wall street recovered overwhelmingly from the trade related assault of 2018 the gigantic size of the u s economy has given it a clear upper hand over emerging markets furthermore geopolitical conflicts are not going to harm united states as much as the rest of the world technological innovation and superiority has always been a strong pillar of u s economic strength wall street witnessed a broad based rally in 2019 in addition to the three major stock indexes which predominantly constituted of large cap stocks the s p 400 mid cap index soared 24 3 so far this year the russell 2000 index the benchmark index for small cap stocks jumped 22 7 and the s p 600 small cap index surged 20 the likely signing of phase one trade deal between the united states and china is expected to boost global economy which will bolster u s exports oil prices are likely to rise owing to higher demand and the united states will be the major beneficiary of higher oil prices the government yield curve is currently firmly northbound and bond market induced recessionary fear is overblown how to pick the right stocks at this stage several stocks are available which looks attractive for future growth however selecting three criteria will make the task easy first select large cap market cap more than 50 billion stocks which has stable business model and are regular

open this photo in gallery prime minister justin trudeau meets with us president donald trump in the oval office of the white house in washington dc on monday feb 13 2017 the norm shattering presidency of mr trump has transformed the idea of trade diversification from an objective to an imperative sean kilpatrick the canadian press eric miller is president of rideau potomac strategy group and a fellow at the canadian global affairs institute psychological research suggests that near death experiences often profoundly change one s life trajectory during the nafta renegotiation canada came as close to the edge of economic disaster as it had in decades while u s president donald trump did not make good on his threatened ruination of the canadian economy and his tearing up of the north american free trade agreement canada did for a time look into the abyss of economic chaos with its largest trading partner in response ottawa s policy makers began a renewed push for trade diversification the government s economic statement in the fall of 2018 announced canada s intention to increase its overseas or non u s exports by 50 per cent by 2025 meeting this goal will be challenging and requires a long term commitment to success today the united states takes more than 75 per cent of canada s exports given the scale and proximity of the u s and its largely business friendly climate the preference of canadian business for this market is understandable yet the norm shattering presidency of mr trump with its nafta renegotiation national security proclamations about canadian steel aluminum and uranium and repeated verbal broadsides has transformed the idea of trade diversification from an objective to an imperative sizing up the challenge the goal announced in the fall of 2018 was backed up with substantial new funding the leaders of the trade commissioner service and export development canada edc are significantly improving the effectiveness of canada s trade promotion infrastructure this work must continue but hitting the 2025 objective will require more than making the existing system better it will require policy innovation and different modes of collaboration canada can learn from the world s great trading countries including japan south korea and germany of course any successful diversification strategy must recognize the natural gravitational pull of the u s on canadian trade if firms can make the same return selling to indiana as to india they will typically opt to stay closer to home greater trade diversification does not necessarily mean less trade with the united states it just means more trade with everyone else de risking the core principle while their models differ in specifics japan south korea and germany have driven substantial trade growth over a long period of time including among smaller firms by de risking the exporting process canadian firms are regularly encouraged to go global while canada offers important support to its companies many canadian officials have privately lamented that canadian firms are frequently outgunned by competitors from these exporting countries which enjoy the comprehensive backing of their governments a central feature in japan s trade development system is the creation by its government of export opportunities through the financing of infrastructure and technology projects abroad how does this work first the japanese government approaches a partner country and offers to provide free infrastructure of interest to them in recent years this has ranged from installing most of the traffic lights in yangon myanmar to expanding subway networks in india some projects destined for international procurement such as the new ho chi minh city airport are never really bid out because non japanese firms cannot compete with japan s free upfront model next the government organizes financing for identified projects through the japanese international co operation agency tokyo s key development assistance mechanism as master project agreements are developed the japanese government and private sector organize consortiums of larger and smaller japanese companies to deliver them consortiums are often led by a large prime contractor with the capacity to manage a network of partners and suppliers because funding is provided by the japanese government companies are guaranteed to get paid a key consideration for work performed abroad the funds for the projects are substantially recycled into the japanese economy through purchases of japanese goods and services by working on these projects smaller japanese firms gain experience in markets they could never crack on their own importantly because the projects deploy japanese systems and technologies the receiving countries are virtually guaranteed to hire and pay japanese companies to do follow on and maintenance work indeed that s the model japan puts up the money to build the infrastructure and the countries pay through service contracts and upgrades japan sees development assistance as a conveyor belt for driving its own exports abroad yet recipient countries have a generally positive view of japan as a partner because it provides quality infrastructure that responds to their needs one can envision ways to canadianize this methodology the canadian commercial corp or edc could serve as the financing delivery vehicle the large prime contractors to lead consortiums could be identified at least initially through a partnership with an entity such as the business council of canada while canada does not have a plethora of large engineering firms an area such as cybersecurity where international demand is substantial and the ecosystem of canadian firms is broad may be a good place to start better use of trade agreements free trade agreements have been central to canada s export strategy in recent years unfortunately too few canadian firms seem to use them south korea suffered from the same challenge yet when its government signed agreements with the european union and the united states its leaders made a national priority of fully utilizing them south korea built world class information tools that are used for guiding importers managing trade processes and identifying opportunities they formed partnerships with customs brokers and other trade professionals to provide comprehensive education and troubleshooting around trade agreements and their opportunities the government also ramped up efforts to verify that its trading partners were respecting the rules of their agreements according to south korea s institute for international trade these efforts drove a 15 per cent jump in the number of exports using the european agreement over the first three years anecdotal evidence suggests that south korean officials informed by their information tools pro actively reach out to companies to discuss specific export prospects and opportunities to substitute foreign suppliers with domestic ones canada requires a similar national effort to take better advantage of existing trade agreements it needs information tools that can serve as the backbone of trade development efforts it would benefit from more effective partnerships with technical specialists such as the canadian society of customs brokers and the canadian association of importers and exporters the canadian government also needs to use its authorities more robustly to ensure that counterpart countries are complying with the rules of their trade agreements while also supporting a big export development push in these markets using other people s trade agreements canada seems unlikely to have trade agreements with china or india in the near future but some countries already do and can serve as connectors into these markets vietnam for example is a member with canada of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp and a member through the association of southeast asian nations asean of the bloc s agreements with china and india if intermediate inputs are sent from canada to vietnam under cptpp rules and are substantially transformed to meet the rules of origin and other technical requirements under say the asean china agreement the finished product can enter the chinese market duty free there is plenty of evidence that canadian companies are already engaging in this fully legal trade triangulation process better understanding these networks where technical overlaps exist in various trade agreements and how to support these indirect exports into key markets should be a priority for ottawa experiment in high growth large population countries as countries grow from lower income to middle income status they massively increase their consumption of products and services that canada can supply vietnam is precisely at this stage of economic development for instance success in such markets requires a long term commitment australia for example is investing heavily in brand building and creative marketing around food fashion and education why because when vietnamese consumers become middle class they may default to buying australian fast growing countries also have enormous technology needs given the networked nature of the tech economy the canadian technology accelerator program was launched in 2009 to help canadian firms in existing tech centres such as silicon valley activities range from providing mentorship and networking for senior executives to facilitating access to investors why not create a parallel mechanism for high growth developing countries such as vietnam while it would be perhaps more hands on than its silicon valley cousin including partnerships with national laboratories and emerging companies the goal is clear to give canada a privileged position as a partner in the commercialization of the many technologies that will emerge as vietnamese research grows more robust establish a commercial advocacy infrastructure germany knows that commercial diplomacy matters this is why its business associations with government support maintain offices in key locations globally under the common banner representative of german industry and trade rgit they advocate for german commercial interests support german companies in procurements and drive trade development while rgits are not housed within german embassies they work closely with embassy staff to foster a team germany model its management and funding structure which brings together industry groups that represent both large and smaller companies ensures that rgits are responsive to a variety of german firms not only the behemoths canada would benefit economically by having similar business representation in key markets a representative of canadian trade which could be jointly managed by the business council of canada canadian chamber of commerce canadian manufacturers exporters and canadian federation of independent business and co funded with the federal government is worth exploring next steps the path to trade diversification is not linear canada will continue to send a majority of its exports for the united states for the foreseeable future yet by learning and adapting the strategies of great trading nations canada can start moving the diversification needle there are three factors that will ultimately determine whether canada succeeds or fails first prime minister justin trudeau and mary ng minister of international trade need to remind canadians of the nafta abyss and make diversification a priority national project second trade officials provinces and the private sector must be encouraged to innovate with these great trading nation models and others success must be rewarded and good faith failure not punished third the trade minister must be held accountable against specific quantitative and qualitative metrics if we don t measure progress toward export diversification it will not be owned politically and will not succeed thomas edison famously said the value of an idea lies in the using of it while the concept of
