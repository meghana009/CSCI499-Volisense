discover the fundamental truth about the current silver price and what makes silver such an alluring investment opportunity that can sometimes exceed expectations silver is used in a variety of industries including electronics jewelry photography and medicine however the price of silver is volatile when compared to the u s dollar and can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time nevertheless silver has maintained its value for thousands of years and has demonstrated time and time again to be a good hedge against inflation diverse holdings are a key to financial success experienced investors recognize silver has value as both an investment and a monetary metal silver is often used as a form of investment as it is seen as a safe haven asset silver also has practical applications that help keep it in demand especially in the technology industry such as for solar panels and computer devices silver is a soft metal and is often mixed with other metals to create alloys which makes it useful for coinage as well as many other applications it is easy to understand the universal appeal of silver beginners and expert investors worldwide choose silver more than any other precious metal silver is a precious metal meaning it is rare and valuable precious metals are silver gold platinum palladium and rhodium the price of silver per ounce is lower than gold making it accessible for beginners and a viable option for those with a limited budget in the debate of gold versus silver the consensus often leans toward holding both precious metals owning a balanced combination of gold and silver provides investors with versatility in navigating different economic scenarios gold typically holds its value well during periods of deflation or credit crises while silver tends to perform favorably when inflationary pressures mount the relative pricing of gold and silver indicated by the gold to silver ratio can guide investors in determining which metal presents a more attractive investment opportunity ultimately the dual ownership of gold and silver offers a comprehensive approach to wealth preservation and diversification in an ever changing financial landscape silver s utility extends beyond being a mere investment it is a versatile industrial commodity with a wide range of applications this intrinsic value ensures that silver is unlikely to lose all its worth even in times of economic turbulence moreover silver coins with their historical significance and widespread recognition are likely to remain liquid and readily accepted in trade irrespective of fluctuations in their dollar value as such silver holds a prominent position in diversifying investment portfolios particularly in response to evolving economic conditions and various stages of the economic cycle amid a financial landscape characterized by central banks consistently injecting new money into the system physical silver stands as a tangible asset with a track record of maintaining and increasing its nominal dollar price unlike other investment options such as stocks or bonds silver carries no risk of bankruptcy or default rendering it a secure choice for wealth preservation silver much like gold has historically proven to be a reliable investment option particularly in the context of ongoing dollar devaluation the value of silver tends to rise as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties this relationship between silver prices and the dollar s purchasing power erosion makes silver an attractive choice for investors seeking a store of value collectible coins even cash range in value based on demand condition and rarity silver coins have been used as currency around the world throughout history silver bullion coins bars rounds silver paper silver etfs silver ira and silver futures are great investments regardless of inflation other countries throughout the world including europe china australia south africa and more have also had their own silver coins sometimes these silver coins were only for trade dollars such as times between the u s and chinese which were silver coins only intended for business and government purposes silver is one of the oldest known metals having been used for thousands of years in jewelry coins and other forms of currency it is estimated that silver coins could be the oldest mass produced form of coinage in history since the time of the greeks people have used silver coins as money instead of cash ancient persian silver coins date back to between 612 330 bc top selling silver bullion silver price and currency exchange rates as a matter of fact the value of money fluctuates based on each government and their interrelated exchanges silver is an international way to store value also known as a store of value regardless of surface level political events any investment conversation will usually focus on the range of unpredictability of currencies and stocks for this reason people continue to use and invest in precious metals such as silver and gold products as well as platinum and palladium theoretically if a person acquired ten ounces of silver in 2000 at 8 per ounce with a total of 80 spent today at a spot price of around 23 per ounce that ten ounces would be around 230 which is a 150 profit silver price and the stock market the stock market has seen a sustained upward trend largely driven by federal reserve policies however concerns are rising about the potential for a significant market pullback if the fed decides to tighten its monetary policies due to inflation and rising interest rates this has prompted investors to explore alternative assets like silver which tends to perform well during market turbulence and periods of inflation primarily due to negative real interest rates silver like gold is often considered a safe haven asset particularly during economic uncertainty and market volatility a key factor in the appeal of precious metals like silver is the presence of negative real interest rates where inflation exceeds nominal interest rates this condition currently exists and even if the fed raises rates they are expected to remain below inflation levels consequently investors are increasingly looking to silver as a store of value and a potential hedge against the risks associated with an overheated stock market in light of the stock market s prolonged rally and the federal reserve s monetary policies silver s role as a potential hedge and safe haven asset has garnered attention it serves as an alternative investment option for those concerned about the vulnerability of the stock market especially in the face of inflation and potential interest rate hikes how geopolitical events affect the silver price geopolitical events can significantly impact the price of silver as they can introduce uncertainty and drive investors towards safe haven assets recent tensions between major world powers like china and russia have raised concerns about potential economic consequences leading investors to seek refuge in precious metals including silver when geopolitical conflicts escalate there is often a flight to safety and silver known for its historical role as a store of value becomes an attractive option additionally the de dollarization efforts of countries like china and russia can influence silver prices as these nations seek to reduce their reliance on the u s dollar in global trade they may increase their holdings of alternative assets including silver this can create additional demand for the precious metal putting upward pressure on its price furthermore the threat of economic sanctions and financial warfare as discussed in the article can affect the value of silver when countries face sanctions they may turn to precious metals like silver as a means of preserving wealth and maintaining financial stability this increased demand driven by geopolitical tensions can have a direct impact on silver prices making it a valuable asset to watch for investors navigating uncertain global geopolitical landscapes beyond the silver standard decades ago the silver standard came to an end in developed countries which means silver was no longer considered legal tender a number of countries including the united states continue to mint bullion and collectible coins an example is the american silver eagle which has the nominal face value of a one dollar coin the canadian silver maple leaf coins are legal tender in canada valued at about usd 5 per coin privately minted coins are referred to as silver rounds which are not legal tender but make for a great purchase for investing in silver troy ounces however hard money enthusiasts may still use them as an investment opportunity most private silver mints and companies like the classic silvertowne have commemorative designs and have a weight of 1 troy ounce of silver while there are some that are sterling silver the current demand for silver is for industrial applications and investment purposes including bullion coins and exchange traded products there continues to be a strong market for silver around the world as evidenced by the averages and nyse site global demand global demand strongly affects silver prices and this relationship is particularly evident in key industries silver s crucial role in solar energy as a conductor in photovoltaic panels ensures its consistent demand as the world shifts towards renewable energy sources the more global society embraces solar technology the higher the demand for silver ultimately pushing its prices upward silver s significance in the electronics industry further underscores the impact of global demand on its value found in various electronic devices silver s exceptional electrical conductivity remains unmatched as technology advances and electronic applications continue to proliferate the demand for silver in these sectors rises exerting upward pressure on its price investors also contribute to the demand for silver as they turn to it as a safe haven asset during times of economic uncertainty inflation and currency devaluation when geopolitical tensions escalate or economic conditions become uncertain on a global scale the demand for silver as a store of value surges shaping its market value global demand driven by the renewable energy and electronics sectors as well as investor preferences for silver as a hedge significantly influences silver prices these factors continually evolve making silver a dynamic asset whose value responds to shifts in the global demand landscape understanding silver spot prices when investors check the nasdaq live feed in the morning or go online to visit a website to find out the current value of silver the spot price is what matters this refers to the unit price silver can be exchanged and delivered right now whether an investor is buying trading or selling silver it is important to verify the spot

current rates right before they buy precious metals they also verify the reliability of the resources they use rather than relying on a comment published by a writer who might not be aware of the spot price of silver today the money metals website is a great source for general precious metals market news content and specific information on silver zerohedge is also a good site for updates and general silver information from am to pm the latest daily charts are important to make smart purchases from dealers who reply instantly a skilled investor gets to know the markets including real time ratios on prices for oil gold and silver and has a calculator handy at all times there are also online precious metal calculators to verify an amount quoted to try to avoid a significant loss before signing any contracts or making your final purchase how is the silver spot price determined traders determine silver and gold spot prices on futures exchanges a spot contract can change hands in london and shanghai when u s markets are closed however the largest and most influential market for metals prices is the u s comex exchange site and the cme group comex app the quote for immediate settlement or purchase at any given time is effectively the spot market price spot paper prices can sometimes diverge from real world pricing in the markets for physical precious metals for example during periods of extreme stress in markets it may be impossible to purchase physical metal anywhere near the quoted spot price some premiums on retail bullion products and offers may surge as a consequence when the physical market diverges from the paper market wholesale over the counter unit prices may be more realistic than spot prices why can t i buy silver at the spot price retail silver bullion products including silver bullion bars rounds and coins carry small premiums over spot prices the premium includes minting coin costs plus the dealer s profit the premium also incorporates any wholesale premiums the dealer must pay to acquire the product why do i have to pay a premium for silver coins premiums vary according to market conditions when demand for purchasing silver is soft premiums may fall especially on secondary market products such as pre 1965 u s silver coins secondary market products items that are being resold rather than sold for the first time as brand new can often be purchased at a discount to newly minted products and very close to actual spot prices why are silver premiums so high premiums represent a combination of factors for newly minted silver coins rounds and bars the cost of manufacturing is a major factor there are some premiums for delivery depending on the company and the size of the purchase mints and refiners set manufacturing charges based on the cost of labor and equipment not on the spot price for the metal these types of costs do not follow the silver price downward or upward for that matter another factor in premiums is demand and demand for physical silver is setting records the opposite of what is happening in the markets for paper silver dealers are bidding aggressively for physical inventory putting upward pressure on premiums this dynamic is compounded by short supply when it comes to bullion products such as junk silver dating pre 1965 u s silver dimes quarters and half dollars mints and refiners aren t producing anymore both the bid and the ask premiums for the pre 1965 coins are significantly higher than in 2010 the last time silver traded below 20 oz usd the difference is in investor perceptions in 2010 silver was nearing recent highs and more people were willing to sell currently silver spot prices are less than half the 2011 highs and virtually everyone who owns pre 1965 coins is holding out for a recovery just make sure your dealer is pricing competitively and pay attention to the account premiums being offered should you wish to sell or bid beyond that higher silver premiums signal the existence of a strong market for physical silver silver coins silver rounds and silver bars and that s great news for investors silver price news

dovish fed outcome said howie lee an economist at ocbc bank there is a perfect mix of ingredients for gold s rush to the top a weak macroeconomic environment low bond yields soft dollar and rising geopolitical tensions earlier this week in a further boost for gold the u s federal reserve joined global peers such as the european central bank and the bank of japan with plans to cut interest rates to support flagging economic growth hinting at cuts beginning as early as next month this prospect has put government bonds on a bullish footing the combination of a weaker dollar falling yields and the middle east tensions have lifted gold by nearly 4 per cent so far this week its biggest rise since the week ended april 29 2016 since wednesday bullion has risen as much as us 70 gold should remain in demand as a safe haven and as a store of value said commerzbank analyst daniel briesemann however because the price has also been pushed up by speculative buying the higher the price the more attractive it is to take profits so we will see some setbacks in the near future currencies and bonds the decline of the u s dollar coupled with higher oil and gold prices boosted the loonie

as president donald trump headed to normandy to celebrate the 75th anniversary of d day president vladimir putin welcomed his chinese counterpart xi jinping in moscow where they declared a new era of sino russian friendship and cooperation on shared national interests within the beijing moscow axis china is washington s greatest economic competitor while russia wields significant political influence against us interests in europe the middle east and more recently alongside china in venezuela in a news conference during his three day visit to russia president xi commented on the us china trade war stating that protectionism and unilateral approaches are on the rise and a policy of force and hegemonism is increasingly taking hold it seems that previous western sanctions targeting russia and trump era tariffs directed at china bring the once conflicting neighbors closer together president xi even labeled president putin his best friend an action which some analysts labeled an intentional middle finger directed at washington while a china russia strategic alliance or flexible marriage of convenience plays an important economic role it also illustrates a degree of unity among the illiberal eastern powers while the us bickers with mexico on its southern border and its allies in europe about trade and security in sum political consensus in the west noticeably diverges as national interests in the east converge on positions involving the future of eurasia traditionally china and russia have utilized veto power within the united nations security council to offset us political hegemony however as suggested by president putin at the st petersburg economic forum as new political and economic power centers emerge the us dollar loses its ability to impose pressure because of the increasing role of regional currencies washington s past habits of weaponizing the us dollar against other economies are less active and will force international financial organizations to reconsider the dollar s overall function china and russia further stepped away from the us dollar last week by agreeing to expand the use of both the yuan and ruble in new bilateral trade agreements china s continual economic expansion in europe and asia through the belt and road initiative bri and russia s increased role as an opponent to us foreign policy both further a case for a more integrated eurasia europe the middle east and north africa all need massive investment to develop their agricultural industries energy sources infrastructure irrigation systems and health facilities a more active but responsible china and russia might fulfill such financial needs however a more integrated eurasia also requires increased accountability and prudence china should engage with european markets to foster responsible and long term investment without intentionally creating debt traps dumping excess capital or demanding political allegiance from debtors the united states should also immediately halt any further political destabilization of the middle east to avoid new waves of migration into europe which increase the proliferation of populist political parties an integrated eurasia would likely encourage the west to lift sanctions against russia subsequently boosting sales between moscow and the eu however russia must also develop a positive role in europe alongside china to rebrand itself as an economic and political ally instead of remaining a political destabilizer for washington to blame an integrated eurasian future will require significant compromise but on a practical level what else does xi jingling s visit to russia indicate well first trade with china remains russia s economic lifeline as sanctions remain a burden the kremlin announced that trade between china and russia increased 25 percent last year to reach 108 billion increases in oil prices pushed trade beyond the 100 billion milestone also xi attended the st petersburg international economic forum with a 1 000 strong delegation to explore investment opportunities the us is officially boycotting the event over the recent detention of michael calvey an american banker in moscow russia s sharp turn to china began in 2014 when western sanctions hoped to punish russia for its annexation of crimea and military involvement in ukraine since 2014 70 percent of russian exports to china are energy related and china exports machinery vital to oil production to replace west denied equipment additionally china and russia both share an interest in developing the arctic which due to global warming both powers identify as a critical location for oil and gas improvements and sea route developments as the arctic melts the area will evolve into a vital path for goods in and out of asia through russia with china as the primary market major agreements between the two countries also included a 1 7 billion deal between rosatom and china national nuclear power cnnp to build additional units at the xudapu nuclear plant in northeastern china and agreements between the russian direct investment fund rdif alibaba and russia s mail ru group to invest 383 million in joint e commerce ventures china s activity in the russian economy grew by 19 percent in exports last year while russia s share of china s exports stagnated at approximately 2 to 3 percent while russia is the apparent junior partner in the relationship due to its needs for new markets financing and technology improved china russia relations will likely result in a more coherent future for eurasia as a whole russia is also a key source of energy and natural resource necessary for the chinese economy xi s visit to russia led to the signing of a 400 billion natural gas deal for a 2 000 mile pipeline to stretch from eastern siberia to northeast china and a second pipeline from western siberia to xinjiang province the united states should accept these pragmatic relationships and identify its potential opportunities to develop eurasia further greater economic cooperation between china and russia follows years of agreement on foreign policy issues for example china and russia hold roughly the same views on the venezuela crisis north korea s nuclear program kosovo s international status the legitimacy of president bashar al assad s regime in syria and the iran nuclear deal russia sells its s 400 antiaircraft missile systems and su 35 jet fighters to china for deployment to the disputed south china sea both countries also oppose the us decision to withdraw from the intermediate range nuclear forces inf treaty now russia experiences western sanctions as china combats washington s tariffs alexander gabuev a fellow at the carnegie moscow center told npr s lucian kim that through sanctions it is the west and the us that drive russia into china s arms president xi s trip ended friday after the two countries signed a total of 30 government and commercial agreements with plans to link the bri and the moscow led eurasian economic union eaeu which includes russia armenia belarus kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan russia s largest mobile operator mts also agreed to allow huawei to develop russia s 5g network china and russia are also entertaining ideas for new methods of inter bank transfers and joint credit agencies supplemented by shared financial and economic infrastructure to function independently of western dominated financial institutions talks of future alternatives to both the world bank and international monetary fund including the new development bank which aims to finance projects in the brics brazil russia india china and south africa countries it seems that while the us disagrees with its partners in the west the eastern powers have never been closer
editors note this week we re running a mini series on argentina s current financial crisis with an election coming up it s an important moment to reflect on the failures of president mauricio macri s promises to restore the country s economy part 1 covers the specifics of argentina s macroeconomic policies and why a renewed alliance with the imf will only exacerbate austerity policies at the expense of the working class part 2 covers president macri s stunted efforts to bring fracking to argentina will argentina continue down this path or will the people seek out an alternative here s part 1 three and a half years after mauricio macri came to power in argentina in december 2015 on the promise of fixing the country s economy it has instead fallen into a deep recession in response the government has turned to the international monetary fund imf for help with memories of the last imf bailout still fresh in the minds of argentinians today what little credit existed in macri s early days has dried up and sky high interest rates are encouraging financial speculation over productive investment unemployment and poverty rates have risen sharply as have the number of people with basic needs unmet plunging economic activity has negatively affected fiscal revenue so meeting the zero deficit target requires new spending cuts to top it all off inflation has risen reaching almost 50 percent in 2018 economic growth and development are terms that have been virtually erased from official public discourse and policy objectives this panorama lies in stark contrast to macri s campaign promises which included reducing inflation to a single digit and a downpour of investments that would arrive from abroad when investors saw how business friendly the new government was this in turn would lead to greater stability economic growth and more jobs and all would be well again he claimed macri s election followed 12 years of center left rule under peronists néstor kirchner 2003 2007 and cristina fernández de kirchner often known as cfk 2007 2015 in the first years under the kirchners argentina s economy had improved steadily the first two kirchner administrations were marked by a strong economic recovery from the 1998 2002 recession and massive 2001 2002 crisis with high rates of economic growth sharp reductions in poverty and unemployment and a substantial upturn in real wages and consumption this resulted from a heterodox economic policy framework aimed at developing the domestic market using expansionary monetary and fiscal policy and a managed exchange rate that favored domestic consumption and production yet during cfk s second term however problems began to crop up first international commodity prices began to decline increasing pressure on argentina s foreign sector accounts in response cfk implemented exchange controls or government imposed limits on foreign currency operations which led to the development of a black market exchange rate where argentines traded pesos with dollars and other currencies as the value of their money depreciated second inconsistencies in the management of monetary and exchange rate policies resulted in inflation and appreciated exchange rates third new york judge griesa s 2012 ruling in favor of hold out vulture funds suing argentina temporarily interrupted debt service payments and access to foreign capital markets prompting fears of a government default the government struggled to respond to challenges requiring policy adjustments until it was too late furthermore sectors of the electorate became discontented with exchange controls and inflation decisively influencing the outcome of the 2015 presidential election big business and especially finance were optimistic in the face of macri s electoral victory bloomberg welcomed macri with a revealing headline wall street is in charge in argentina again they were right from his first day in office macri implemented typical neoliberal trade and finance liberalization policies removing most barriers to the free movement of goods and services and more importantly finance including eliminating exchange controls the government s hope was that by neoliberalizing the economy foreign investment would flow in and thus correct external imbalances for a country experiencing a shortage of foreign exchange this move risked making external imbalances worse the result of these policies was to flood the local market with imported goods killing local jobs and businesses and worsening the trade balance while foreign investments never materialized for the first two years the macri administration issued massive amounts of public debt to service the country s external deficit most of it denominated in foreign currency however by february 2018 foreign capital markets had largely stopped bankrolling argentina setting off a run on the peso resulting in devaluation and a surge in inflation the lack of access to foreign credit meant that argentina was headed for another default or a forced debt restructuring at best enter the imf at that point argentine authorities turned to the imf in desperation it wasn t the first time argentina turned to the imf in 2000 when after three years of recession it was unable to service its massive debt the imf conditioned its loans on fiscal spending cuts accelerating argentina s economic downturn and making the massive december 2001 crisis that followed inevitable not much has changed at the imf in the 18 years since argentina s last experience in mid june 2018 argentina had signed a three year stand by agreement for 50 billion the largest loan in the imf s history with a seriously flawed diagnostic of argentina s problems as a point of departure the conditions attached to the loan were vintage imf fiscal austerity with a zero fiscal deficit target excluding debt service payments a renewed commitment to an inflation targeting monetary policy a floating exchange rate regime and ending central bank financing of the treasury among others however by mid august 2018 after another run on the peso consumed most of the imf s first disbursement of 15 billion argentina s authorities once again turned to the imf to request a larger loan by the end of september the imf had approved a 6 3 billion extension to the original loan with new conditions attached and more importantly a substantially accelerated disbursement schedule 90 percent of the loan would be disbursed before december 2019 with presidential elections in october 2019 many interpreted this move as a clear show of imf support for macri s reelection among the new conditions was a 180 degree change in monetary and exchange rate policies the obvious failure of targeting inflation through a freely floating exchange rate framework led the imf to implement a zero growth target for the monetary base or no inflation a very recessionary tool the argentine central bank increased its nominal interest rate to more than 70 percent in order to withdraw pesos from circulation and meet the target it also implemented a floating exchange rate limited to an inflation adjusted range if the exchange rate moves outside of that range the central bank is allowed to intervene in the foreign exchange market all of this implies that imf lenders see exchange rate stability as key to lowering inflation in argentina what have been the results of argentina s new engagement with the imf in the foreword to the april 2019 world economic outlook report the imf noted that macroeconomic instability in argentina and turkey and numerous other factors have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half of 2018 since consumption investment and economic activity dropped significantly and inflation almost doubled since the agreement was signed the imf is implicitly acknowledging that its policy recommendations in argentina have failed and are contributing to the slowdown in global economic growth while the first stand by agreement enabled argentina to avoid a default and foreign creditors to get paid the second agreement incentivized capital flight by providing additional dollars to short term speculators not unlike the capital flight that led up to the 2001 2002 crisis in other words argentina is again at the edge of the abyss facing a potentially explosive economic and social situation just ahead of presidential elections in october what to expect will argentina end up going over the edge or turn around and find its way back to growth and development the answer depends in part on the outcome of the upcoming elections where there will likely be two clear alternatives the first is either macri or another candidate from within his political party macri s support and approval ratings have plunged since mid 2018 as a result many are suggesting that maría eugenia vidal governor of the province of buenos aires should run in his place regardless of who the candidate is the policy program is clear in a recent interview when asked what his economic program would be if reelected macri said he would continue with the same policies but at a faster rate one can expect greater austerity a reprivatization of the social security system labor flexibilization i e further erosion of workers rights and deeper cuts in public sector wages and employment in other words an acceleration of the downward spiral already in place with a major crisis as a likely outcome this would be the over the edge option the alternative is a candidacy centered around former president cfk who announced on may 18 that she would run for the primary elections of the peronist party as a vice presidential candidate to her former chief of staff alberto fernández cfk remains the opposition politician with the most support but while her approval rating has increased in recent months she still faces a considerable portion of the electorate who do not want her back in office while the fernández team has not spelled out an economic plan in detail they have spoken of the need to reactivate economic growth job creation and consumption and to control inflation through a social pact of citizen responsibility should they or a similar candidate win they will almost certainly have to negotiate a private debt restructuring but perhaps the most difficult negotiation will be with the imf since almost the entire loan as it stands must be paid off by the end of 2023 this will most certainly be the trickiest aspect of an opposition victory given how inflexible the imf has proven to be in these kinds of negotiations as imf managing director christine lagarde recently stated it would be foolish on the part of any candidate to turn their back to the work that is underway but hopefully argentina will do just that leave imf austerity and neoliberalism behind and more importantly learn the lesson once and for all that neoliberalism and the imf are antithetical to development alan ciblis is an argentine economist and chair of the political economy department at the universidad nacional de general sarmiento in buenos aires argentina

if trump really is a dealmaker now is the time to show it if trump really is a dealmaker now is the time to show it ian king business presenter it really should come as no surprise more than two years into his presidency when donald trump says something controversial on twitter on tuesday however the president unleashed a tweet that startled even hardened market veterans mr trump tweeted mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others what prompted this outburst was a speech in portugal given by mr draghi in which he indicated that if it needed to the ecb could introduce more measures to stimulate the eurozone economy this could be done either by further cuts in interest rates or by a resumption of the central bank s asset purchase programme known in the jargon as quantitative easing which ended late last year the tweet revealed much about how mr trump sees the world as the economist noted the outburst shows again that mr trump views interest rates and exchange rates and not just the trade tariffs he likes to brandish as weapons of economic warfare image when the ecb launched in 1998 it was based in frankfurt and modelled on the bundesbank mr trump s observation was correct in that mr draghi s speech did immediately send the euro 0 5 lower against the us dollar as well as other leading currencies such as the japanese yen and the swiss franc although it later clawed back some of those losses and it may well be that mr trump s real target was jerome powell chairman of the us federal reserve which was due to make its next decision on us interest rates the following evening the us president has been urging mr powell to cut interest rates for months but mr trump was missing the point if he genuinely did think mr draghi was deliberately trying to manipulate the euro and send it lower on the foreign exchange markets a point denied strenuously by the ecb president to applause when taking questions after his portugal speech advertisement listen to all out politics on apple podcasts google podcasts spotify spreaker the reason mr draghi is having to talk about loosening monetary policy further is for one reason only the eurozone s economy is stuttering again the ecb s latest forecast is for eurozone gdp to grow by just 1 2 this year down from 1 8 last year with growth rising to 1 4 in each of 2020 and 2021 those forecasts crucially assume an orderly exit of the united kingdom from the eu and that the current level of uncertainty regarding the future of global trade will gradually normalise in particular that there will be no further protectionist measures beyond those already announced these are quite optimistic assumptions given some of the utterances in the conservative party leadership contest and the rumblings from the white house about a further imposition of tariffs by the us for some individual eurozone members meanwhile the outlook is even worse the latest forecasts from the european commission suggest that germany the biggest and most important eurozone economy will grow by just 0 5 this year all of which adds up to a big problem for mr draghi s successor the identity of whom may become a little clearer after this week s brussels summit of eu leaders which is also set to discuss how to fill other top posts including that of european commission president german politician manfred weber is a frontrunner for the latter job if he fails to get it berlin may press for a german in the form of jens weidmann the bundesbank president to replace mr draghi when he steps down on the day britain is scheduled to leave the eu image there is only one reason mr draghi is having to talk about loosening monetary policy further berlin can reasonably argue it is time for a german to take the helm when the ecb launched in 1998 it was based in frankfurt and modelled on the bundesbank with an appropriately teutonic focus on the money supply and inflation yet the three presidents of the ecb so far have all come from outside germany the late wim duisenberg a dutchman jean claude trichet a frenchman and mr draghi an italian but mr weidmann s appointment would horrify the highly indebted southern members of the eurozone such as italy who fear he would be less likely to sanction unorthodox measures like the ones mr draghi did in 2012 to stop the eurozone from blowing apart as david owen chief european economist at the stockbroker and investment bank jefferies international puts it weidmann has a reputation as a policy hawk and is someone who in the past has been sceptical about the merits of qe and negative interest rates he would be a more controversial appointment than anxiety about a crash in stock markets is rising while with interest rates already negative in the eurozone japan switzerland and sweden there is very little many central banks could do in the event of another collapse in global growth if mr weidmann does get the nod his supposed hawkishness could quickly be tested if inflation in the eurozone continues to be weak and further easing becomes necessary that is certainly what bond markets are betting on research published by barclays this week revealed that an astounding 12trn 9 5trn worth of bonds worldwide are now trading with a negative yield in other words investors buying such bonds are effectively paying the bond issuer mainly governments but also some companies for the privilege of lending to them some of that debt has been issued by countries from outside the eurozone such as denmark sweden switzerland and japan but a big slug of it was issued by eurozone members data on tradeweb the international trading platform revealed yesterday that more than half of all debt issued by eurozone governments around 4 3trn 3 8trn worth is now trading on a negative yield some 88 of every 100 worth of debt issued by germany is trading on a negative yield with finland and the netherlands close behind think through the logical implications of that any investor buying these bonds and holding them until they mature is guaranteed to lose money on their investment that tells you one of two things one is that because yields fall as the price rises investors are piling into bonds in anticipation of more qe from the likes of the ecb and the price rising further the other is that investors are deeply pessimistic about the state of the global economy due to concerns over the trade war tensions in the middle east and weaker corporate profits driving them into safety play investments like government bonds image investors are piling into bonds in anticipation of more qe from the likes of the ecb and the price rising further according to the latest monthly global fund manager survey by bank of america merrill lynch published this week professional investors are more pessimistic than at any point since the financial crisis anxiety about a crash in stock markets is rising while with interest rates already negative in the eurozone japan switzerland and sweden there is very little many central banks could do in the event of another collapse in global growth this in turn takes us back to mr trump the slowdown in global growth so worrying investors is due in no small part to the trade war with china on which he has embarked and the tariffs he is cheerfully erecting so the best way to stop mr draghi from resorting to more qe would be for mr trump to agree with china one of those deals he keeps insisting he is so good at sky views is a series of comment pieces by sky news editors and correspondents published every morning previously on sky views rowland manthorpe what if whisper it 5g doesn t matter

and a june flash manufacturing pmi that remained below the 50 boom bust level headline cpi slipped to 0 7 in may from 0 9 in april as economists expected the core rate which excludes fresh food eased to 0 8 from 0 9 when fresh food and energy are excluded more like the us and europe core measures prices were up 0 5 from a year ago rather than 0 6 as was the case in april the flash manufacturing pmi fell to 49 5 from 49 8 and reported the first drop in new orders since june 2016 output remained firm and the order backlog is being absorbed setting the stage for a potentially difficult q3 a bright spot may be services the tertiary index for april jumped 0 9 after a 0 5 decline in march this is the largest increase since last october there are no policy implications from today s reports the bar to boj action appears a bit higher than in the us and europe the dollar tested the jpy107 level which was our technical objective of the double top pattern a 1 2 bln option struck there that expires today may have helped it steady the greenback bounced but optionality may still impact activity today in europe the dollar is above the jpy107 25 strike that holds a 605 mln expiring option and is near jpy107 50 and a 1 4 bln option that will be cut if those are not sufficient to contain the dollar there are 2 7 bln in options between jpy107 70 and jpy107 75 that should do the trick the australian dollar edged higher to a new high for the week 0 6940 to flirt with the 20 day moving average before a light bout of profit taking pushed it a bit lower initial support now is seen near 0

the local session near cny6 8770 the dollar fell about 0 7 against the yuan this week the biggest decline in five months europe there are three main talking points from europe today the tory leadership contest in the uk the flash pmi and developments in negotiating the next european commission the first is the easiest to address over the next several weeks the 160k or so members of the conservative party will now choose between johnson and hunt to succeed may after the candidate is selected the real challenge may s challenge returns the ec refuses to renegotiate the withdrawal bill there seems to be no agreement in the uk what to do next chancellor of the exchequer hammond said the only way to break the deadlock may be new elections or a referendum predictit org has a 2 3 chance that the uk does not leave at the end of october the flash eurozone pmi was not nearly as poor as draghi s pessimism would have suggested the composite pmi for the eurozone as a whole rose to 52 1 in june from 51 8 in may it is the highest since last november manufacturing edged higher 47 8 from 47 7 which reflects the global trade headwinds while the service pmi rose to 53 4 from 52 9 the best in seven months germany saw both manufacturing and service sector pmi increase but in a statistical quirk the composite was unchanged at 52 6 france did better both reports were stronger than expected and the composite rose to 52 9 from 51 3 the takeaway from the flash pmi is that there has been steady even if slow improvement through q2 the real sector did better than the surveys suggested in q1 and might do a bit worse than the surveys suggest in q2 much depends on q3 data european leaders failed to resolve their differences over the configuration of the next european commission what was agreed upon was none of the candidates leading the three main political groupings spitzenkandidaten were acceptable and it is back to square one debating and horse trading is likely over the next few weeks the euro is consolidating yesterday s surge and is straddling the 1 1300 level where 2 4 bln euro of options will be cut today since yesterday s high a little above 1 1315 was recorded the euro

hon prime minister i gave an interview from afar to this leading morning newspaper a few days ago in the interview i extricated myself from the politics of the day and endeavoured to clarify the precise proposal made in your 2019 2020 budget speech with regard to the early repayment of part of the outstanding public sector external debt drawing from the special reserve fund of the bom this letter is in response to numerous approval messages i received from informed professionals in mauritius washington dc and london who now have a better grasp of the proposed appropriation of the notional money out of the balance sheet of the bom they now share my grave concerns regarding this proposal being one of the few persons who are not only familiar with the nitty gritty details of bom operations but also with the economic consequences of every rupee that leaves the vault of the bom for circulation in the domestic monetary circuit i felt very strongly that i should enlighten the political class and the public at large as it is not given to everyone outside the bom tower and to some extent even within tower to understand the issues at stake i would have seen myself as a person devoid of any sense of belonging to and feeling for the country had i let the proposal gone misunderstood by many of us following his 360 degree interview in l express ramesh basant roi decided to write an open letter to pravind jugnauth in response to numerous approval messages from informed professionals as i have always said the distinction between the humility of central bankers made with the right timber and the arrogance of central banking is blurred it is more blurred when disagreements over policy formulation reach the boiling point i do not claim excellence nor do i claim to be gifted with an infallible oracular capacity to see clearly into the future far from it but as a well meaning citizen i laid down my arguments as forcefully as i could in the interview hon prime minister i earnestly request you to reconsider the proposal as it is certainly not in the best medium and long term interests of our financial industry and the economy as a whole indeed the public sector is carrying a staggering level of debt a gordian knot that could be cut by a sound policy package and not by decisions that are very likely to corrupt policy making right now and in the future and thus leading to a debauchery of our national currency i recall the then minister of finance hon vishnu seetanah lutchmeenaraidoo having given commitment in april 2015 to mrs christine lagarde managing director of the imf that he would bring down the debt to gdp ratio to below 60 percent by the end of 2019 i also vividly recall having advised you to effect an early repayment of a part of the external debt which you did announce in your first budget speech the decision was duly executed out of the normal revenue raising process despite a palpable reluctance expressed by a limited few at the ministry of finance credit goes to you hon prime minister i have had the experience of being governor of the bom while you were minister of finance and subsequently prime minister of the republic and minister of finance as well i am more than inclined to believe that you may not have not been fully briefed about the dangers posed in the budget proposal i am afraid you seem to have been sorely misled our small export oriented economy is finding itself in the grip of a death wish policy makers are imperatively required to carefully weigh in the medium and long term political societal economic and financial implications of the proposal i therefore wish to highlight the following points and issues regarding the proposal in a much simpler style for your appreciation the foreign exchange reserves of the bom and the special reserve fund srf are two very different animals in the balance sheet of the bom the budget speech refers to the srf it is completely silent on the forex reserves of the bom any debate about the forex reserves of the bom is absolutely irrelevant it is pointless and falls far and away from the central issue at stake hon prime minister i earnestly request you to reconsider the proposal as it is certainly not in the best medium and long term interests of the economy as a whole going by the statement made in the budget speech the debate must be centered specifically on the appropriation of the rupee denominated notional money in the srf of the bom balance sheet it is clearly proposed to appropriate the notional money by the government it s not a borrowing by the government and as such the question of interest rate does not arise it is notional money converted into freshly printed money drawn out of the balance sheet of the bom without the application of an interest rate and promise of repayment as of what economic rationale would the bom convert the notional money into printed money when situations warrant it the bom may create money but only by making advances to the government and banks but at a price and with obligations for repayment it would be beneficial to know what would be from the standpoint of monetary management and monetary policy the bom board of directors and the mpc members justification for the conversion of the notional money into freshly printed money even if the bom act is amended do the board of directors and the mpc have to stick to the amended law if in so doing it aggravates existing difficulties in monetary policy formulation and weighs on other mandated obligations of the bom are they bound to adhere to a bad piece of legislation that is very harmful to economic and financial stability and ultimately to the wellbeing of the society as a whole after all the bom act stipulates that the bom is responsible for financial stability an amendment of the bom act in the proposed direction would find itself on a collision course with the provision in the act that entrusts the bank with the responsibility of financial stability none of any step taken by the bom should recklessly undermine its own goal of maintaining financial stability an amendment of the bom act must not go against the grain of other provisions of the act the magnitude of the notional money varies with the movement in the exchange rate of the rupee if the rupee depreciates the rupee value of the forex reserves which appears on the asset side of the bom balance sheet goes up this includes the change in valuation but the change in valuation appears on the liabilities side of the bom balance sheet this is one of the reasons why we always refer to the foreign exchange reserves of the bom as gross forex reserves of the bom see the table of forex reserves of the bom monthly bulletin the title in the column is gross international reserves it s not a net figure the accumulated valuation changes in the bom balance sheet has a very conceptual significance much different in character from the valuation figures of land buildings etc in the balance sheets for other enterprises and institutions a rogue central bank can keep on increasing the value of its forex reserves in terms of local currency by depreciating the rupee thus giving the misleading impression that forex reserves are rising deducting the valuation change due to the depreciation from the figure of gross forex reserves would give the true picture of forex reserves position of the central bank conversely if the local currency appreciates the value of the central bank s external reserves would decline accordingly valuation changes would contract in the asset and liabilities statement of the bank the size of the valuation changes accumulated over the years moves up and down on a daily basis depending on the direction and amplitude of the fluctuations in the exchange rate of the rupee it is a standard central banking practice to leave this notional money on the liabilities of the bom balance sheet untouched for purposes of the government budget it is not meant for use as government revenue why first it is a theoretical or notional money it is not the profit of the central bank as is ordinarily defined it is tantamount to having recourse to the banknote printing press for the financing of government spending second instead of raising money by other means to meet expenditure politicians guided by short term political considerations do usually acquire the bad habit of opting for an easy way out which definitely is grossly out of line with prudent macro economic management the use of this notional money for any budgetary purpose necessarily means inflationary financing of the government expenditure this is the worst of all the means of deficit financing these are the main reasons why many central bank legislations have a clause that prohibits central banks from lending to government in countries where central banks are de facto independent this clause is much stronger central bank independence is less meaningful in countries that do not have a supporting fiscal responsibility act fiscal irresponsibility and central bank independence do not make good friends monetary policy has primarily one objective to achieve a low and stable inflation rate and maintain price stability fiscal policy has many objectives promote economic growth achieve and sustain economic stability and achieve equity that is fair income distribution every rupee that leaves the central bank has more than one rupee impact depending on the magnitude of the money multiplier that is why it is called high powered money in monetary economics there are several periods in the economic history of post independent mauritius that were marked by releases of high powered money on a large scale the episodic releases of the high powered money have had corrosive effects in the economy the budget proposal under reference thus completely disregards the monetary policy goal of the bom it s fiscal dominance par excellence in a liberalized financial system like ours the conduct of monetary policy by the bom is based on its balance sheets a robust balance sheet provides the bank with ample firepower to turn around the domestic financial markets in the desired direction in contrast a weak balance sheet if made weaker by miscalculated steps would eventually disempower the bom and would require government support to conduct monetary policy with taxpayers money short of government funding of the bom an important arm of macro economic policy making would be sacrificed in favour of short term political gains hon prime minister in my exit letter dated december 17 2017 addressed to you i had already highlighted some of the issues i raised in the interview a few days ago i had mentioned therein that economic policy makers are in a uniquely privileged position to size up the formidable task of improvising a way forward for mauritius in the global transition of power and ideas a global transition the finality of which is unknowable the exercise of prudence is mandatory by amending the bom act you would be opening a can of worms that would eventually harm macro economic and financial stability in ways hardly recoverable you will be paving the way for future finance ministers to have liberal recourse to the bom for free money without having to go for corrective fiscal measures in order to meet their short term political objectives once the can is opened the bom would be reduced to the level of the defunct mauritius co operative central bank ltd i have placed before you my reasoned arguments in good faith the budget proposal is a dangerous precedent if at all it is decided to proceed with the proposal regardless of the clarifications i have provided the use of the notional money would be weaponized the mauritian rupee would finally bear the brunt you would also sow the seed for lasting macro economic instability i suspect the imf may have already sought clarifications with the ministry of finance and the bom on this proposal while i am aware that finance ministers cannot produce rabbits out of their fiscal hats i would nevertheless urge you to take an educated view of the proposal and withdraw it in the best interests of the economy although you have travelled quite a distance with it if we try to preserve the past we will not be able to produce the future no more room is left to kick the can down the road anymore the sun may have already set on the government s ability to bring down its debt level without having recourse to tight measures there is nothing like a long run of good luck to destroy a person mauritius in my opinion has had a long run of good luck i extend to you my very best wishes ramesh basant roi g c s k former governor of the bank of mauritius

what is striking about donald trump s tweets against the ecb this week is how quick he was to see the significance of mario draghi s policy pirouette in sintra already dubbed whatever it takes ii by bond markets and how quickly he pounced the eurozone is the chief global parasite photo bloomberg mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years said mr trump this has the imprint of his trade guru peter navarro the dollar is of course over valued the federal reserve s broad dollar index reached a 17 year high in early june the manufacturing trade deficit has ballooned to us900 billion these imbalances have been made worse by mr trump s own policies his tax cuts at the top of cycle have pushed the budget deficit to 4 per cent of gdp they forced the fed to jam on the brakes last year this loose fiscal tight money regime is the textbook formula for a strong currency but the white house is not going to admit this it is going to blame foreigners and foreigners are not innocent either the eurozone is the chief global parasite it has been sucking demand out of the global economy with current account surpluses of 300 billion to 400 billion china is a saint by comparison this free rider behaviour is the result of the euro structure and the austerity bias of the stability pact and german ideology amplified through currency union the rest of the world pays the price advertisement mr navarro has special twist on this the warped mechanism of monetary union allows germany to keep the implicit deutsche mark grossly undervalued and to lock in a beggar thy neighbour trade advantage over southern europe the trump white house has had enough of this and the battleground is over the currency democrats are singing from the same hymn sheet presidential candidate elizabeth warren has launched a campaign of economic patriotism with active currency management the economic policy institute in washington proposes buying the bonds of any country engaged in currency manipulation to neutralise the effect this is the new world order that mario draghi faces as he tries to stop the eurozone sliding into a deflationary quagmire the ecb s market measure of inflation expectations 5 year 5 year swaps have collapsed with all the consequences this has for nominal gdp growth and italy s debt trajectory yields on 10 year bunds have crashed to minus 0 30pc the bond markets are signalling an ice age clearly the decision to shut down qe in january and declare mission accomplished when euroland was already in an industrial recession was a policy blunder it was forced upon mr draghi by hawks he is now taking revenge on the ecb s governing council with a fait accompli unless the eurozone starts to recover additional stimulus will be required he said in sintra there will be no holds barred advertisement this pledge was made without first securing the broad consent germany s christian democrats called it an alarming signal for the ecb s integrity this time mr draghi may have overreached the ecb can of course buy corporate bonds and bank debt a shield for italy it can do some stealth monetisation of public debt but plain vanilla qe at this stage is tinkering the ecb is powerless it is trying to create a sense of action but none of this has any effect says ashoka mody a former bail out chief in europe for the imf the deflationary cancer is now so deeply lodged in the eurozone that it would take helicopter money or people s qe monetary financing of public works to fight off any future global slump such action would violate the lisbon treaty and would test german political acquiescence in the euro project to destruction in truth qe in europe has always worked chiefly through devaluation the euro s trade weighted index fell 14 per cent a year after mr draghi first signalled in 2014 that bond purchases were coming that was powerful stimulus when the euro climbed back up the eurozone economy stalled it takes permanent suppression of the exchange rate to keep euroland going as the japanese discovered it is very hard for an economy with near zero inflation and a structural trade surplus to stop its exchange rate rising unless it resorts to overt currency warfare that is exactly what mr trump is not going to allow every avenue of monetary stimulus is cut off in the eurozone only fiscal stimulus a l outrance 2 per cent or 3 per cent of gdp will be enough to weather a serious crisis that too is blocked the ecb has masked the fragility over the last seven years and nobody knows when the hour of truth will come said jean pisani ferry economic adviser to france s emmanuel macron and a fellow at the bruegel think tank mario draghi s rhetorical coup in july 2012 worked only because he secured a partial approval from germany for the ecb to act as lender of last resort for italy s debt under strict conditions that immediately halted an artificial crisis the situation today is entirely different the threat is a deflationary slump the ecb has no answer to this markets thought they heard a replay of whatever it takes in mr draghi s speech and hit the buy button but economists heard another note in sintra a plaintive appeal for emu fiscal union before it is too late the exhausted monetary warrior was telling us that the ecb cannot alone save the european project a second time the telegraph london

the trade war between beijing and washington has stoked concern in financial markets that china might opt to weaponize its holdings of more than 1 1 trillion worth of u s treasuries in retaliation for the tariffs the trump administration has imposed on chinese imports often referred to as the nuclear option choosing to dump so large a pool of assets would likely destabilize world financial markets drive interest rates higher and push tensions between the world s two largest economies into uncharted territory china has been slimming its treasury securities portfolio for some time but most analysts see an aggressive reduction of its holdings as a remote possibility at most there is no evidence beijing is seriously looking to flood markets with its u s bonds here are some key points about china s treasuries portfolio how much u s debt does china own about a decade ago china overtook japan as the largest foreign holder of u s government debt its holdings stood at more than 1 12 trillion at the end of march according to u s treasury department data japan is a close second with nearly 1 08 trillion china s holdings peaked in late 2013 at nearly 1 32 trillion and have come down by about 15 since then in march they were the lowest in about two years its share of the treasury market has fallen even faster due to the steady issuance of u s debt required to finance the growing federal budget deficit the world s second biggest economy owns about 7 of the 16 18 trillion of u s public debt outstanding its lowest share in 14 years and down from a peak of 14 in 2011 still its slice of the pie is exceeded only by the u s federal reserve which owns 2 15 trillion of treasuries or 13 5 of the market treasury issuance is expected to keep accelerating following a massive tax cut enacted in december 2017 so china s share of the market will likely drop even further why does china own so much u s debt as a net exporter to the united states and the rest of the world china has the world s largest stash of foreign exchange reserves at more than 3 trillion much of that is denominated in u s dollars accumulated through its persistent trade surplus with the united states since the early 1990s a natural place for china to park a lot of those greenbacks is the u s treasury market which is by far the largest and most liquid pool of safe assets in the world also since the financial crisis of 2007 2009 u s treasuries have consistently yielded more than bonds issued by other large developed economies such as japan and germany which has been another lure what is the risk to the united states if china sells most analysts agree that large scale selling by beijing would disrupt the treasury market and other markets an abrupt shift in the balance of supply and demand could drive down treasury prices and drive up their yields which move in the opposition direction to prices that would cause a spike in borrowing costs for the u s government also because treasury yields are a benchmark for u s consumer and business credit interest rates on everything from corporate bonds to homeowners mortgages would rise likely slowing the economy such a jarring move would also erode global investors confidence in the u s dollar as the world s top reserve currency what is the risk to china if it dumps treasuries most analysts argue china has not opted to sell uncle sam s ious because a nosedive in u s bond prices also would bring down the value of china s remaining treasury holdings also china s currency the yuan is not fully free floating beijing uses its treasury holdings as a key tool to stabilize the yuan within a targeted range against the dollar in particular some critics have alleged china uses treasuries and its other currency reserves to hold down the yuan making its exports more attractive at the same time allowing the currency to cheapen too much risks other problems such as foreign capital flight any sharp depreciation in the greenback might force beijing to defend the yuan which may mean shedding more of its treasuries stake back in 2016 china s treasuries holdings fell sharply by some 200 billion from may to november of that year as the yuan depreciated on worries about the chinese economy lastly any knock on effect in the u s economy would also be felt in china because the united states is the destination for nearly a fifth of chinese exports source reuters reporting by richard leong editing by dan burns and chizu nomiyama
by we hear a lot about suicide when celebrities like anthony bourdain and kate spade die by their own hand otherwise it seldom makes the headlines that s odd given the magnitude of the problem in 2017 47 173 americans killed themselves in that single year in other words the suicide count was nearly seven times greater than the number of american soldiers killed in the afghanistan and iraq wars between 2001 and 2018 a suicide occurs in the united states roughly once every 12 minutes what s more after decades of decline the rate of self inflicted deaths per 100 000 people annually the suicide rate has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s suicides now claim two and a half times as many lives in this country as do homicides even though the murder rate gets so much more attention in other words we re talking about a national epidemic of self inflicted deaths worrisome numbers anyone who has lost a close relative or friend to suicide or has worked on a suicide hotline as i have knows that statistics transform the individual the personal and indeed the mysterious aspects of that violent act why this person why now why in this manner into depersonalized abstractions still to grasp how serious the suicide epidemic has become numbers are a necessity according to a 2018 centers for disease control study between 1999 and 2016 the suicide rate increased in every state in the union except nevada which already had a remarkably high rate in 30 states it jumped by 25 or more in 17 by at least a third nationally it increased 33 in some states the upsurge was far higher north dakota 57 6 new hampshire 48 3 kansas 45 idaho 43 alas the news only gets grimmer since 2008 suicide has ranked 10th among the causes of death in this country for americans between the ages of 10 and 34 however it comes in second for those between 35 and 45 fourth the united states also has the ninth highest rate in the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development globally it ranks 27th more importantly the trend in the united states doesn t align with what s happening elsewhere in the developed world the world health organization for instance reports that great britain canada and china all have notably lower suicide rates than the u s as do all but six countries in the european union japan s is only slightly lower world bank statistics show that worldwide the suicide rate fell from 12 8 per 100 000 in 2000 to 10 6 in 2016 it s been falling in china japan where it has declined steadily for nearly a decade and is at its lowest point in 37 years most of europe and even countries like south korea and russia that have a significantly higher suicide rate than the united states in russia for instance it has dropped by nearly 26 from a high point of 42 per 100 000 in 1994 to 31 in 2019 we know a fair amount about the patterns of suicide in the united states in 2017 the rate was highest for men between the ages of 45 and 64 30 per 100 000 and those 75 and older 39 7 per 100 000 the rates in rural counties are almost double those in the most urbanized ones which is why states like idaho kansas new hampshire and north dakota sit atop the suicide list furthermore a far higher percentage of people in rural states own guns than in cities and suburbs leading to a higher rate of suicide involving firearms the means used in half of all such acts in this country there are gender based differences as well from 1999 to 2017 the rate for men was substantially higher than for women almost four and a half times higher in the first of those years slightly more than three and a half times in the last education is also a factor the suicide rate is lowest among individuals with college degrees those who at best completed high school are by comparison twice as likely to kill themselves suicide rates also tend to be lower among people in higher income brackets the economics of stress this surge in the suicide rate has taken place in years during which the working class has experienced greater economic hardship and psychological stress increased competition from abroad and outsourcing the results of globalization have contributed to job loss particularly in economic sectors like manufacturing steel and mining that had long been mainstays of employment for such workers the jobs still available often paid less and provided fewer benefits technological change including computerization robotics and the coming of artificial intelligence has similarly begun to displace labor in significant ways leaving americans without college degrees especially those 50 and older in far more difficult straits when it comes to finding new jobs that pay well the lack of anything resembling an industrial policy of a sort that exists in europe has made these dislocations even more painful for american workers while a sharp decline in private sector union membership downfrom nearly 17 in 1983 to 6 4 today has reduced their ability to press for higher wages through collective bargaining furthermore the inflation adjusted median wage has barely budged over the last four decades even as ceo salaries have soared and a decline in worker productivity doesn t explain it between 1973 and 2017 productivity increased by 77 while a worker s average hourly wage only rose by 12 4 wage stagnation has made it harder for working class americans to get by let alone have a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents or grandparents the gap in earnings between those at the top and bottom of american society has also increased a lot since 1979 the wages of americans in the 10th percentile increased by a pitiful 1 2 those in the 50th percentile did a bit better making a gain of 6 by contrast those in the 90th percentile increased by 34 3 and those near the peak of the wage pyramid the top 1 and especially the rarefied 0 1 made far more substantial gains and mind you we re just talking about wages not other forms of income like large stock dividends expensive homes or eyepopping inheritances the share of net national wealth held by the richest 0 1 increased from 10 in the 1980s to 20 in 2016 by contrast the share of the bottom 90 shrank in those same decades from about 35 to 20 as for the top 1 by 2016 its share had increased to almost 39 the precise relationship between economic inequality and suicide rates remains unclear and suicide certainly can t simply be reduced to wealth disparities or financial stress still strikingly in contrast to the united states suicide rates are noticeably lower and have been declining in western european countries where income inequalities are far less pronounced publicly funded healthcare is regarded as a right not demonized as a pathway to serfdom social safety nets far more extensive and apprenticeships and worker retraining programs more widespread evidence from the united states brazil japan and sweden does indicate that as income inequality increases so does the suicide rate if so the good news is that progressive economic policies should democrats ever retake the white house and the senate could make a positive difference a study based on state by state variations in the u s found that simply boosting the minimum wage and earned income tax credit by 10 appreciably reduces the suicide rate among people without college degrees the race enigma one aspect of the suicide epidemic is puzzling though whites have fared far better economically and in many other ways than african americans their suicide rate is significantly higher it increased from 11 3 per 100 000 in 2000 to 15 85 per 100 000 in 2017 for african americans in those years the rates were 5 52 per 100 000 and 6 61 per 100 000 black men are 10 times more likely to be homicide victims than white men but the latter are two and half times more likely to kill themselves the higher suicide rate among whites as well as among people with only a high school diploma highlights suicide s disproportionate effect on working class whites this segment of the population also accounts for a disproportionate share of what economists anne case and angus deaton have labeled deaths of despair those caused by suicides plus opioid overdoses and liver diseases linked to alcohol abuse though it s hard to offer a complete explanation for this economic hardship and its ripple effects do appear to matter according to a study by the st louis federal reserve the white working class accounted for 45 of all income earned in the united states in 1990 but only 27 in 2016 in those same years its share of national wealth plummeted from 45 to 22 and as inflation adjusted wages have decreased for men without college degrees many white workers seem to have lost hope of success of any sort paradoxically the sense of failure and the accompanying stress may be greater for white workers precisely because they traditionally were much better off economically than their african american and hispanic counterparts in addition the fraying of communities knit together by employment in once robust factories and mines has increased social isolation among them and the evidence that it along with opioid addiction and alcohol abuse increases the risk of suicide is strong on top of that a significantly higher proportion of whites than blacks and hispanics own firearms and suicide rates are markedly higher in states where gun ownership is more widespread trump s faux populism the large increase in suicide within the white working class began a couple of decades before donald trump s election still it s reasonable to ask what he s tried to do about it particularly since votes from these americans helped propel him to the white house in 2016 he received 64 of the votes of whites without college degrees hillary clinton only 28 nationwide he beat clinton in counties where deaths of despair rose significantly between 2000 and 2015 white workers will remain crucial to trump s chances of winning in 2020 yet while he has spoken about and initiated steps aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans his speeches and tweets have never highlighted the national suicide epidemic or its inordinate impact on white workers more importantly to the extent that economic despair contributes to their high suicide rate his policies will only make matters worse the real benefits from the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act championed by the president and congressional republicans flowed to those on the top steps of the economic ladder by 2027 when the act s provisions will run out the wealthiest americans are expected to have captured 81 8 of the gains and that s not counting the windfall they received from recent changes in taxes on inheritances trump and the gop doubled the annual amount exempt from estate taxes wealth bequeathed to heirs through 2025 from 5 6 million per individual to 11 2 million or 22 4 million per couple and who benefits most from this act of generosity not workers that s for sure but every household with an estate worth 22 million or more will as for job retraining provided by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the president proposed cutting that program by 40 in his 2019 budget later settling for keeping it at 2017 levels future cuts seem in the cards as long as trump is in the white house the congressional budget office projects that his tax cuts alone will produce even bigger budget deficits in the years to come the shortfall last year was 779 billion and it is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2020 inevitably the president and congressional republicans will then demand additional reductions in spending for social programs this is all the more likely because trump and those republicans also slashedcorporate taxes from 35 to 21 an estimated 1 4 trillion in savings for corporations over the next decade and unlike the income tax cut the corporate tax has no end date the president assured his base that the big bucks those companies had stashed abroad would start flowing home and produce a wave of job creation all without adding to the deficit as it happens however most of that repatriated cash has been used for corporate stock buy backs which totaled more than 800 billion last year that in turn boosted share prices but didn t exactly rain money down on workers no surprise of course since the wealthiest 10 of americans own at least 84 of all stocks and the bottom 60 have less than 2 of them and the president s corporate tax cut hasn t produced the tsunami of job generating investments he predicted either indeed in its aftermath more than 80 of american companies stated that their plans for investment and hiring hadn t changed as a result the monthly increase in jobs has proven unremarkable compared to president obama s second term when the economic recovery that trump largely inherited began yes the economy did grow 2 3 in 2017 and 2 9 in 2018 though not 3 1 as the president claimed there wasn t however any unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before as he insisted in this year s state of the union address anyway what matters for workers struggling to get by is growth in real wages and there s nothing to celebrate on that front between 2017 and mid 2018 they actually declined by 1 63 for white workers and 2 5 for african americans while they rose for hispanics by a measly 0 37 and though trump insists that his beloved tariff hikes are going to help workers they will actually raise the prices of goods hurting the working class and other low income americans the most then there are the obstacles those susceptible to suicide face in receiving insurance provided mental health care if you re a white worker without medical coverage or have a policy with a deductible and co payments that are high and your income while low is too high to qualify for medicaid trump and the gop haven t done anything for you never mind the president s tweet proclaiming that the republican party will become the party of healthcare let me amend that actually they have done something it s just not what you d call helpful the percentage of uninsured adults which fell from 18 in 2013 to 10 9 at the end of 2016 thanks in no small measure to obamacare had risen to 13 7 by the end of last year the bottom line on a problem that literally has life and death significance for a pivotal portion of his base trump has been awol in fact to the extent that economic strain contributes to the alarming suicide rate among white workers his policies are only likely to exacerbate what is already a national crisis of epidemic proportions

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

gold scores gains as draghi and powel grow concerned super mario delivered a surprisingly dovish speech but he was shortly outshined by super jerome both key central banks have sent new signals to the markets for interpretation let s read the tea leaves and make sense of the initial reaction in the gold market draghi repeats whatever it takes in a mini version as we covered one week ago in the gold news monitor the ecb became more dovish on the june monetary policy meeting the central bank postponed the possible beginning of the interest rate hiking from the end of 2019 to the mid 2020 our assessment was that the european central bankers are getting more worried about the state of the eurozone economy and may adopt an even more dovish stance in the near future it turned out we were right we did not have to wait too long for a more forceful signal from the ecb on tuesday mario draghi delivered a mini whatever it takes speech at the annual conference in sintra portugal he said in the absence of improvement such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened additional stimulus will be required we will use all the flexibility within our mandate to fulfill our mandate and we will do so again to answer any challenges to price stability in the future we are committed and are not resigned to having a low rate of inflation forever or even for now that aim is symmetric which means that if we are to deliver that value of inflation in the medium term inflation has to be above that level at some time in the future draghi did not say actually anything new but his tone and urgency did the job the markets heard the message this time and reacted accordingly the collapsing inflation expectations rebounded the bond yields plunged for instance the german 10 year bund fell from around 0 25 to below 0 32 as the chart below shows chart 1 german 10 year government bonds from june 17 to june 19 2019 global stock markets soared while the euro dropped against the us dollar as one can see in the chart below chart 2 eur usd exchange rate from june 17 to june 19 2019 the price of gold followed suit and initially declined on tuesday only to stabilize later in the day chart 3 gold prices from june 17 to june 19 2019 even president trump reacted to draghi s speech he apparently did not like draghi s dovish comments trump tweeted mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others fed stops being patient instead it will asses economic conditions just like tuesday was draghi s day powell dominated the wednesday s headlines yesterday the fomc published the monetary policy statement from its latest meeting that took place on june 18 19 as we expected on tuesday edition of the gold news monitor the u s central bank kept its interest rates unchanged the federal funds rate remained at the target range of 2 25 to 2 50 percent consistent with its statutory mandate the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability in support of these goals the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 1 4 to 2 1 2 percent however the fomc altered its statement in a few ways first it downgraded the assessment of the economic activity from rising at solid to moderate rate the slower pace of the gdp growth should be generally positive for the gold prices but it was already recognized by the markets second although the committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes it added to the statement that uncertainties about this outlook have increased third the fed dropped its remarks about being patient instead in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective although it does not say anything about the future moves of the fed the removal of the word patient was interpreted by the markets as preparing the ground for a possible rate cut in the near future given their perceived uncertainty regarding the u s china trade war spillovers into the economy this subtle cautious look at the economy s growth path in general has been interpreted dovishly by the markets as favorable for gold dot plot shows no cut this year but the fomc statement was accompanied by the fresh economic projections the forecasts for gdp and the unemployment rate were slightly changed compared to the march economic projections the former was edged up for 2020 by 10 basis points while latter were revised downward by 10 basis points across the entire forecast horizon more importantly given the muted inflation pressure the overall pce inflation rates were revised down from 1 8 percent to 1 5 percent this year and from 2 0 percent to 1 9 percent in 2020 however the forecasts for 2021 and longer run were unchanged which indicates that the fed still believes that it will reach its inflation target over the medium term but the most interesting shifts occurred in the dot plot first of all the median assessment of appropriate level of the federal funds rate was kept unchanged at 2 4 percent this year that is contrary to market expectations but in line with our thinking that the fed is not going to cut interest rates in 2019 second the forecast for the federal funds rate in 2020 was cut from 2 6 to 2 1 percent it means that instead of one hike the us central bank is more likely to slash interest rates next year once now it gets really tricky the fomc members adjusted the expected federal funds rate in 2021 from 2 6 percent to 2 4 percent it implies that a cut in 2019 should be followed by one hike one year later does it make any sense for you for us it does not last but not least the expected longer run rate was cut from 2 8 percent to 2 5 percent it reflects the participants view that the current level of interest rates is close to the neutral level although the unemployment rate is hovering near historic lows raising questions regarding the natural unemployment rate level implications for gold the recent few days were really hot for the markets super mario delivered another dovish speech promising new interest rate cuts or fresh rounds of quantitative easing if needed draghi s remarks have serious implications for the fed now it s not only the white house that wants powell to cut interest rates the stronger dollar will also create pressure on the fomc to adopt an even more dovish stance after all in contrast to the ecb the consequences of a hawkish disappointment from powell would be even more significant and what does the fomc fresh monetary policy statement and economic projection imply for the gold market well one could say that if the market expectations of the federal funds rate path adjust to the unchanged level of the dot plot this year gold may struggle however the market bets on an upcoming interest rate cut have increased not decreased hence the gold market embraced that speculation enthusiastically as one can see in the chart below the price of gold rallied from 1 345 to 1 360 during yesterday s u s session extending gains during today s asian trading hours it seems that the markets focused on the one expected interest rate cut next year and that the fed will closely monitor the economy given muted inflation and increasing uncertainties to its outlook chart 4 gold prices on june 19 2019 moreover the u s central bank removed its reference to being patient which can be interpreted as setting the stage for a potential rate cut in the future each meeting is now a live meeting with rather a rate cut than a rate hike being bet on during his press conference powell also sent a few dovish signals for example he said the case has strengthened for more accommodative monetary policy hence super mario was eclipsed by super jerome gold did welcome the tone gapping higher on its daily chart will its gains hold thank you if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know more about the

by using force and pretending to benevolence the hegemon will certainly have a large state by using virtue and practicing benevolence the wise ruler will achieve humane authority mencius in the course of his study of the peloponnesian war thucydides the fifth century bc greek historian claimed that interstate relations are based on might not right and that states strategic interactions follow a recurrent pattern while a change in the hierarchy of weaker states does not ultimately affect a given system disturbances in the order of stronger states upset its stability he said that lesser states strive to gain power at the expense of others because stronger states hegemons do as they please while the weak suffer what they must modern thinkers theorize that hegemony has three components material power an accepted image of world order and institutions that legitimize the use of military force and observe that the united states used all three to institutionalize its hegemony after world war ii in what became known as the washington consensus the us insisted that athenian democracy is the only legitimate form of government and enforced its claim through its military the united nations the us dollar the world bank the media and numerous political technical and scientific bodies it rewarded conforming states and punished or excluded those like china that judged government legitimacy on performance rather than ideology lesser states could revise their native ideology as sweden did by abandoning pacifist socialism or attempt to universalize their own cultural values and replace the hegemon s norms as china based on its long history of world leadership is currently doing an early chinese thinker xunzi proposed that though hegemons know how to win wars the ruler who makes his own state act correctly will attain international primacy the domestic determines the international and since humane authority based on morality rather than power is superior to hegemony it is more important to win over people than territory states wishing to exercise humane authority must be the first to respect the norms they advocate and leaders of high ethical reputation and great administrative ability will attract other states to be compassionate in great matters and overlook the small makes one fit to become lord of the covenants loving friends being friendly with the great rewarding your allies and punishing those who oppose you the lord of the covenants has a definite duty and his moral standing should match it presiding over the meetings of other states grants international recognition of humane authority two centuries later confucius expressed the principle thus superiors and inferiors relate to each other like wind and grass grass must bend when the wind blows over it china s bid to re establish its leadership after a two century hiatus has been a national goal since mao warned colleagues to overtake the united states is not only possible but absolutely necessary and obligatory if we don t the chinese nation will be letting the world down and we won t be making much of a contribution to humanity if we fail we will be wiped from the face of

international bank to mobilize local savings and is developing a new reserve currency after the global financial crisis zhou xiaochuan governor of the bank of china announced the world needs an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations and able to remain stable in the long run removing the inherent deficiencies caused by using credit based national currencies he proposed special drawing rights sdrs that derive their value from a basket of world currencies nobelists c fred bergsten robert mundell and joseph stieglitz were supportive the creation of a global currency would restore a needed coherence to the international monetary system give the imf a function that would help it to promote stability and be a catalyst for international harmony to demonstrate the scheme s stability china began valuing its own currency the rmb against a basket of dollars euros yen and pounds sterling and almost immediately complaints about rmb valuation ceased the imf made its first sdr loan in 2014 the world bank issued the first sdr bond in 2016 standard chartered bank issued the first commercial sdr notes in 2017 and the world s central banks began stating reserves in sdrs in 2019 while few noticed the advent of sdrs the creation of the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib in 2015 was a sensation former us treasury secretary larry summers called it the moment the united states lost its role as the underwriter of the global economic system i can think of no event since bretton woods comparable to the combination of china s effort to establish a major new institution and the failure of the us to persuade dozens of its traditional allies starting with britain to stay out of it the aiib guarantees a trillion dollars annually in long term low interest loans for regional infrastructure poverty reduction growth and climate change mitigation and allows eurasia s four billion savers to mobilize local savings that previously had few safe or creative outlets china which contributes a full brigade of eight thousand soldiers to un peacekeeping is integrating the united nations into its plans the un unanimously adopted xi s xi s resolution to settle disputes through dialogue and resolve differences through discussion by coordinating responses to traditional and non traditional threats and opposing all forms

the people and the nobility are not devoted then even a sage king could not guarantee victory the man who is skilled at obtaining the support of the people is the man who is skilled in using military force skillfully gaining the support of the people is essence of military undertaking that is all xunzi at their present rates of increase chinese and american military budgets will reach parity in 2028 and given that chinese missiles in every weight class already outrange their american counterparts the world security scene will change irrevocably in 1949 mao warned that the country would remain insecure unconsolidated and delegitimized until it transformed both the old imperial world order and the old china the following year the us bombed coastal dandong and strafed civilians in several cities its warplanes buzzed coastal shantou and winston churchill told the world i believe in the ultimate partition of china and i mean ultimate the insults continued for decades in 1992 after the us defense department announced its mission to prevent a rival superpower emerging in asia the navy held a chinese cargo ship the yinhe at gunpoint in international waters for three weeks claiming she was carrying contraband she wasn t two years later president clinton sent the most powerful fleet ever assembled through the taiwan strait in 1998 the us dropped five precision bombs on china s embassy in belgrade killing three diplomats and seriously wounding twenty and cia director george tenet told congress it was the only target we nominated in 2014 a us navy article proposed laying offensive underwater mines along china s coast and destroying her maritime lines of communication while sending special forces to arm minorities in xinjiang and tibet in 2017 the air force reaffirmed its willingness to launch a nuclear attack on china and in 2018 the navy practiced blocking china s access to oil through the malacca strait though says defense analyst michael thim the plan china s navy had sufficient capabilities in place in 1996 such that sending carrier strike groups into the taiwan strait would be suicidal the situation has only become more challenging for the navy in recent years not because the plan has acquired an aircraft carrier of its own but because china has greatly enhanced and modernized its existing anti access area denial capabilities it has indeed strategically china applies mao s peoples war strategies in the south china sea and western navies are struggling to respond when the japanese or kmt armies arrived the local guerillas would retreat but the invading forces couldn t stay forever and when they left the pla was still there when british or american fleets arrive the coast guard and naval militia disappear and when the fleets go the boats reappear the goal is to push the philippines and vietnam to the negotiating table at which point it has won the conflict in such a situation conventional weapons become symbolic whoever shoots first loses since an f 35 can t actually shoot anything the plan can neutralize it with a fishing boat the us cannot raise its incursions to a political level that could freeze strategy while china can coordinate military legal diplomatic and economic aspects simultaneously the power of the nation state by no means consists only in its armed forces but also in its economic and technological resources in the dexterity foresight and resolution with which its foreign policy is conducted in the efficiency of its social and political organization it consists most of all in the nation itself the people their skills energy ambition discipline initiative beliefs myths and illusions and it consists further in the way all these factors are related to one another by 2015 said the rand corporation china could endanger the us navy s surface fleet a thousand miles from its coast and the chief of its indo pacific command told the senate there is no guarantee that the united states would win a future conflict with china by 2019 the navy s seventh fleet of seventy ships charged with projecting us power to the indo pacific faced three hundred plan warships two hundred missile and gun boats defending its coast and the navy expects the plan to deploy 342 warships by 2021 the plan s mastery of naval logistics is unparalleled in 2018 alone it launched fifteen new warships and began simultaneous construction of four nuclear submarines even the us navy shopping for a floating dock visited its shipyards the first line of china s naval defense the maritime militia has 180 000 ocean going fishing boats and four thousand merchant marine freighters some towing sonar detectors crewed by a million sailors transmitting detailed information about every warship on the world s oceans twenty four hours a day shore bases fuse their reports with automated transmissions from beidou positioning navigation and timing satellites and provide real time data to reporting specialists xinxiyuan trained in target information collection and identification operating vessel management platforms that collate format and forward actionable information up the plan command chain shoreside eight million coastal reservists train constantly in seamanship emergency ship repairs anti air missile defense light weapons and naval sabotage commander yang yi a woman and the youngest chief designer in naval history created the plan s front line defense fleet of three hundred type 022 houbei class fast attack missile boats they carry eight c 802 anti ship missiles with 500lb warheads that travel at 650 mph fifteen feet above the surface to targets a hundred miles away a single c 802 disabled an israeli warship in 2006 four of her boats she says are sufficient to cover the taiwan strait while sheltering behind china s coastal islands thirty type 056 frigates with a range of 2 500 miles armed with yj 83 anti ship missiles eight sam launchers and six torpedo tubes back up the patrol boats behind them are twenty type 052d arleigh burke class destroyers with sixty four missile tubes their arsenals includes unique yu 8s anti submarine missiles that fly for twenty miles then release their torpedoes into the sea naval analysts claim they are virtually undetectable until they plunge into the water near the target six type 055 heavy missile cruisers the world s most powerful surface combatants each with one hundred twenty eight tubes carry surface to air anti ship land attack and anti submarine missiles while below the surface seventy nuclear and conventional submarines carry yj 12 anti ship cruise missiles and wake homing torpedoes that deliver five hundred pound warheads at sixty mph from fifteen miles away the greatest threat however was born when the navy invited a chinese admiral on a courtesy visit to the uss nimitz upon his return the officer told colleagues i ve just seen the world s biggest target if we can t hit an aircraft carrier we can t hit anything thrifty engineers attached a new guidance system to an existing land based missile and created a new class of weapon the million dollar df 21d anti ship ballistic carrier killer it carries a half ton warhead one thousand miles then drops it vertically at 7 500 mph onto 12 billion aircraft carriers the usni says it can destroy a carrier in one strike and that there is currently no defense against it its sibling the df 26d has a range of two thousand miles in 2019 robert haddick warned china s anti ship missile capability exceeds that of the united states in terms of range speed and sensor performance captain james fanell a senior naval intelligence officer added we know that china has the most advanced ballistic missile force in the world they have the capacity to overwhelm the defensive systems we are pursuing on the ballistic front line the cm 401 is a high supersonic ballistic missile designed for rapid precision strikes against medium size ships naval task forces and offshore facilities within two hundred miles but to destroy military bases in the region the plan relies on the larger cj 10 a subsonic missile with a two thousand mile range and a half ton payload that uses inertial and satellite navigation terrain contour matching and digital scene mapping area correlation for terminal guidance with a cep of forty feet a longer ranged anti ship version the yj 100 can be air launched or fired from type 055 vertical launch tubes for conflicts close to the mainland or taiwan says the rand corporation china achieved full parity in 2017 and by 2021 will deploy more fifth generation fighters in the area than the us j 20 fighter bombers have an operational range of a thousand miles carry bigger payloads faster higher and further than america s f 22 raptor and release yj 12 anti ship cruise missiles that travel two hundred miles then deliver a thousand pound warhead in a corkscrew trajectory at supersonic speed the navy says that even against alerted warships thirty two percent of missiles score hits and a single strike will render any vessel inoperable the j 20 also carries the specialized pla 15 propelled by novel dual pulse rocket motors on a semi ballistic trajectory they home on awacs and airborne tankers loitering behind battle lines in 2015 usaf general herbert carlisle told congress that he can field two hundred f 22 raptors carrying six missiles while china s more numerous fighters each carry twelve longer ranged weapons look at the pla 15 at the range of that weapon how do we counter that following his testimony the air force canceled its e 8c awacs recapitalization explaining that they would be easy prey for the pla 15 the pla 15 s smaller sibling pla 10 is no less deadly says isis airpower specialist douglas barrie for the notional western combat aircraft pilot there is no obvious respite to be found in attempting to avoid within visual range threat of the pla 10 by keeping beyond visual range in this environment also the plaaf will be able to mount an increasingly credible challenge and at engagement ranges against some targets that would previously have been considered safe as one former us air force tanker pilot drily noted to this author that s aimed right at me from space hyperspectral detection satellites peer at submerged submarines while the enormous divine eagle high altitude stealth hunting drone reads aircraft electronic signals long before they approach their targets below them awacs whose solid state detectors have twice the range of usaf s rotating domes track hundreds of targets and integrate information from the west pacific surveillance and targeting satellite and twelve positioning satellites with ten centimeter accuracy on the ground passive and quantum radars emit no detectable signals while tracking objects for russia s s 400 antiaircraft antimissile batteries china s heavyweight icbm the road mobile df 41 is a three stage solid fueled device with a twelve to fifteen thousand mile range and a top speed of twenty thousand mph or mach 25 that carries ten independently targetable nuclear warheads and launches on four minutes warning while the df 41 is approaching the limits of icbm potential the hypersonic glide vehicle the df zf which russian defense minister dmitry rogozin compared to the first atom bombs in strategic significance is just beginning its life cycle launched sixty miles above the earth from missiles traveling sixteen thousand mph hgvs surf the stratosphere on their supersonic shockwaves and glide to their targets rand says this would make the df 41 the world s longest range missile surpassing the range of the us lgm 30 minuteman which has a reported range of 13 000 km maneuverability can potentially provide hgvs the ability to use in flight updates to attack a different target than originally planned with the ability to fly at unpredictable trajectories these missiles will hold extremely large areas at risk throughout much of their flights and congressional report concluded the very high speeds of these weapons combined with their maneuverability and ability to travel at lower radar evading altitudes would make them far less vulnerable to current missile defenses than existing missiles after the plan s successful hgv tests xiamen university s engineering department launched and recovered its own hgv in northwest china s desert in real wars boots on the ground determine final outcomes and the people s liberation army is as unconventional as its weapons combat forces elect their ncos and plan soldiers receive more political education than the rest of the world s armies combined xiaoming zhang explained the thinking behind this under the influence of confucian philosophy the concept of the just or righteous war was prevalent throughout chinese society so unlike western militaries which depend on professional ethics and training to ensure that soldiers perform their duties in war the pla opted for political indoctrination and attempted to make troops understand why a war must be fought and how it would matter to them historian william hinton says from its inception the army has been led by the party and has never played a purely military role on the contrary army cadres have always played a leading political role in 1927 mao wrote the red army fights not merely for the sake of fighting but in order to conduct xuānchuán among the people organize arm and help them establish revolutionary political power without these objectives fighting loses its meaning and the red army loses its reason for existence no matter how well armed or valorous an army is to win wars it needs the support of the citizens who pay for it and here china has an advantage china s leaders often invoke the feelings of the chinese people in international disputes and surveys reveal that their attitudes are more hawkish than dovish and younger chinese much more inclined to call on the

as heightened trade tensions force central banks around the world to take a dovish turn the fate of the us china trade talks will be determined at the g20 summit in japan the planned meeting between us president trump and chinese president xi will be the highlight of the week as investors will be hoping for a thaw in the strained relations between the two leaders central banks will not totally disappear from the limelight as the rbnz will hold its latest policy meeting and inflation data from the eurozone and the united states could provide clues to the ecb s and the fed s next moves eurozone flash inflation eyed after dovish draghi the president of the european central bank mario draghi made it pretty clear this week that if inflation fails to converge sustainably towards the ecb s target then additional stimulus will be required this puts the focus on what happens to euro area inflation in the coming months as price pressures have eased substantially this year annual inflation fell to 1 2 in may having stood above 2 late last year core inflation has also moderated with the measure that strips out food energy alcohol and tobacco prices declining to just 0 8 headline inflation is forecast to stay unchanged at 1 2 year on year when the data is released on friday other data that will be watched from the bloc next week is germany s ifo business climate index on monday and the eurozone economic sentiment index on thursday the euro s rebound against the us dollar could be capped if the inflation and business sentiment gauges disappoint as this would take the ecb closer to loosening policy uk and canadian gdp coming up the bank of england this week maintained its tightening bias even as more of its peers moved towards a rate cut however the bank lowered its forecast for q2 growth to 0 stressing the increased downside risks and raising doubts about its own forward guidance the pound fell slightly on the boe s statement and could fall again if friday s second reading of q1 gdp growth is negatively revised the bank of canada which dropped its hawkish inclination back in april could be on the verge of flagging a rate increase again after inflation rose by more than anticipated in may the next important piece of data for the boc will be friday s monthly gdp estimate for april a strong showing would further pare back market expectations of a rate cut by the boc this year and boost the canadian dollar which hit 3½ month highs versus the us dollar this week another clue could come from the bank of canada s quarterly business outlook survey due on friday rbnz to hold rates but more cuts expected the reserve bank of new zealand became the first major central bank to cut rates in the latest global shift towards looser policy following the move at the may meeting the rbnz meets again in june but is forecast to hold rates this time round recent data out of new zealand has been more or less in line with the forecasts with the economy growing by a reasonable 0 6 quarter on quarter rate in q1 however weaknesses remain such as subdued household consumption and low business confidence the closely watched business outlook survey by anz bank for june which is released on thursday a day after the rbnz decision will be a good indication of where the economy is headed in the coming months the new zealand dollar which has rebounded modestly from the near the 7 month lows it reached in late may could resume its downtrend if the rbnz signals another cut soon boj meeting summary could shed more light on policy direction the bank of japan didn t join the fed and the ecb in opening the door for policy easing at its meeting this week but the summary of opinions of that meeting to be published on friday could reveal whether board members discussed at all about expanding the boj s already large stimulus program while the bank is more likely to wait until october to see what the impact of the planned sales tax hike will be before taking any action a stronger yen could prompt policymakers to act sooner the yen has risen sharply against both the euro and the dollar over the past few days and a sustained appreciation would risk becoming a big drag on growth and inflation in terms of data the may reports for retail sales on thursday and industrial output and jobs figures on friday will be watched out of japan us pce inflation to be eyed by the fed the us will have the busiest calendar next week with plenty of data for investors to digest as they push the federal reserve to lower rates at its july meeting with markets fully convinced that a rate cut in july is a done deal a broadly strong set of indicators next week would cast doubt on the current doom and gloom about the us economy and

president xi on the sidelines of the g20 summit on june 28 and 29 was back on however expectations are not very high that the two leaders will be able to agree to anything substantial given the sudden breakdown in relations after the us accused china of breaking the deal and imposed sanctions on chinese telecom giant huawei but with economic conditions in both china and the us having deteriorated sharply since then it s likely trump and xi will at least get the ball rolling on restarting scheduled trade talks which have stalled for the past six weeks if trump and xi surprise with a major breakthrough then risk appetite is bound to receive a significant boost with equity markets likely to be the biggest beneficiaries however if the two leaders leave the g20 event without any progress fears of a global recession would only intensify keeping central banks firmly on the easing path and pulling us stocks away from their current record highs

dropping the word patience from its statement when referring to interest rates moreover the fed has expressed concern over increasing uncertainties due to trade tensions us sino tensions have been intensifying from early may just after the previous decision also the fed has stopped describing low inflation as a temporary phenomenon the central bank has taken the first step toward easing but has also refrained from painting a gloomy picture jerome powell chair of the federal reserve board of governors has expressed satisfaction over recent developments in the labor market and us consumption moreover the washington based institution s projections for interest rates still point to leaving them unchanged this year but for a rate reduction in 2020 nevertheless bond markets were quick to raise their bets for the fed to slash rates as soon as their next meeting in july several commercial banks have changed their forecast to reflect a cut of 50 basis points a double dose the us dollar dropped across the board alongside bonds yields the benchmark 10 year treasury yield dipped below 2 the lowest since november 2016 and stock markets rallied usd jpy has been tumbling down as the sell off in the us dollar beat the positive mood in markets which tends to disadvantage the yen on the other side of the pacific the bank of japan has left its policy unchanged despite enacting the loosest monetary policy in the world the boj s lack of additional stimulus contrasted the fed and pushed the yen higher exacerbating the falls governor haruhiko kuroda has expressed concern about low inflation but his words were not enough to stop the yen s ascent president donald trump who has reportedly sought legal means to replace fed chair powell has given another his own boost to stock markets by announcing a constructive telephone conversation with his chinese counterpart xi jinping the leaders have finally announced they will hold an extensive meeting on the sidelines of the g20 meeting in japan at the end of the month moreover the excellent encounter s goal is to resume trade talks between the world s largest economies the japanese yen has ignored simmering geopolitical

fed decision us sino relations are likely to the take center stage preparations toward the trump xi summit that will take place after markets have closed for the week will likely consist of upbeat

data represents investment feeds into gdp and is also watched carefully by the fed orders excluding defense and air fell by 1 according to the revised figures for april and are now projected to rise the most important indicator of the week is scheduled for thursday the final gdp read for the first quarter the second release has shown that the economy grew at a fast clip of 3 1 annualized but it came on top of meager inflation therefore the personal consumption expenditure prices component is no less important than the headline figure inflation will also be eyed on friday with the publication of the core pce price index the fed s preferred measure of inflation which is forecast to remain unchanged at 1 6 year on year below the 2 target and keeping the pressure on the central bank personal spending personal income and the final consumer sentiment from uom will also be of interest due to the timing of the release just before the week ends and it is not only the week that draws to close but also the month and the quarter money managers will rush to make last minute adjustments to their portfolios and may trigger choppy price action here are the top us events as they appear on the forex calendar japan boj meeting minutes and tokyo inflation numbers the japanese yen will likely be sensitive to any headlines related to the upcoming trump xi summit fluctuations in bond markets and any simmering tensions between the us and iran the boj s meeting minutes stand out on the japanese economic calendar the document may reveal concerns about low inflation as well as any potential

usd jpy technical analysis the downtrend resistance line has proved decisive once again usd jpy has failed to break higher and tumbled down to new five month lows momentum remains to the downside but the relative strength index on the daily chart points to oversold conditions below 30 points 107 50 provided some support in january and remains a battle line june s fresh low of 107 05 is the next support line to watch it is followed by 106 60 which was a stepping stone for the pair on its way up in april 2018 it is followed by 105 40 which was a support line in march 2018 most importantly the 2019 trough of 104 75 is a critical line to watch 107 55 provided support in early june and now switches to resistance it is followed by 108 15 that was a cushion later in the month 108 80 was the

jpy is not only suffering from oversold conditions but has probably fallen too much considering the upbeat state of the us economy and fresh hopes for a positive outcome from the trump xi summit there

file photo an attendent cleans the carpet next to u s and chinese national flags in beijing london reuters 1 trump and g19 it s been a pretty tumultuous first half and whether things calm down from here hinges on a june 28 29 summit of the g20 world powers where presidents trump and xi are expected to meet and hopefully resolve their differences on trade and tech at stake is a decision on whether washington slaps import tariffs on another 300 billion of chinese goods a scenario that goldman sachs says could sink equity markets as much as 4 it could also tip the balance between economic recovery and recession as several markets from shipping to copper sound alarm bells trump has bones to pick with other g20 leaders too he will meet turkish president tayyip erdogan who is risking u s sanctions on his country by placing an order for russian made s 400 missile defense system india mexico canada and germany have also all at different times incurred trump s wrath over trade most recently he complained about the devalued euro which he said gave european exporters an unfair edge with more and more central banks pivoting towards policy easing the issue of exchange rates looms large fears are that another currency war will further strain ties between nations japan says it will voice concern if currency moves elsewhere deviate from economic fundamentals but having just signalled readiness to ramp up stimulus it too could find itself on the receiving end of trump s anger currency and trade wars aside an actual war might be on the horizon after trump allegedly ordered a missile strike on iran before rescinding it recent oil tanker attacks in the gulf blamed by trump on iran also will be in focus graphic global trade advertisement advertisement 2 really fed up

the rate cut focus at the last fed meeting policymakers again changed price growth forecasts downward the median projection for year end core personal consumption expenditures core pce the fed s main

zone too and it will tell whether ecb chief mario draghi was right to fire his warning shot that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster story continues so far years of stimulus and record low rates have failed to work their magic and inflation has undershot the ecb s near 2 target since 2013 the rate was 1 2 in may the bank is worried but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries not least the united states and japan german and spanish inflation data is out thursday french numbers on friday are released just ahead of the flash euro zone reading

menafn investor ideas gold scores gains as draghi and powel grow concerned june 20 2019 investorideas com newswire super mario delivered a surprisingly dovish speech but he was shortly outshined by super jerome both key central banks have sent new signals to the markets for interpretation let s read the tea leaves and make sense of the initial reaction in the gold market draghi repeats whatever it takes in a mini version as we covered one week ago in thegold news monitor theecbbecame moredovishon the june monetary policy meeting the central bank postponed the possible beginning of the interest rate hiking from the end of 2019 to the mid 2020 our assessment was that the european central bankers are getting more worried about the state of the eurozone economy and may adopt an even more dovish stance in the near future it turned out we were right we did not have to wait too long for a more forceful signal from the ecb on tuesday mario draghi delivered a mini whatever it takes speech at the annual conference in sintra portugal he said in the absence of improvement such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened additional stimulus will be required we will use all the flexibility within our mandate to fulfill our mandate and we will do so again to answer any challenges to price stability in the future we are committed and are not resigned to having a low rate of inflation forever or even for now that aim is symmetric which means that if we are to deliver that value of inflation in the medium term inflation has to be above that level at some time in the future draghi did not say actually anything new but his tone and urgency did the job the markets heard the message this time and reacted accordingly the collapsinginflationexpectations rebounded thebond yieldsplunged for instance the german 10 year bund fell from around 0 25 to below 0 32 as the chart below shows chart 1 german 10 year government bonds from june 17 to june 19 2019 globalstock marketssoared while theeurodropped against theus dollar as one can see in the chart below chart 2 eur usd exchange rate from june 17 to june 19 2019 the price of gold followed suit and initially declined on tuesday only to stabilize later in the day chart 3 gold prices from june 17 to june 19 2019 even president trump reacted to draghi s speech he apparently did not like draghi s dovish comments trump tweeted mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others fed stops being patient instead it will asses economic conditions just like tuesday was draghi s day powell dominated the wednesday s headlines yesterday the fomc published themonetary policy statement from its latest meeting that took place on june 18 19 as we expected ontuesday edition of the gold news monitor the u s central bank kept its interest rates unchanged thefederal funds rateremained at the target range of 2 25 to 2 50 percent consistent with its statutory mandate the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability in support of these goals the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 1 4 to 2 1 2 percent however the fomc altered its statement in a few ways first it downgraded the assessment of the economic activity from rising at solid to moderate rate the slower pace of thegdp growthshould be generally positive for the gold prices but it was already recognized by the markets second although the committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes it added to the statement that uncertainties about this outlook have increased third the fed dropped its remarks about being patient instead in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective although it does not say anything about the future moves of the fed the removal of the word patient was interpreted by the markets as preparing the ground for a possible rate cut in the near future given their perceived uncertainty regarding the u s china trade war spillovers into the economy this subtle cautious look at the economy s growth path in general has been interpreted dovishly by the markets as favorable for gold dot plot shows no cut this year but the fomc statement was accompanied by thefresh economic projections the forecasts forgdpand theunemployment ratewere slightly changed compared to themarch economic projections the former was edged up for 2020 by 10 basis points while latter were revised downward by 10 basis points across the entire forecast horizon more importantly given the muted inflation pressure the overallpce inflation rateswere revised down from 1 8 percent to 1 5 percent this year and from 2 0 percent to 1 9 percent in 2020 however the forecasts for 2021 and longer run were unchanged which indicates that the fed still believes that it will reach its inflation target over the medium term but the most interesting shifts occurred in thedot plot first of all the median assessment of appropriate level of the federal funds rate was kept unchanged at 2 4 percent this year that is contrary to market expectations but in line with our thinking that the fed is not going to cut interest rates in 2019 second the forecast for the federal funds rate in 2020 was cut from 2 6 to 2 1 percent it means that instead of one hike the us central bank is more likely to slash interest rates next year once now it gets really tricky the fomc members adjusted the expected federal funds rate in 2021 from 2 6 percent to 2 4 percent it implies that a cut in 2019 should be followed by one hike one year later does it make any sense for you for us it does not last but not least the expected longer run rate was cut from 2 8 percent to 2 5 percent it reflects the participants view that the current level of interest rates is close to the neutral level although the unemployment rate is hovering near historic lows raising questions regarding the natural unemployment rate level implications for gold the recent few days were really hot for the markets super mario delivered another dovish speech promising new interest rate cuts or fresh rounds ofquantitative easingif needed draghi s remarks have serious implications for the fed now it s not only the white house that wantspowellto cutinterest rates the stronger dollar will also create pressure on thefomcto adopt an even more dovish stance after all in contrast to the ecb the consequences of ahawkishdisappointment from powell would be even more significant and what does the fomc fresh monetary policy statement and economic projection imply for the gold market well one could say that if the market expectations of the federal funds rate path adjust to the unchanged level of the dot plot this year gold may struggle however themarket bets on an upcoming interest rate cuthave increased not decreased hence the gold market embraced that speculation enthusiastically as one can see in the chart below the price of goldralliedfrom 1 345 to 1 360 during yesterday s u s session extending gains during today s asian trading hours it seems that the markets focused on the one expected interest rate cut next year and that the fed will closely monitor the economy given muted inflation and increasing uncertainties to its outlook chart 4 gold prices on june 19 2019 moreover the u s central bank removed its reference to being patient which can be interpreted as setting the stage for a potential rate cut in the future each meeting is now a live meeting with rather a rate cut than a rate hike being bet on during his press conference powell also sent a few dovish signals for example he said the case has strengthened for more accommodative monetary policy hence super mario was eclipsed by super jerome gold did welcome the tone gapping higher on its daily chart will its gains hold if you enjoyed the

by trump s 2020 budget proposal reflects another significant increase in military spending along with corresponding cuts in spending by federal agencies tasked with the responsibility for providing critical services and income support policies for working class and poor people trump s call for budget cuts by federal agencies is mirrored by the statutorily imposed austerity policies in most states and many municipalities those cuts represent the continuing imposition of neoliberal policies in the u s even though the a word for austerity is almost never used to describe those policies yet austerity has been a central component of state policy at every level of government in the u s and in europe for the last four decades in europe as the consequences of neoliberal policies imposed on workers began to be felt and understood the result was intense opposition however in the u s the unevenness of how austerity policies were being applied in particular the elimination or reduction in social services that were perceived to be primarily directed at racialized workers political opposition was slow to materialize today however relatively privileged workers who were silent as the neoliberal washington consensus was imposed on the laboring classes in the global south through draconian structural adjustment policies that result in severe cutbacks in state expenditures for education healthcare state employment and other vital needs have now come to understand that the neoliberal program of labor discipline and intensified extraction of value from workers did not spare them the deregulation of capital privatization of state functions from road construction to prisons the dramatic reduction in state spending that results in cuts in state supported social services and goods like housing and access to reproductive services for the poor represent the politics of austerity and the role of the neoliberal state this materialist analysis is vitally important for understanding the dialectical relationship between the general plight of workers in the u s and the bipartisan collaboration to raid the federal budget and to reduce social spending in order to increase spending on the military this perspective is also important for understanding the imposition of those policies as a violation of the fundamental human rights of workers the poor and the oppressed for the neoliberal state the concept of human rights does not exist as i have called to attention before a monumental rip off is about to take place once again both the democrats and republicans are united in their commitment to continue to feed the u s war machine with dollars extracted to the turn of 750 billion dollars from the working class and transferred to the pockets of the military industrial complex the only point of debate is now whether or not the pentagon will get the full 750 billion or around 733 billion but whether it is 750 billion or 733 billion the one sector that is not part of this debate is the public the attention of the public has been adroitly diverted by the absurd reality show that is russiagate but this week even though the budget debate has been disappeared by corporate media congress is set to begin debate on aspects of the budget and specifically on the national defense authorization act ndaa raising the alarm on this issue is especially critical at this moment as tensions escalate in the persian gulf the corporate media is once again abdicating its public responsibility to bring unbiased objective information to the public and instead is helping to generate support for war with iran the democrats who have led the way with anti iran policies over the last few decades will be under enormous pressure not to appear to be against enhancing military preparedness and are likely to find a way to give trump and the pentagon everything they want support for human rights and support for empire is an irreconcilable contradiction the assumption of post war capitalist order was that the state would be an instrument to blunt the more contradictory aspects of capitalism it would regulate the private sector provide social welfare support to the most marginal elements of working class and create conditions for full employment this was the keynesian logic and approach that informed liberal state policies beginning in the 1930s the idea of reforming human rights fits neatly into that paradigm a seen a state s legitimacy was based on the extent to which it recognized protected and fulfilled the human rights of all its citizens and residents those rights included not only the right to information assembly speech and to participation in the national political life of the nation but also the right to food water healthcare education employment substantial social security throughout life and not just as a senior citizen the counterrevolutionary program of the late 60s and 70s especially the turn to neoliberalism which began in the 70s would reject this paradigm and redefine the role of the state the obligation of the state to recognize protect and fulfill human rights was eliminated from the role of the state under neoliberalism today the consequences of four decades of neoliberalism in the global south and now in the cosmopolitan north have created a crisis of legitimacy that has made state policies more dependent on force and militarism than in any other time including the civil war and the turmoil of the 1930s the ideological glue provided by the ability of capitalism to deliver the goods to enough of the population which guaranteed loyalty and support has been severely weakened by four decades of stagnant wages increasing debt a shrinking middle class obscene economic inequality and never ending wars that have been disproportionately shouldered by the working class today contrary to the claims of capitalism to guarantee the human right to a living wage ensuring an existence worthy of human dignity the average worker is making adjusted for inflation less than in 1973 i e some 46 years ago 140 million are either poor or have low income 80 living paycheck to paycheck 34 million are still without health insurance 40 million live in official poverty and more in unofficial poverty as measured by alternative supplemental poverty spm and more than half of those over 55 years old have no retirement funds other than social security in a report philp alston the un s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights points out that the us is one of the world s wealthiest countries it spends more on national defense than china saudi arabia russia the united kingdom india france and japan combined however that choice is public expenditures must be seen in comparison to the other factors he lays out us infant mortality rates in 2013 were the highest in the developed world americans can expect to live shorter and sicker lives compared to people living in any other rich democracy and the health gap between the us and its peer countries continues to grow us inequality levels are far higher than those in most european countries in terms of access to water and sanitation the us ranks 36th in the world the youth poverty rate in the united states is the highest across the oecd with one quarter of youth living in poverty compared to less than 14 across the oecd for african americans in particular neoliberalism has meant jobs lost hollowed out communities as industries relocated first to the south and then to mexico and china the disappearance of affordable housing schools and hospital closings infant and maternal mortality at global south levels and mass incarceration as the unskilled low wage black labor has become economically redundant this is the backdrop and context for the budget debate and trump s call to cut spendings to departments of housing and urban development education labor health and human services the environmental protection agency and even the state department the u s could find 6 trillion dollars for war since 2003 and 16 trillion to bail out the banks after the financial sector crashed the economy but it can t find money to secure the human rights of the people this is the one sided class war that we find ourselves in a war with real deaths and slower systematic structural violence neither the democrats nor the republicans can be depended on to secure our rights or protect the world from the u s atrocities that responsibility falls on the people who reside at the center of the empire to not only struggle for ourselves but to put a brake on the empire s ability to spread death and destruction across the planet

as heightened trade tensions force central banks around the world to take a dovish turn the fate of the us china trade talks will be determined at the g20 summit in japan the planned meeting between us president trump and chinese president xi will be the highlight of the week as investors will be hoping for a thaw in the strained relations between the two leaders central banks will not totally disappear from the limelight as the rbnz will hold its latest policy meeting and inflation data from the eurozone and the united states could provide clues to the ecb s and the fed s next moves eurozone flash inflation eyed after dovish draghi the president of the european central bank mario draghi made it pretty clear this week that if inflation fails to converge sustainably towards the ecb s target then additional stimulus will be required this puts the focus on what happens to euro area inflation in the coming months as price pressures have eased substantially this year annual inflation fell to 1 2 in may having stood above 2 late last year core inflation has also moderated with the measure that strips out food energy alcohol and tobacco prices declining to just 0 8 headline inflation is forecast to stay unchanged at 1 2 year on year when the numbers are released on friday other data that will be watched from the bloc next week is germany s ifo business climate index on monday and the eurozone economic sentiment index on thursday the euro s rebound against the us dollar could be capped if the inflation and business sentiment gauges disappoint as this would take the ecb closer to loosening policy uk and canadian gdp coming up the bank of england this week maintained its tightening bias even as more of its peers moved towards a rate cut however the bank lowered its forecast for q2 growth to 0 stressing the increased downside risks and raising doubts about its own forward guidance the pound fell slightly on the boe s statement and could fall again if friday s second reading of q1 gdp growth is negatively revised the bank of canada which dropped its hawkish inclination back in april could be on the verge of flagging a rate increase again after inflation rose by more than anticipated in may the next important piece of data for the boc will be friday s monthly gdp estimate for april a strong showing would further pare back market expectations of a rate cut by the boc this year and boost the canadian dollar which hit 3½ month highs versus the us dollar this week another clue could come from the bank of canada s quarterly business outlook survey due on friday rbnz to hold rates but more cuts expected the reserve bank of new zealand became the first major central bank to cut rates in the latest global shift towards looser policy following the move at the may meeting the rbnz meets again in june but is forecast to hold rates this time round recent data out of new zealand has been more or less in line with the forecasts with the economy growing by a reasonable 0 6 quarter on quarter rate in q1 however weaknesses remain such as subdued household consumption and low business confidence the closely watched business outlook survey for june by anz bank which is released on thursday a day after the rbnz decision will be a good indication of where the economy is headed in the coming months the new zealand dollar which has rebounded modestly from the near the 7 month lows it reached in late may could resume its downtrend if the rbnz signals another cut soon boj meeting summary could shed more light on policy direction the bank of japan didn t join the fed and the ecb in opening the door for policy easing at its meeting this week but the summary of opinions of that meeting to be published on friday could reveal whether board members discussed at all about expanding the boj s already large stimulus program while the bank is more likely to wait until october to see what the impact of the planned sales tax hike will be before taking any action a stronger yen could prompt policymakers to act sooner the yen has risen sharply against both the euro and the dollar over the past few days and a sustained appreciation would risk becoming a big drag on growth and inflation in terms of data the may reports for retail sales on thursday and industrial output and unemployment on friday will be watched out of japan us pce inflation to be eyed by the fed the us will have the busiest calendar next week with plenty of data for investors to digest as they push the federal reserve to lower rates at its july meeting with markets fully convinced that a rate cut in july is a done deal a broadly strong set of indicators next week would cast doubt on the current doom and gloom about the us economy and probably result in some profit taking in the dollar crosses giving the greenback a lift after what looks set to be a very bruising week the dollar index is on track to finish the week down by 1 following the fed s dramatic dovish tilt starting the week on tuesday are new home sales and the conference board s consumer confidence index the consumer confidence index rose to 134 1 in may taking it close to last october s 18 year high it s forecast to slip to 132 0 in june durable goods orders will be the main release on wednesday they are expected to have increased by 0 2 month on month in may rebounding only marginally from the 2 1 drop in april on thursday pending home sales are due along with the final estimate of gdp growth for the first quarter no revisions are being anticipated to the annualized rate of 3 1 recorded in the second reading the biggest focus for the week though will be on the personal consumption expenditures pce report for may due on friday which of course includes the fed s preferred inflation barometer the core pce price index personal income is forecast to have risen by 0 3 m m in may slightly easing from the prior month but personal consumption is projected to have accelerated a little to 0 4 m m the core pce price index is expected to underline the muted prices pressures in the us as it s forecast to hold steady at 1 6 y y markedly below the fed s 2 target other data on friday will include the chicago pmi few hopes of trump xi breakthrough at g20 summit there was huge relief when president trump confirmed that the meeting between himself and president xi on the sidelines of the g20 summit on june 28 and 29 was back on however expectations are not very high that the two leaders will be able to agree to anything substantial given the sudden breakdown in relations after trump accused china of breaking the deal and imposed sanctions on chinese telecom giant huawei but with economic conditions in both china and the us having deteriorated sharply since then it s likely trump and xi will at least get the ball rolling on restarting scheduled trade talks which have stalled for the past six weeks if trump and xi surprise with a major breakthrough then risk appetite is bound to receive a significant boost with equity markets likely to be the biggest beneficiaries however if the two leaders leave the g20 event without any progress fears of a global recession from a prolonged trade war would only intensify keeping central banks firmly on the easing path and pulling us stocks away from their current record highs

by fabius maximus summary trump s mad efforts to start trade wars puts the us economy under stress the outcome of the 2020 elections depends on the performance of the us economy in the next 17 months how strong is the us economy is the expansion old can we predict the next recession and take fast action to mitigate it this is an update and revision of my october 2018 post this expansion has run for 120 months from the 2009 trough a tie for the longest expansion with 1991 2001 see the nber s data since 1854 the fed s gdpnow algorithm estimates q2 gdp at a still healthy 2 0 saar all expansions end in recessions when will that happen assuming trump does not start one indicators show our future professional economic forecasters see steady growth for the next 12 months unfortunately economists have little ability to predict recessions surveys of economists consensus forecast have never successfully predicted a recession for example look at the predictions made in february 2008 the consensus forecast for real gdp in 2008 was 1 8 actual was 0 1 their forecast for 2009 was 2 8 actual was 2 4 the recession had begun in december 2007 some economists predicted that a recession was likely after 2005 but being pros they were vague about when i have found nobody that predicted the collapse of the global banking system which turned a us real estate downturn into the great global recession see my series about some claims of successful forecasts here here and here let s look at some methods used to predict recessions none work well i prefer the quantitative indicators with little human input my favorite is the econbrowser recession indicator indexcreated by james hamilton econ prof at uc san diego the probability that q2 was a recession was 2 4 not terrifying there are other quantitative indicators such as the index of us leading indicators flattish since november 2010 there is also the oecd s composite leading indicator an interactive display select the nations and regions slowing below average at the low end of the non recession range the economic cycle research institute s weekly leading index looks strong these indicators show where we are none are reliable guides to the future other indicators look at the shape of the yield curve see this graph from the cleveland fed predicting 2 real gdp growth for the next 12 months the yield curve has been among the most reliable economic indicators but some economists believe it is no longer reliable these predictive tools show low odds of a recession in the immediate future let s get more granular what about the specific measures of economic activity that flood the business page they excite journalists because their volatility generates easy headlines good news bad news the end is nigh but most look ok although there are signs of weakness auto sales remain strong housing starts remain stable inventories are high but stable my favorite is the cass north american transportation freight volume index as of may volume is down year over year but still up from 2017 see the full report it is one of the warning signs amidst the mostly good news stock prices predict recessions no they don t there is a low correlation between stock prices and gdp or anything else on an ex ante basis investors in stock and bonds have no special insights either as individuals or crowds my favorite example was their inability to see wwi as it began on the other hand there are some indicators that the us stock market is grossly overvalued it might be on the verge of a bear market or even a crash the good news is that a stock market crash would have only a small effect on the economy the banks are much more important than the stock market if they crumble as they did after 1929 and 2008 then the economy crumbles too has this economic expansions grown old will it die although the numbers look fine so far is a recession likely soon because the expansion is so old non economists cosplaying economists in the news often say that this expansion is living on borrowed time glenn d rudebusch fed evp summarizes economists answer in will the economic recovery die of old age in the san francisco fed s letters 4 february 2016 he gives two graphs to answer this question first a simple mortality table shows that people grow old and die see the same graph for economic expansions back then they aged and died but the great depression and wwii taught economists about the value of economic stabilizers e g unemployment insurance plus fiscal and monetary stimulus since then the odds of recession ending each month increase only slightly over time expansions age only slowly and slightly that is progress we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us trivia note we are not in an economic recovery almost all measures of economic activity long ago passed their previous peaks this is an expansion why should we care we must stay vigilant watching the economy policy responses are slow to take effect so we need as much warning as we can get worse today we are unprepared for a downturn monetary policy is the fastest tool to fight a recession but with rates so low interest rates cuts cannot do much fiscal policy is the other big tool trump s tax cuts part of the gop s long term effort to make the rich richer and bleed the federal government will make large scale fiscal more difficult an april 2018 cbo report gave this chilling warning about trump s large and rising deficits unprecedented during an economic expansion in cbo s projections budget deficits continue increasing after 2018 rising from 4 2 of gdp this year to 5 1 in 2022 adjusted to exclude the shifts in timing that percentage has been exceeded in only five years since 1946 four of those years followed the deep 2007 2009 recession keynes recommended running fiscal deficits during recessions as a countercyclical stimulus and surpluses during expansions the gop keeps cutting taxes during expansions sending the federal deficit skyrocketing reagan did it bush jr did it now trump has done it the federal deficit was 1 1 of gdp in 2007 it zoomed during the recession as tax receipts crashed and expenditures rose e g unemployment and welfare payments and later the fiscal stimulus we will begin the next recession with a deficit of 4 5 that is insane the politics of stimulus programs will be complex and might prove disastrous during the next recession what might happen in the next recession the worst affected area in the coming stock market crash will be the san francisco bay area its biggest industry is selling dreams e g stock certificates in unprofitable companies for money an industry that i expect to crash hard in the next recession the accelerating exodus of middle class families makes the region even more vulnerable beyond that we can only guess at the dynamics of the next recession much depends on the nature of the downturn and the government s response many private and public pension systems are already weak despite the long expansion a stock market crash and long recession will push many past the point of recovery as the date at which their cash flows turn negative approaches i e more payments than contributions see this about the coming bankruptcy of government pension plans also boomers have saved too little for retirement and too much of that is in real estate and stocks both probably severe casualties of a long recession my best guess it won t be pretty my advice expect the unexpected and start preparing now what kills expansions people often confuse signs of a slowdown e g consumer confidence falls economic activity slows with the factors that cause the slowdown such as economic or political shocks a partial list includes trade wars real wars monetary policy excessive rate increases by the fed restrictions on lending breaking growth of the money supply fiscal policy large cuts in spending large tax increases and popping of big investment bubbles as with most disasters multiple errors are usually necessary a dozen mistakes plus an iceberg sank the titanic there are many links that can break in our complex world two causes are especially common in the post wwii era first the fed brakes too hard to prevent overheating sometimes overheating means a rapid rise of inflation sometimes it means full employment forcing businesses to share productivity growth with their workers profit inflation is good in bankers eyes wage inflation is bad second imbalances in the economy these can be excessive growth in government consumer or business borrowing which ends suddenly creating a shock or sector imbalances such as the tech boom and the regional real estate boom bust cycles the slow growth in real gdp after the 2008 2009 bust roughly 2 5 from 2010 2017 created few imbalances optimists cheered as the dawn of a new age the q2 growth of 4 2 saar and q3 s 3 5 just as they did in 2014 q2 of 5 2 and q3 4 9 but those micro booms fizzled as this one might estimates for q4 are about 2 7 despite the gop s massive debt fueled fiscal stimulus quite mad to do late in an economic expansion when we should be reducing the federal deficit recessions and depressions are normal thou know st it s common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity queen gertrude to hamlet act i scene 2 something will eventually end an expansion expansions are part of the business cycle along with recessions and depressions they do not represent god s judgement on our moral faults or our failure to follow the one true simple ideology of economics the us economy has been in a recession roughly 20 of the time since 1854 depressions were frequent before the creation of the fed and use of fiscal stabilizers

one of the most significant economic developments since the great recession has been the zombification of the economy a zombie company is a term introduced to the lexicon by an influential paper zombie lending and depressed restructuring in japan by economists ricardo j caballero takeo hoshi and anil k kashyap the official definition of a zombie company according to the bank for international settlements bis is a publicly traded firm that s 10 years or older with a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes ebit to interest expenses of below one more simply put zombie companies are companies that are unprofitable so unprofitable they are unable to pay even the interest on their debt out of their profits they are effectively bankrupt but kept alive by banks continuing to lend them money to pay their existing loans this phenomenon first began in japan after their real estate and stock market bubble popped in the early 1990s the cabellero et al have proposed that zombie companies are to blame for japan s lost decade s writing we propose a bank based explanation for the decade long japanese slowdown following the asset price collapse in the early 1990s large japanese banks often engaged in sham loan restructurings that kept credit flowing to otherwise insolvent borrowers which we call zombies we examine the implications of suppressing the normal competitive process whereby the zombies would shed workers and lose market share the congestion created by the zombies reduces the profits for healthy firms which discourages their entry and investment we confirm that zombie dominated industries exhibit more depressed job creation and destruction and lower productivity scale of the zombie infestation following the great recession zombie companies became a worldwide phenomenon even with today s very low interest rates more and more companies are unable to pay the interest on their debts out of profits according to the bis the share of zombie companies in the us doubled between 2007 and 2015 rising to around 10 perceent of all public companies and counterintuitively as interest rates have fallen lower and lower the number of zombie companies has increased economists ryan niladr banerjee and boris hofmann writing in the bis quarterly review describes this seemingly paradoxical result using firm level data on listed firms in 14 advanced economies we document a ratcheting up in the prevalence of zombies since the late 1980s our analysis suggests that this increase is linked to reduced financial pressure which in turn seems to reflect in part the effects of lower interest rates we further find that zombies weigh on economic performance because they are less productive and because their presence lowers investment in and employment at more productive firms in part this may be because low interest rates signify a weak banking system banks may be reluctant to allow a company to fail even if there is little hope of eventual repayment because it would be too painful to accept the losses on the loans already lent to these companies and of course the ultra low interest rates created by central banks unconventional monetary policy since 2008 keeps the costs of servicing debt low these studies likely understate the problem of zombie companies for the economy a company doesn t have to be as far gone as a zombie to be at risk of default if interest rates rise moreover as economist daniel lacalle writes at the end of the day 10 5 means that 89 5 are not zombies but that analysis would be too complacent according to moody s and standard and poor s debt repayment capacity has broadly weakened globally despite ultra low rates and ample liquidity furthermore the bis only analyses listed zombie companies but in the oecd 90 of the companies are smes small and medium enterprises and a large proportion of these smaller non listed companies are still loss making in the eurozone the ecb estimates that around 30 of smes are still in the red and the figures are smaller but not massively dissimilar in the us estimated at 20 and the uk close to 25 77 additionally corporate leverage has surged in the last three years since the bis analysis today corporate debt is now above the levels seen before the 2008 crisis in the united states image how can you kill zombies in a market economy resources are allocated according to profitably this allows resources to flow to where they are best utilized keeping companies that are unprofitable alive misallocates resources and as numerous studies have shown slows the growth of the entire economy potentially leading to stagnation as has been seen in japan since the 1990s zombie companies are kept alive only with low interest rates and or lax banking regulation but as bankers assembled last month in stockholm for the annual meeting of the international capital markets association pointed out the question is with the debt level where it is can central banks ever afford to let interest rates go back up because it will lead to a major bankruptcy wave zombie companies pose a significant challenge for central banks because in a very real sense their hands are tied they cannot raise interest rates significantly without causing a huge number of companies to go bankrupt the world now has the impossible choice of permanently reduced productivity and slower economic growth or the mass bankruptcy of a significant percentage of the economy

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com libor the world s most important number is being phased out 1 created almost 50 years ago on aug 15 1969 opening day of the woodstock music festival libor began as a floating market determined interest rate for syndicated loans but over time has become the benchmark interest rate for an estimated 350 trillion in outstanding financial arrangements around the world these contracts include public and private loans and bonds consumer financial products such as credit cards mortgages and student loans and some 200 trillion in interest rate derivatives due in large part to concern that the determination of libor formally known as intercontinental exchange libor or ice libor is based on fewer and fewer interbank transactions and therefore is an increasingly unreliable benchmark for the global financial markets regulators worldwide have been working to develop alternative benchmarks over the past few years the u s federal reserve the u k s financial conduct authority or fca and other regulators have convened industry led working groups to develop risk free rates as an alternative to libor with the goal of replacing libor by the end of 2021 in the u s the alternative reference rates committee or arrc a private industry group convened by the u s federal reserve board and the new york federal reserve bank to plan the market s transition away from u s dollar libor has selected the secured overnight financing rate or sofr as the new interest rate benchmark for u s dollar denominated transactions in bond and loan markets in the u k the sterling overnight index average or sonia has been chosen as the new interest rate benchmark for pound sterling transactions other financial markets including for transactions denominated in euro swiss franc and japanese yen have developed their own risk free rates euro overnight index average eonia swiss average rate overnight saron and tokyo overnight average rate tonar respectively differences between libor and sofr the transition away from libor by 2021 presents a series of significant challenges to the financial markets for numerous reasons many of the challenges stem from the basic differences between libor and the proposed replacement rates for example sofr first libor is an interbank unsecured lending rate whereas sofr is based on overnight transactions secured by u s treasury securities a rate considered risk free as a result libor is generally higher than sofr often by 20 basis points or more which difference often widens at times of stress in the credit markets therefore a simple switch from libor to sofr without more would mean a lower interest rate so in an existing transaction a transition from libor to sofr would require an upward adjustment referred to as a replacement benchmark spread to ensure that the pre and post amendment rate levels are compatible the negotiation between creditors and borrowers of the amount of the replacement benchmark spread may present a challenge because sofr which is tied to the securities repurchase repo market is at times subject to significant volatility particularly at month quarter and year ends in the u s the arrc is expected to recommend a specific methodology for determining the replacement benchmark spread but when amending existing contracts creditors and borrowers will be under no obligation to accept it second while libor is available for various tenors e g one month three month six month etc sofr is currently only available as an overnight rate on the website of the sofr benchmark administrator the federal reserve bank of new york for now the lack of forward looking term sofr makes corporate treasurers reluctant to agree to use sofr in their loan agreements as they cannot predict how the new benchmark will perform while private parties are developing forward sofr curves for different periods the cme group for example currently publishes one month and three month sofr futures it will take time for curves to be developed and then gain widespread market adoption finally given the absence so far of a published forward looking term sofr other methods of calculating sofr are under consideration each with its own challenges for example should sofr be accrued from the beginning of an interest period on a daily overnight basis with the final interest rate for the period only determined at the end of each interest period or should sofr instead be determined for a given interest period by compounding daily sofr for the previous one three or six month period while the first option would better reflect market interest rates during the interest period neither the creditor nor the borrower would have predictability in terms of future interest income expense many corporate treasurers would be informed immediately preceding the payment date how much interest would need to be paid raising operational back and middle office issues both for creditors and borrowers a problem compounded for those non u s borrowers required to close a foreign exchange transaction in advance to effect u s dollar payments amending existing contracts perhaps the greatest challenge to the transition from libor to sofr will be to amend the contractual terms of existing financings that are due to mature after the libor transition date an estimated 35 trillion of currently outstanding libor linked financial transactions expire after 2021 in comparison the u s national debt is 22 trillion the problem is particularly acute if prior to the parties successfully amending the contracts libor itself is no longer published or is otherwise no longer considered a reliable measure of interbank lending rates concern has been raised about so called zombie libor where libor remains in legacy contracts after the point when it is no longer supported or reported loan documents for libor based loans generally provide a definition of libor with that definition providing certain fallbacks in case libor is no longer determinable based on the method provided in the document generally a designated display page on a reuters or bloomberg rate screen however these fallbacks are particularly for many older agreements generally triggered only when libor is unavailable for example if for some reason libor is not displayed on the designated rate screen on the interest rate determination date but do not consider a scenario where libor no longer exists loan agreements also typically contain provisions that apply an alternate base rate in the event that either a libor cannot be determined b dollar deposits are not being offered in the london interbank market or c libor no longer reflects the lender s cost of funding a loan those alternate base rates are often based on the prime rate the fed funds rate plus a margin or some other agreed upon rate but these alternate rates were added as a short term solution for a temporary disruption not as long term replacements for libor in particular as those rates are often significantly more expensive than libor more recent libor definitions will generally provide a different fallback already contemplating a time when libor no longer exists and industry groups have been working to develop a consistent approach in 2018 the arrc released market consultations on potential fallback language for syndicated loans floating rate notes bilateral loans and securitizations in april 2019 the arrc published its recommendations of fallback language for syndicated loans and floating rate notes based on feedback it received from market participants even so while at least one major bank has adopted the arrc recommendations in whole fallback language is still being developed and it will be difficult for the market to develop adequate language until the uncertainties surrounding sofr are resolved loan modification itself will be a challenge even after market standard fallback language has become more fully developed loan modification negotiations for bilateral loans between lenders and sophisticated borrowers should be relatively straightforward though any discussion of a benchmark spread adjustment may be a challenge especially if negotiated at a time of market stress when libor and sofr diverge more significantly syndicated loans the documentation of which often require the approval of lenders holding 100 of the outstanding loan for any proposed modification of the method for calculating interest will be a greater challenge particularly if there are numerous members of the lending syndicate with different levels of sophistication regarding the market shift from libor to sofr in addition to the obvious libor provisions amendments may also need to be made to provisions regarding break funding make whole and increased costs among other clauses the coordination role of administrative agents will be critical but the greatest challenge will likely be to modify floating rate notes or frns that have been widely distributed as generally the approval of noteholders holding 100 of the outstanding notes is required to amend existing terms and conditions affecting interest rates to the extent a libor based frn is held by a significant number of retail investors and the terms of the frn require 100 approval for amendments and have an old style libor definition then liability management exercises such as debt for debt exchange offers should be considered to help mitigate the risk if at least in part new loan agreements prior to libor cessation for new loan agreements being entered into now and using libor as the interest rate benchmark the arrc has proposed two different approaches for making future amendments when libor ceases the amendment approach and the hardwired approach each of these approaches has slight variations when applied to syndicated loans as opposed to bilateral loans generally the amendment approach provides that upon the occurrence of a defined libor replacement trigger certain cessation or pre cessation events the lender in the case of a bilateral loan or the borrower and the administrative agent in the case of a syndicated loan will have agreed to amend the loan agreement to replace libor with an alternate benchmark rate which may include term sofr unless the other party or parties to the loan agreement for example a certain percentage of required lenders object in writing within a specified timeframe under the hardwired approach upon the occurrence of a defined libor replacement trigger libor is automatically replaced with term sofr compounded sofr or another alternate benchmark rate determined in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement using an agreed waterfall each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages generally speaking the amendment approach provides the parties with greater flexibility in establishing a rate to replace libor upon the occurrence of a libor replacement trigger however a disadvantage to the amendment approach is that the parties may not be able to agree on a replacement rate when libor replacement is triggered and in that case the existing and inadequate fallbacks will remain in the loan agreement depending on the specific wording of these fallbacks and the then current market the result will either be inadequate unduly expensive or unworkable particularly for loans having longer tenors and will inevitably in some cases lead to litigation at the same time while the hardwired approach has the advantage of not depending upon the parties reaching agreement to a replacement rate in the future at the time a libor replacement trigger occurs the parties do risk agreeing in advance to a replacement rate e g term sofr or compounded sofr that does not currently exist and may never fully develop the arrc s hardwired approach includes a required benchmark spread adjustment based on spread adjustments or adjustment methodologies published by relevant governmental bodies or isda while the amendment approach contemplates that the parties will select a benchmark spread adjustment at the time of the amendment the parties would still need to agree on the amount or the methodology for determining the amount of the adjustment though giving due consideration to certain defined factors given that libor is generally higher than sofr these spread adjustment provisions are important without such provisions borrowers and the lenders will have different incentives in determining whether a libor replacement was actually triggered with borrowers likely preferring an early switch to sofr and lenders preferring a later switch all other things being equal for this reason the arrc spent considerable effort to develop objective and knowable triggers as part of its consultations our recent experience suggests that parties are more comfortable with the amendment approach than with the hardwired approach until more information regarding replacement rates becomes available other considerations the migration away from libor presents other risks to both creditors and borrowers hedging isda is undertaking separate consultations for the derivatives markets and consulted with the market in july 2018 announcing final recommendations at the end of 2018 while isda undertook its consultations before the arrc took its own there is concern that the isda fallbacks and arrc fallbacks may not align generating worries of fallback misalignment between loans notes and their respective interest rate hedges for example unlike the arrc proposal which includes a pre cessation trigger e g a public statement by the regulator for the administrator of libor that libor is no longer representative the current isda proposal does not include pre cessation triggers accordingly loan agreements that include the arrc s pre cessation trigger may result in the replacement of libor before it has ceased to be published while any associated hedges using isda s fallback language would continue to be based on libor until it is officially discontinued another example of potential divergence between the libor replacement proposals applicable to the cash loan and derivatives markets relates to the method of determining replacement benchmark itself isda has announced that it will utilize a compounded replacement rate calculated in arrears as its fallback for derivatives to the extent the loan market adopts a forward looking term sofr or some other methodology for determining the replacement benchmark instead of a compounded sofr in arrears there will be a mismatch between loans and their associated hedges regulation for financial institutions in particular there is increased regulatory focus on ensuring that banks are prepared the financial stability board or fsb and the international organisation of securities commissions or iosco have been coordinating international efforts for interest rate benchmark reform in recent months the u s federal deposit insurance corporation focused its winter 2018 issue of supervisory insights to the end of libor while the u s securities and exchange commission has identified it as a disclosure and operational concern for both reporting companies and securities industry participants taxation in the u s a number of issues have been raised about the tax impacts of converting existing loans and other financial instruments from libor to a replacement rate for example there is concern that the conversion could result in a determination that there was a material modification of the indebtedness potentially resulting in a taxable exchange a similar concern is raised under fatca where a material modification to an existing financial instrument can cause the issue to be deemed a new issuance jeopardizing the grandfathering exemption from fatca withholding for instruments issued before july 1 2014 this would be a particular concern in the context of an older existing securitization where the documentation establishing the issue likely contains no provisions contemplating fatca withholding on april 8 2019 the arrc sent a letter to the u s treasury and the u s internal revenue service requesting formal guidance on these and similar u s tax issues potential for dispute for many of the reasons discussed above there may be instances where it will be a challenge to incorporate fallback provisions into an existing financial instrument prior to the cessation of libor because of the inability to obtain requisite consent from the relevant constituents absent a statutory or other fix that applies across the different market segments the potential for disputes in these cases is a real concern that should be considered as firms analyze their needs and objectives recommendations both creditors and borrowers should already be preparing for the transition from libor to sofr we would recommend the following first parties should take stock of their libor exposure under existing loans notes and derivatives focusing on transactions maturing after 2021 the definition of libor should be reviewed as well as the provisions for amending the terms and conditions of the regarding modification discussions with counterparties should begin as soon as possible to ensure that counterparties are also aware of the conversion from libor to sofr second parties should review standard documents that are likely to be used for future transactions such as under medium term note commercial paper or certificate of deposit programs to check whether amendments should be made in contemplation of future issues for example consideration should be given to changing existing program documentation to permit less than 100 approval for amending libor related interest rate provisions reducing the ability of small groups of holdout creditors to block necessary amendments parties should monitor developments in standard libor replacement language and the developments involving potential term sofr and replacement benchmark spread in addition given the concern that both sofr and libor fallbacks may develop in different directions between standard lending securities documentation and standard isda documentation companies should review credit and hedging documents carefully to avoid potentially costly gaps third parties particularly lenders and agents should review their internal systems to understand what adjustments may be required for loan accrual in sofr whichever sofr calculation method is ultimately used by the market back and middle office systems and procedures such as client invoicing will also need to be adapted finally parties again particularly lenders and agents should already begin advising borrowers and issuers that libor is coming to an end preparing them for the changes to come less sophisticated counterparties may need additional time to educate themselves on the upcoming changes to libor and the adoption of sofr final thoughts while 2021 may still seem well in the future the adjustments that market participants will need to make are significant and these adjustments will be undertaken while replacement rates and fallback provisions remain unresolved the time to take stock of your company s exposures and to map a path forward is now one of the last bands to perform at woodstock was blood sweat and tears if the issues raised by the transition to risk free rates remain unresolved by the end of 2021 libor may well end on a similar note originally published in law360 the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about your specific

bank is primed to cut interest rates to protect an economic expansion menaced by among other things president trump s trade war but a surging market and a newly dovish fed might be unwittingly conspiring to intensify trump s trade confrontation with china that s because armed with the confidence that stocks are rising and the fed is moving his way the president will feel less pressure to

says bill reinsch a trade expert at the center for strategic and international studies trump believes he s in an economically stronger position at home and we re hurting them more than they re hurting us xi knows he doesn t have to have an election and we do and he probably thinks trump needs a victory on trade because he doesn t have many despite making it a signature issue and probably feels trump will not go to the next tranche of tariffs because of the terrible consumer impact it would have advertisement other trade watchers are similarly bearish about prospects for a breakthrough in japan both presidents are under pressure to get a deal but both are under pressure to get a good deal doug barry of the u s china business council writes in an email so at this point we have building pressure but no clarity on when and how it will be released or as bloomberg economics chief economist tom orlik writes after noting the market and fed moves reduce pressure on trump to make a deal at the same time the incentives for trump who officially launched his reelection bid this week to stand tough on china are rising the lesson of past presidential elections is that bashing beijing is a vote winning strategy with few downsides politically speaking by contrast the concessions required to get a deal done would open up trump to criticism that he d gone soft at the last minute and at least one white house adviser on china issues said a tariff escalation may be necessary michael pillsbury a hudson institute senior fellow who consults with the administration gave even odds to the two sides agreeing to restart talks next week but in a monday appearance on fox business he said i m afraid the president may need to go to the full 25 percent on all chinese exports to america

watch now the fate of u s china trade talks could play out in the week ahead and that could set the tone for markets and the economy in the second half of the year stocks set new highs in the past week after the federal reserve signaled it was ready to cut interest rates if necessary and fed chair jerome powell said trade and the global economy are two factors the fed is watching the was on track as of friday to score a more than 17 6 gain for the first half which ends friday if it stays at that level that would be the best first half performance since 1997 when the s p was up 19 4 in the first six months the big event in the coming week has been as anticipated for weeks and it could sway sentiment for weeks to come at the end of the week the g 20 meets in osaka japan for meetings friday and saturday could go either way president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping are expected to have their own dinner meeting at the g 20 next weekend following discussions between their trade representatives that meeting could decide how trade negotiations go forward and whether the u s proceeds with another round of tariffs this time on 300 billion in goods everybody knows the trump xi meeting could go either way said marc chandler chief market strategist at bannockburn global forex i think everyone expects a new tariff freeze that the 300 billion won t go into effect the most you can hope for out of g 20 meeting is the tariffs are where they are right now and there s no more escalation that also means china will not release the list of companies they won t do business with chandler said he will be looking for signaling from trump and xi on whether they are working on a deal that would be just on the trade topics or bigger issues like north korea and differences on the south china sea i do think the g 20 is quite important in that there s not question in recent months the trade war started to really move into measures of confidence and measures of manufacturing activity said ethan harris head of global economics at bank of america merrill lynch harris said he expects a positive message with an agreement of no further escalation but probably not signs of significant progress i think the vibes coming out of it will be modestly positive he said whether there s an escalation to the next round of china tariffs is going to set the theme for the rest of the year even if tariffs on china are reversed or partly reversed at some point every time there s an escalation or temporary escalation it s another kind of blow to confidence he said harris said there s the same risk as after the trump xi meeting at the last g 20 where it was a positive tone but there was little progress afterwards and the markets then reacted negatively i think there s been this broad increased awareness from every economist that the trade war is starting to have noticeable impact further escalation with china would be quite a big signal if the trump administration puts tariffs on all the chinese products it roughly doubles the size of the trade war and it sends a very strong message that there are very few constraints on where goes next he said powell and data besides the meeting between trump and xi the market focus will be on anything that could provide clues on what the fed or even the european central bank will do after ecb president mario draghi last week basically promised a new era of easing consumer price inflation data is expected for the euro zone and on friday the u s personal consumption expenditure data is released including the pce deflator a major inflation indicator for the fed there are also a few fed speakers including powell who speaks at the council on foreign relations tuesday it s probably going to be a big picture kind of talk about the broader challenges of the fed said ethan harris head of global economics at bank of america merrill lynch they re certainly going to ask questions about political influence at the fed and he s going to dodge those i think what i m waiting for him to comment on is what it is they re looking for to determine whether they re going to cut in july or not harris said powell is not likely to say anything he did not reveal at his press briefing in the past week and the big focus will be on the lead up to the weekend g 20 falling interest rates and rising oil prices were two big factors in the market int he past week the 10 year treasury yield dipped briefly below 2 a near 3 year low as the fed signaled its willingness to cut interest rates should we get some sort of trade agreement that would be a nice pop to the market but that could take the rate cut off the table said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra stovall said the stock market will also be watching oil after its rapid run higher and the events in the middle east surrounding iran west texas intermediate futures were up more than 9 in the past week to 57 43 the old adage is every 10 increase in the price of oil takes off 20 to 25 basis points off of real gdp growth he said stovall said stocks have had a solid run so far this year but they may face some rocky times between now and the end of

gold could be about to take off image credit 2019 bloomberg finance lp every asset on the planet has been having fun since the federal reserve america s central bank made clear on wednesday that an interest rate cut is coming as early as next month share prices have surged the us market the s p 500 is at a new all time high bond prices have surged too the volume of negative yielding sovereign

don t miss the latest investment and personal finances news market analysis plus money saving tips with our free twice daily newsletter don t miss the latest investment and personal finances news market analysis plus money saving tips with our free twice daily newsletter sign up but one asset that isn t quite as used to all this adulation has also been drawing a bit of attention gold gold hasn t been as much of a duff investment as you might think gold is normally my colleague dominic frisby s patch but i m sure given all the excitement he ll forgive me for sticking my oar in this morning it s easy to dismiss gold as the asset that the recovery forgot stocks and bonds have been terribly exciting since the post financial crisis era kicked off gold on the other hand peaked in 2011 at above 1 900 an ounce eventually bottomed in late 2015 at around 1 100 and since then has done very little that s not the entire truth however it s worth remembering that since around late 2014 early 2015 the us dollar has been strong against most other global currencies so gold s rather more bullish performance since then against many global currencies has been somewhat overlooked the uk is a very obvious example with sterling taking its post brexit hammering the gold price surged from around 700 per ounce to above 1 000 it hasn t quite breached the 2011 high of not far off 1 200 but we are now back close to the 1 100 mark but it s not just the uk as mark o byrne of goldcore pointed out to me the other day gold priced in australian dollars has now broken out to a new record high it surged to above a 2 000 this week this is great news for aussie gold miners by the way so your average aussie gold owner probably couldn t give a hoot about what the gold price has been doing in us dollar terms she or he is just glad that they own the stuff however all of that said gold has now done something in us dollar terms that has everyone getting very excited dominic has written many times this year about how the 1 360 an ounce level is a big deal in technical terms it represents resistance well this week gold has just sliced through it like it wasn t there and as far as the people who watch these things are concerned that means it s party time for the yellow metal again so should you be buying the backdrop is looking good for gold while i respect technical analysis you can call it hocus pocus if you want but very few serious investors i ve met dismiss it out of hand i m not a chartist myself so i m not going to attempt to give you the technical picture here and as long suffering readers will know we reckon you should always have some gold in your portfolio for the purposes of diversification and also to provide some sort of insurance against financial disaster and if you really are worried about a full on world of capital controls or restrictions on movement or some other major disruption to civil society as we know it then gold is among the very few assets which packs a lot of value into an easily portable form you just need to make sure you can access it when you need it so you won t catch me telling you to sell all your gold at any point almost regardless of what happens although a breakthrough in alchemy might irreparably damage the case for gold also gold bugs have endured many false dawns the level of excitement generated by the current breakout even the generally gold sceptical financial times has an upbeat take on gold in its lex column today does make me think that this could easily be another so i wouldn t be running out to take a great big leveraged short term day trading punt on it in the next hour or so but that said it does also look to me as though the conditions are now ripe for gold to embark on a proper bull run in the grander scheme of things if the interest rate raising cycle is now over and it clearly is almost regardless of what happens to economic data then the runway is a lot clearer for gold a change of heart by the fed or a slide into catastrophic deflation gold hates it when real interest rates go up as i outlined here are about the only things i can think of that would make life much tougher for gold and i can t see either of them happening and in the second case you d want to own gold anyway because of the risk to the financial system so in short if you don t own gold get some if you do own gold consider whether you want to increase that in other words if you are someone who tries to actively manage their asset allocation now might be a time to overweight gold rather than underweight it and on the equities front look at gold miners i d use a fund rather than trying to pick individual winners this is a sector full of potential disasters but the nice thing is that when gold miners do take off even a fund can deliver very chunky returns in a short space of time my colleague max king looked at ways to play the gold mining sector in a recent issue of moneyweek magazine subscribe here

the forgotten physician summer 2019 america s doctors are in a bind a variety of policy changes in recent decades have created new pressures for the profession and physicians appear to be feeling the strain nearly 80 report symptoms of physician burnout a problem that has become a catchphrase in medical journals and 62 are pessimistic about the future of medicine the profession has one of the highest rates of suicide in the u s at an average of up to 400 a year it s more than double the rate of the general population and multiple studies have demonstrated that doctors suffering from burnout are far more likely to make major medical errors these trends also seem tied to a looming doctor shortage according to a recent study nearly one in five doctors intends to reduce clinical hours in the next year and more than 40 of currently active physicians will reach retirement age within the next decade meanwhile the number of older americans who will likely need more health care is expected to double by 2040 the association of american medical colleges has estimated we may be short over 120 000 physicians by 2030 while a study in the journal of the american college of surgeons predicts a deficit of up to 214 000 doctors by 2025 policymakers have been responding the recently introduced resident physician shortage reduction act would add 15 000 medical residency spots over five years lifting a cap that has been in place since 1997 similarly the opioid workforce act introduced in 2018 would create 1 000 new medicare supported residency positions to train doctors in addiction medicine and related fields the federal government has long supported residency training spending around 16 billion on graduate medical education in 2015 medical schools have also taken steps to improve their numbers new york university made headlines in august 2018 when it announced that it would be offering free tuition to all its medical students regardless of need or merit making it the only top 10 medical school to do so school officials described the initiative as a moral imperative designed to address both physician shortages and diversity other schools have reduced the duration of their programs from four years to three in a bid to make medical education more appealing while free training or shorter programs may attract more students they do not address key deterrents to remaining in medicine which today go far beyond meeting tuition payments or surviving tough residencies debates over health care understandably tend to revolve around how to get the most affordable care to the most people in their attempts to achieve quality and value through regulation however policymakers have blamed doctors for rising health care costs forced them to accept less control over their own pricing robbed them of autonomy in making medical decisions and compressed the time they can spend on patient care with onerous and sometimes dangerous data entry requirements all while expecting better health outcomes while drug companies insurers and lawmakers all have a voice in the policymaking process groups representing doctors and medical schools attract far less attention at least in part because doctors are still doing well by many measures though their incomes have steadily declined or stagnated for decades though their work can be draining their plight might not seem especially wretched when compared to that of low income patients but high quality health services depend upon high quality providers and in discussions of quality and value in medicine it is vital to remember that both quality and value are grounded in the doctor patient relationship our policies should reflect that when determining what is best for patients the health and well being of physicians matter too defining doctors ronald dworkin has written in these pages about the evolving identity of the american physician from gentleman doctor to benefactor to technician to scientist in recent years a combination of new laws and technologies have again redefined the doctor this time as a sort of data entry clerk as dr robert wachter and health policy consultant jeff goldsmith put it in the harvard business review only in health care it seems could we find a way to automate that ended up adding staff and costs a taste of what today s doctors must contend with can be found on the official website of the office of the national coordinator for health information technology one of several government sites devoted to explaining medicare to physicians regardless of whether you re reporting on the advancing care information objectives and measures or on the advancing care information transition objectives and measures using certified technology can aid you in the process it may help you attain the 25 points allocated to advancing care information reporting as part of the program using a certified ehr technology is required for reporting advancing care information measures for most clinicians and it may make your overall mips reporting easier the jargon laden instructions go on to provide links to several different webpages that discuss exceptions to these rules explain the various technologies mentioned and go into greater detail about mips itself these do not include cms s many instructions for medicare reporting and compensation which can be found on the cms website or those provided on medicare gov which is separate from cms gov given the complexity of reporting requirements it isn t surprising that physicians have begun to hire medical scribes additional administrators or consultants specially trained in health it to navigate medicare s reimbursement system the costs of these newly created positions are not covered by medicare doctors must pay for the services out of pocket or spend their working hours taking endless notes and filling out forms instead of caring for patients one large scale survey in 2016 found that of 17 236 physicians who responded only 14 said they had the time they needed to provide the highest standards of care much of the stress physicians feel comes down to the attempt to transform medicine in dworkin s words into a foolproof profession insurance companies and the government not doctors increasingly determine which tests are medically necessary and what they ought to cost while there are undoubtedly abuses within the medical profession much of the practice of medicine entails prudence and experience that is difficult to systematize but doctors seem to have been almost forgotten in debates about medical care particularly with regard to what quality means in terms of time spent with patients tests recommended and diagnoses offered how we got here in 1997 congress set the stage for nearly two decades of instability by approving the sustainable growth rate formula as part of the balanced budget act the sgr tied medicare part b payment rates to the overall growth in gdp which seemed reasonable at the time as part b spending had grown disproportionately the formula proved woefully flawed however until sgr was repealed in 2015 congress overruled its own system 17 times to avoid drastically slashing physician payments to meet target medicare expenditures based on the gdp in 2011 for instance the cuts would have amounted to over 29 at which point over 40 of physicians considered refusing to accept new medicare patients the sgr imposed across the board cuts on medicare rates regardless of the performance of individual doctors or groups deferring the cuts also had a cumulative effect to minimize the budgetary impact of the annual doc fixes congress increased the reductions to make up for the deferral of prior years before it was finally repealed doctors had faced potential cuts of 20 to 30 of their medicare based income for years making it difficult for them to plan for the future the problem was exacerbated by recessions in the early and late 2000s during which the gdp contracted while health care costs continued to rise as it turned out the disparity between the gdp and part b growth rates reflected trends that neither congress nor doctors had a clear handle on the rise in part b costs that eventually resulted in sgr rested on a number of factors at least two of which are frequently overlooked the first concerns the types of services covered by part a and part b the two components of traditional medicare part a mainly covers the cost of inpatient hospital care for seniors or disabled individuals and is a straightforward entitlement funded mostly by payroll taxes part b covers physician services outpatient hospital care and certain prescription drugs administered in an outpatient setting part b is also voluntary and is funded through a combination of premiums paid by beneficiaries general revenues and other sources it was intended and is still widely understood to cover mainly conventional non hospital care such as a regular doctor s appointment though that has changed over time this structure had unforeseen consequences as chris pope explained in this journal hospitals were transformed following the launch of medicare from being institutions of last resort to all purpose providers of medical care while the consumer price index increased by 89 from 1966 to 1976 hospital costs rose by 345 hospital insurance provided by medicare part a also increased the number of hospital patient days reimbursed according to cost by 75 this is because congress initially adopted the private health insurance sector s retrospective cost based reimbursement system to pay for hospital services from 1965 through 1983 medicare reimbursed hospitals on a per diem basis and individual hospitals had mostly free reign to calculate the costs of inpatient treatment the cost reports filed by hospitals were meant to reflect the actual price of hospital services but as pope noted medicare reimbursements were also used to bankroll major capital investments expansions of capacity staffing or technology seemingly endless government funds combined with a lack of accountability incentivized hospitals to spend with abandon and from 1970 to 1980 medicare hospital payments increased by 88 in response congress sought to curtail medicare s hospital payments by reformulating part a s payment structure instead of paying for a set of services determined by the hospitals congress tasked cms then known as the health care financing administration with implementing a prospective payment system pps a per case reimbursement mechanism under which medicare would pay a flat rate based on a patient s diagnosis with this system which congress approved in 1983 inpatient hospital cases were divided into categories called diagnosis related groups drgs medicare would decide how much a particular diagnosis ought to cost based on the drg coding system which took factors such as geography and age into account hospitals were paid according to this code regardless of how much a given hospital might end up spending on a patient this was effective in reducing medicare hospital payments which declined by 52 between 1985 and 1990 and again by 37 between 1990 and 1995 at the time part b had a less rigid payment structure so hospitals were incentivized to shift services to part b where they could many procedures that had previously required inpatient admission such as cataract removals or colonoscopies were increasingly performed on an outpatient basis the practice arrangements of many hospital based physicians such as radiologists anesthesiologists and pathologists were restructured into contractual relationships or private settings to remove these expenditures from overall hospital costs the growth of managed care most commonly in the form of health maintenance organizations also incentivized hospitals to cut costs the health maintenance organization act of 1973 spurred a major expansion of hmos which had long been opposed by many in the medical establishment in an attempt to constrain rising health care costs it authorized 375 million to support the creation and expansion of hmos required employers with 25 or more employees to offer an hmo option if they already provided health insurance to their employees and overrode state laws that restricted the establishment of hmo plans as a report from the national council on disability explains the purpose of the legislation was to stimulate greater competition within health care markets by developing outpatient alternatives to expensive hospital based treatment emphasis added by 1983 cms had approved medicare payments for some 450 procedures performed in freestanding outpatient ambulatory surgery centers by 1992 that number had risen to 2 400 the total number of such procedures paid for by medicare grew from 377 000 in 1983 to 2 5 million in 1991 most of this outpatient care is charged to part b not part a as with pps the expansion of managed care contributed to the decrease in part a s growth and the rise in part b s costs this rise was significant between 1978 and 1987 medicare physician spending per beneficiary had grown by an annual compound rate of 15 by the late 80s physician expenditures were increasing at more than double the rate of hospital expenditures but many lawmakers seemed to miss the reasons why or chose to ignore them beyond the expansion of managed care and ambulatory outpatient centers hospitals also began to purchase private physician practices and furnish them with equipment to perform additional procedures which also contributed to the transfer of charges from part a to part b by 1990 less than half of hospital surgeries were performed on an inpatient basis as a recent report to congress by the medicare payment advisory commission noted outpatient spending in 2016 rose by almost 3 billion because of rapid growth in part b drug spending and an increase in physician services billed as hospital outpatient services this increase in part reflects hospitals acquisition of physician practices emphasis added these trends were scarcely discussed in the lead up to sgr increased billing for procedures and surgeries under part b was widely understood to be an indication that private physicians were taking advantage of medicare for personal gain and no doubt some were but a large portion of this increase was due to the simple fact that hospitals had shifted services to outpatient facilities including private practices a separate important contributing factor has been the growth in expensive and complicated medical equipment which has essentially become its own industry imaging centers which offer procedures such as cat scans pet scans and mris bill for a variety of expensive discrete services under medicare s reimbursement code nuclear medicine for example which involves the injection of radioactive materials prior to imaging procedures is a costly component of such scans quest diagnostics labcorp sunrise and other groups are huge publicly traded companies that perform laboratory tests which are often billed to part b over the years part b payments have also come to include approved non physician services such as speech therapy chiropractic treatment and social work orthopedic shoes ambulance transport and medical equipment are also covered by part b medicare part b reimbursements are not simply physician fees the payments go toward services that are ancillary to or entirely separate from doctors actual tasks from 1981 to 1986 rising physician fees accounted for only about 6 of the total growth in part b expenditures per enrollee and during a freeze in part b payment rates from 1983 to 1986 total spending still increased by nearly 30 almost 75 of this growth was attributed to a greater number of discrete services per beneficiary and the aforementioned shift of services from hospitals to non hospital physicians medicare s abandoned promise these trends led to problems for doctors who soon became the focus of policymakers attention as rick mayes and robert berenson document in medicare prospective payment and the shaping of u s health care medicare won the support of physicians based on the understanding that doctors would have substantial say over government reimbursement rates but this soon changed beginning in the 1970s congress launched a series of initiatives designed to tamp down part b payments resulting in doctors diminished ability to determine charges for their own services in time the medical business model was transformed and medicare rather than doctors increasingly set standard medical billing rates it is important to understand just how much these policies undermined longstanding efforts by the american medical association and other groups to maintain physician autonomy following president harry truman s election in 1948 the ama launched a vigorous and ultimately successful campaign against national health insurance its combination of press attacks pamphlets and lobbying laid the matter to rest for the better part of two decades through both the eisenhower and kennedy presidencies it wasn t until after president lyndon johnson s landslide victory in 1964 that medicare seemed likely to pass but not without key conditions to assuage the concerns of the ama the bill included a number of provisions that created buffers between physicians and government as dr philip lee and professor richard culbertson noted in a 1996 issue of the health care financing review congress also adopted a payment method designed to attract physicians permitting them to bill what they normally charged their privately insured patients the customary prevailing and reasonable cpr charge in addition physicians were allowed to bill their patients directly through the practice of balance billing which allowed them to collect more than medicare s reasonable charge medicare also included the assurance that nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize any federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control over the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided in short doctors were promised a degree of autonomy that simply did not last in 1971 president nixon imposed wage and price controls on the general economy but particularly targeted the health industry fee increases were strictly limited in medical care which was the last segment of the economy to remain subject to these controls they were finally lifted in 1974 in 1972 professional standards review organizations were established as part of the social security act and were charged in part with determining whether items charged to medicare were medically necessary while these organizations mainly affected hospitals rather than private physicians they presented the first attempt to control the appropriateness and quality of care delivered to medicare beneficiaries and were the first in a series of federal initiatives that directly undermined the judgment of individual physicians in 1975 congress tried to modestly limit the incentives for physicians to raise their prices by establishing the medicare economic index the mei was meant to restrain the annual growth of physicians prevailing charges by re adjusting them according to overall rates of inflation this was somewhat effective in curtailing increased charges but as mayes and berenson explain it also created an extremely complicated fee schedule with some services constrained by prevailing charge limits and others not so constrained while physicians could still raise their general prices they began to receive far less in medicare allowed payments this broke the link between physicians actual charges serving as a guide for medicare payment rates among other issues it allowed policymaking preferences to creep into what was meant to be a neutral pricing tool for example the fee schedule created financial incentives for rural physicians and family doctors while essentially imposing a special tax on urban and certain specialty physicians this problem was exacerbated by the introduction of drgs in 1983 in addition to dramatically restructuring financial incentives for hospitals it also imposed a top down formula based payment system that seemed counter to the promises made by early medicare proponents in 1984 as hospitals were increasingly outsourcing their services to part b congress authorized a 15 month freeze on medicare part b payment rates that was later extended to around two years but despite the fee freeze as a 1989 study published in health affairs found the program and its beneficiaries were spending 29 5 percent more 582 versus 450 for physician services by 1986 than was the case three years earlier the major spending increases were for surgery and diagnostic tests this is at least partly attributable to the re alignment of inpatient and outpatient services and to the combination of new diagnostic imaging tests and billing codes also in 1984 congress established the participating physician and supplies program par which offered physicians a deal it presented the first attempt to directly transfer control of prices or fees from physicians to the government until par after seeing a medicare part b beneficiary physicians could write up a bill and send it either directly to the patient or to medicare if the former the patient would be responsible for full payment but could file a claim and expect to be reimbursed a certain percentage by medicare patients would still be responsible for paying charges in excess of medicare approved payments the difference is often referred to as a balance bill under the par physicians would agree to accept assignment the medicare approved charge as payment in full on all claims in exchange for expedited claims processing and a direct payment from medicare rather than from patients they would also be listed in a directory available to beneficiaries a form of advertising last they would be permitted to raise their submitted charges during the freeze while others could not though for this they traded their ability to determine payments later many physicians found this proposal offensive according to the 1987 report to congress by the physician payment review commission 80 of the physicians who had initially refused to participate in par believed doctors should always have the right to set their own prices many also felt they were being strong armed into accepting short term financial benefits during what seemed like a punitive fee freeze nevertheless many chose to participate and by january 1992 over 52 of practitioners had signed participation agreements despite these constraints on physician autonomy part b outlays continued to grow increasing from 10 1 billion in 1980 to 41 3 billion in 1990 and so the restraints continued notably in 1986 with the omnibus budget reconciliation act which placed limits on the amounts even non participating physicians meaning those who had not signed onto the par system could charge above medicare approved prices in 1989 congress effectively removed control of medicare fees from the medical profession with a mandated medicare fee schedule it applied charge limits to all physician services based annual fee updates on a target rate of increase and increased federal support for clinical effectiveness research according to the hcfa s administrator at the time gail wilensky the relative values employed by the new fee schedule and the related expenditure targets were extremely difficult to implement once this system took effect in 1992 however the results were profound for the first time medicare was able to regulate both the price of and the volume of spending on physician services even before sgr s implementation in 1997 then medicare had increasingly moved to limit physician discretion in clinical and economic matters the sgr went further however by automatically mandating a reduction in doctors fees previous measures had allowed for limited increases based on factors such as the cost of living this set off chaos in the form of 17 fevered last minute votes to keep physician payments at acceptable levels this pattern finally changed in 2015 with the passage of the medicare access and chip reauthorization act macra which repealed sgr the repeal ensured five years of stable annual fee increases of 0 5 for which the medical community seemed grateful this reprieve merely served as a transition period for a new system however which would add new rules that further complicated the lives of physicians an inconvenient technology the new challenges introduced by macra were linked to the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 which had also created layers of requirements for hospitals and physician practices passed as part of president obama s 2009 stimulus bill it propose the meaningful use of interoperable electronic health records throughout the united states health care delivery system as a critical national goal meaningful use is defined in the law by the use of certified ehr technology in a meaningful manner for example electronic prescribing ensuring that the certified ehr technology is connected in a manner that provides for the electronic exchange of health information to improve the quality of care and that in using certified ehr technology the provider must submit to the secretary of health human services hhs information on quality of care and other measures the history of electronic health records and meaningful use is a sorry one for years ehr vendors spent millions in lobbying for legislation that would incentivize or compel the medical industry to purchase their products and the hitech act has been a boon for them a 2013 report from the new york times noted that glen e tullman until recently the chief executive of allscripts was health technology adviser to the 2008 obama campaign as ceo of allscripts he visited the white house no fewer than seven times after president obama took office in 2009 according to white house records since the law s passage revenues for some of the main vendors have soared sales at allscripts for example rose from 548 million in 2009 to over 1 4 billion in 2012 and sales at the cerner corporation increased by 60 over that same period today 96 of hospitals have adopted ehrs up from only 9 in 2008 the once small ehr industry is now worth 13 billion a year the hitech act was implemented in stages first physicians and hospitals were rewarded with additional medicare payments in exchange for purchasing and exhibiting meaningful use of ehr systems from approved suppliers beginning in 2015 physicians who did not adopt these systems were financially penalized for it despite this half of physicians chose to accept reductions in their medicare payments rather than implement what many consider to be a cumbersome time wasting and even dangerous tool particularly since as the law is phased in over time the requirements for fulfilling the definition of meaningful use will become increasingly demanding to date the federal government has poured around 36 billion into financial incentives for hospitals and other health groups to adopt ehr systems yet they are cited by physicians across the country as a leading source of anxiety a strong plurality nearly 40 of physicians selected ehrs as one of two factors they find least satisfying about medicine and over 65 reported that ehrs have detracted from their relationships with patients doctors who have adopted these systems spend less and less time on face to face medicine and more time logging notes a 2017 health affairs study found that between 2011 and 2014 primary care physicians actually spent more time on desktop medicine than with their patients according to a separate 2018 study from the physicians foundation 23 of physicians time is spent on non clinical paperwork to mitigate this problem many physicians have opted to hire medical scribes to literally follow them around taking notes for them while some have praised this option as an effective means of lightening doctors note keeping loads others criticize the burgeoning industry as archaic and unnecessary still others argue that the purpose of a diagnosis should be to further the interests of an individual patient not to bolster an it system in an attempt to cover every single possible medical outcome many diagnostic codes are absurdly precise the icd 10 coding system for example was approved in 2014 and includes among its tens of thousands of individual diagnoses sucked into jet engine initial encounter bitten by orca initial encounter injuries while knitting and crocheting and problems with in laws the pressure on doctors to use these systems is not a mere annoyance according to a bombshell investigation conducted by fortune magazine and kaiser health news thousands of patient deaths serious injuries and near misses are tied to flaws in government approved ehr systems these risks are mostly hidden from the public due to secrecy policies such as gag clauses that prevent ehr buyers from speaking out about safety issues and disastrous software installations the report which was released in march 2019 is horrifying in its detailed descriptions of seemingly unnecessary deaths amputations and other medical catastrophes caused by sluggish or simply faulty computer systems ehr vendors have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in quiet settlements over the years few cases have made the news perhaps what is most surprising is the candid regret expressed by both president obama and former vice president biden as the fortune report put it at a 2017 meeting with health care leaders in washington railed against the infuriating challenge of getting his son beau s medical records from one hospital to another according to biden i was stunned when my son for a year was battling stage 4 glioblastoma i couldn t get his records i m the vice president of the united states of america it was an absolute nightmare it was ridiculous absolutely ridiculous in a january 2017 interview with vox obama took a similar tack the fact that there are still just mountains of paperwork and the doctors still have to input stuff and the nurses are spending all their time on all this administrative work we put a big slug of money into trying to encourage everybody to digitalize to catch up with the rest of the world here and it s proven to be harder than we expected david blumenthal one of the architects of the ehr initiative under the obama administration admitted to fortune and kaiser that ehrs have not fulfilled their potential i think few would argue they have part of the problem according to the report is the systems are so confusing that errors frequently fall into a nether zone of responsibility it can be hard to tell where human error begins and the technological shortcomings end quantros a health care analytics firm reportedly logged 18 000 ehr related safety events from 2007 to 2018 a 2016 study by the leapfrog group a patient safety watchdog in washington found that hospital ehrs failed to flag potentially harmful drug orders in 39 of cases in a test simulation in 13 of those cases the mistake could have been fatal this drug ordering feature is mandatory in order for an ehr system to be certified by the government another issue is that doctors are over warned by these systems according to one study by the oregon health science university the average clinician working in the intensive care unit may be exposed to up to 7 000 ehr issued alarms per day between 85 and 99 of which are false alarms this excess of caution makes it extremely difficult for doctors to discern what truly warrants urgent attention and medical emergencies have fallen through the cracks when macra was passed in 2015 it advanced what the hitech act had started by introducing two new systems both meant to improve quality and value according to the government s understanding of those terms the first the merit based incentive payment system mips was designed as a transitional program toward the second the advanced alternative payment models apms under mips which took effect in 2017 medicare payments for physicians will be adjusted based on their scores in four categories quality resource use or cost clinical practice improvement and advancing care information physician performance in each of these measures is translated into a composite score and posted to the new federal physician compare website which was also created by macra as more information becomes available in the coming years consumers will be increasingly encouraged to look up doctors on this site to see what score they have been assigned by medicare unsurprisingly each category contains an exhaustive and difficult definition quality scores for example are based on measures that doctors have very little control over such as a certain average percent change in how quickly patients who have undergone spinal or knee surgery recover such measures largely depend on individual patients the severity of their injuries their age and their compliance with physician advice yet these quality benchmarks comprise 60 of a physician s total score the advancing care information category further pressures doctors to adopt meaningful use of ehr systems failure to do so will negatively affect their physician compare scores and this category comprises 25 of the total score though the system is designed to be lenient at first mips providers may see their medicare payments reduced by as much as 9 by 2022 if they don t comply with federal guidelines a stat news report by kip sullivan and stephen soumerai called this technocratic approach a dangerous fad citing a major study that found it actually penalized doctors for caring for the poorest and sickest patients because their quality scores suffered such crude performance measures do little to help patients or contain costs they argued despite their being wildly popular among policymakers and the insurance industry sullivan and soumerai demonstrated that early endorsers of such scoring systems cited virtually no evidence that they actually work to reduce costs or improve outcomes as a team of scholars in medical care research and review wrote these programs are being implemented in a near scientific vacuum beyond the administrative and financial headaches ehr programs pose for doctors and the substantive physical risks for patients a massive cyberattack in 2015 exposed the health data including social security numbers medical identification numbers and birth dates of 79 million people in 2018 anthem inc one of the nation s largest insurers and suppliers of ehr systems agreed to pay 16 million to the department of health and human services to settle lawsuits related to potential privacy violations this presented the largest known health care data breach in u s history and the largest sum ever collected by hhs in connection to a hacking incident but it is far from the only successful attack on ehr systems these programs are essentially mandated by law but patients are placed at risk when they fail and the hhs website contains a long list of reported data breaches restoring physician autonomy data scares and bureaucratic messes aside there is a more fundamental problem here applying the sort of menu thinking inherent to ehrs to the work of highly trained professionals seems more likely to increase risks than to contain them controlling and second guessing doctors at every turn threatens to ossify the profession rather than allowing physicians to develop professional judgment based on everyday cumulative patient oriented experience psychiatrist martin lipp in an early exploration of physician dissatisfaction argued that doctors are assaulted from within by the impossibility of knowing everything they feel they have to know and from without by a system that removes authority and forces adherence to conflicting allegiances the federal government in pursuing innumerable objectives attempting to control the budget satisfy interest groups and assure the public that it is trying to improve health care to name a few has come to look at doctors with a kind of domineering skepticism meanwhile patient trust in doctors has declined at least in part due to the changing look and feel of medicine following the ehr mandate in 1973 fewer than 15 of practicing physicians reported any doubts that they had made the right career choice by 1995 40 of doctors said they would not recommend the profession of medicine to a qualified college student and around the same percentage said they would not choose to enter medicine if they were deciding on a career again in 2018 over 62 reported feeling that doctors have little or very little ability to influence the health care system but there are signs that officials in the trump administration are taking notice of physicians objections in july 2018 cms administrator seema verma published an open letter to doctors in which she acknowledged some of the problems underlying physician burnout including the complicated and redundant processes involved in complying with ehr systems as well as the inability to exchange records between systems and the increasing requirements for information that must be documented turned this tool into a serious distraction from patient care verma also discussed the administration s patients over paperwork initiative which is intended to streamline ehr documentation and redesign the incentive system in mips to promot the interoperability of electronic medical records this means it would provide financial rewards for doctors who comply with guidelines meant to make communication across ehr systems more efficient in february 2019 verma laid out a plan for a digital data revolution that includes improving the interoperability or transferability of health data participation in the interoperability program will significantly affect physician compare scores while this initiative seems well intentioned it is misguided rather than simply reshuffling incentives yet again the federal government should recognize that the push to implement ehrs did not come from physicians or patients nor does it meaningfully solve problems in the lives of either widespread availability of health data may be valuable but only in a widespread sense for health research down the line as one physician joked he didn t go to medical school to become a sharecropper for the ehr industry growing and loading data for to sell the data is extremely valuable which is partly why different health providers and ehr vendors have been loath to share it further complicating the risks to patient safety meanwhile current patient care has been very clearly damaged by their implementation and doctors ought not be penalized for choosing not to use them in june 2019 cms issued a request for public input on how to reduce administrative burdens for doctors and improve patient care if the administration is serious about advocating for physicians and prioritizing patient well being it should simply remove the mips mandate on adopting meaningful use doctors who have already invested in these products may continue to use them but those who haven t should not be punished unlike the sgr macra has been in place for less than five years and repealing elements of the law will not overturn the industry the recently departed food and drug administration commissioner dr scott gottlieb has also weighed in on ehrs suggesting that government regulation of the systems may be helpful in coming years but rather than layer on fixes of this sort we should take a step back the thousands of problems associated with ehrs are immediate and obvious the problems they are intended to fix are vague one proponent of ehrs compared this transition period to that of the shift from horses to automobiles but there was no mass mandate to purchase cars physicians should not be required to use machines they don t find useful congress should also revoke or significantly revise the physician compare rating system as it is not based on a definition of excellence that most doctors are trained to pursue or that patients would ordinarily seek unlike consumer driven ratings sites it provides top down scores based on relatively arbitrary measures it emphasizes compliance with bureaucratic demands based on business interests that are questionable at best rather than on superior medical care following these requirements seems likely to further damage the already strained dynamic between patients and doctors another simple fix that would allow doctors greater leeway in the health market is lifting the price caps on physicians who do not participate in par as of now they are permitted to charge only 15 above medicare approved prices even though they opted out of receiving the benefits offered to physicians who willingly signed on to medicare s pricing system congress should also seek to reform the pricing system as a whole removing the built in rewards for family and rural doctors which in essence amount to a special tax for other physicians this is not to say that government initiatives supporting doctors in underserved areas are always a bad idea simply that they have no place in medicare the goal of which is to provide insurance for seniors and disabled individuals presidents kennedy and johnson passed laws with specific grant programs funding doctors in areas where they wished to improve medical accessibility a far more sensible approach we can and perhaps should channel funding where there is a clear need instead of punishing urban ophthalmologists via an enormous national fee schedule they have virtually no control over yet another way to bring doctors back into the conversation would be to lift onerous antitrust rules on the profession a series of legal challenges against physicians combined with clarifying regulations by the federal trade commission and the department of justice have placed doctors at a distinct disadvantage in negotiating prices with private insurers or the government ironically the supreme court case that had the largest impact in this area arizona v maricopa county medical society concerned physicians who had agreed to keep their prices below a certain amount they were not permitted to formalize this agreement insurance companies frequently merge and discuss prices with each other the government and other entities but they have largely been shielded from meaningful anti competitive action and they are now powerful enough to intrude on clinical decisions made by doctors for example they can refuse to cover a certain treatment or medicine and urge physicians to pursue an alternative that the doctor may not agree with they frequently issue mandates tied to physician or hospital reimbursement unilaterally revise contract terms and seek to direct physician behavior through provisions on medically necessary care yet doctors are virtually powerless to confer with one another regarding these policies health care executives have benefitted enormously from this structure as market and regulatory pressures favor the information technology and quality measures that have been imposed on physicians at great cost meanwhile physician incomes have stagnated or declined for decades this is made worse by the fact that doctors are legally responsible for all medical decisions they issue which places them in an impossible position when guidelines are pressed upon them by some other entity insurance companies are virtually never held legally responsible for the medical decisions they pressure doctors to make there is a simple solution to this as well revisit the stringent rules preventing physician consolidation and allow physicians to confer with one another regarding the prices and policies they negotiate with insurers this would provide doctors with valuable information on the health care market in general relieving them from both being entirely in the dark regarding pricing and being entirely at the mercy of insurance companies or the government it would also help to restore the place of doctors in conversations about what quality means in medicine health care begins with the relationship between a doctor and a patient yet doctors have been eclipsed and in some ways crushed by insurers ehr manufacturers and the federal government it is time to acknowledge their role in determining how to deliver medical care and to return autonomy to the medical profession
this article is more than 4 years old getty dear retail investors holding lame 0 75 bank certificates of deposits and u s treasury bonds yielding a tad over 2 for 10 years if you want your money to yield something outside of the stock market then it s time to leave the united states not pack your bags sell your home leave the united states but time to diversify out of u s bonds and cds and put that retirement money somewhere far far away it can t go to germany that s a negative yield debt it can t go to japan that s money under the mattress so it has to go to the emerging markets like china yes china we own china dollar bonds says james barrineau co head of emerging market debt at schroders in new york you get single a rated debt at generous spreads versus the rest of single a debt out there he says of the price differentials between china s investment grade bonds treasurys and other emerging market bonds of similar rating flows to emerging market bond funds embraced almost every group by duration and credit quality in the last week ending june 12 emerging market high yield bond funds recorded inflows for the 22nd time in the past 23 weeks at the country level china bond funds chalked up their biggest weekly inflow in over six years based on data provided by epfr global in cambridge mass much of the china flow is due to its government bonds being added recently to the bloomberg barclays global aggregate bond index the rest of the action has little do with china or any other emerging market for that matter right now it s all about the fed says barrineau drew angerer getty images on wednesday the fed voted by a margin of nine to one in favor of leaving interest rates unchanged st louis federal reserve chairman james bullard who the market would love see replace actual fed chairman jerome powell someday was the lone voice in favor of a rate cut the fed futures market is indicating a 100 certainty of a rate cut on july 31 in europe central banker mario draghi is indicating more quantitative easing you cannot be a saver anymore in the western world it s real estate stocks or foreign securities if you want some decent yield if the u s and europe continue cutting rates to zero making it impossible to hold a conservative investment portfolio of domestic fixed income securities in retirement then it is only a matter of time before emerging markets start creating products allowing for foreigners to invest in local bank cds or making it easier for retail investors to invest in their bond markets some mutual funds and exchange traded funds already make that possible though they are more volatile due to the underlying assets the bond prices themselves total return can take a hit on those funds even if the yield looks great from afar edmund harriss a

and new political risks unfolding in the u s and europe upending an established order everyone who sold emerging market bonds instead of buying them last year during the short lived dollar rally made a serious mistake says jan dehn head of research at the ashmore group an 85 billion asset management firm specializing in emerging markets emerging market bond lords have been waiting for the tipping point for years that tipping point is when retail invests start diversifying out of traditional american fixed income securities institutional investors have been doing it for years but are mostly underweight preferring domestic stocks and a stable local treasury market that has been supported almost entirely by the fed for 10 years emerging markets also have dollar bonds those bonds trade at around 340 basis points over treasuries versus 180 basis points pre great recession even a 340 basis points difference is stable a low spread of 180 basis points is so tight you might as well just stay home there are 73 countries in j p morgan s embi gd index today compared with 33 in 2008 with most of those bonds rated investment grade if you assume the big economic growth stories are most definitely outside of europe and in terms of percentage growth rates also outside of the u s then at the very least investment grade dollar denominated bonds in countries like china brazil and mexico have to look attractive to mom and pop investors as rates move closer to 1 5 getty assuming the fed is embarking on an interest rate cutting cycle then the rate normalization fears that had impacted those emerging market securities can go back into the closet a low fed rate is a much better outlook for emerging market dollar debt moreover by not putting the foot on the breaks a growing u s economy free from fed interference is beneficial to the rest of the world this is especially true in emerging markets where their central banks are cutting rates too people who are loading up on emerging market debt right now are going to be in a good position says vladimir signorelli founder of bretton woods research a big picture investment research firm out of long valley new jersey he picks two spots if brazil s central bank is going to cut i d be loading up on brazilian debt right now he says i m not a fan of turkey but lower rates in the u s make it a candidate for a risk taker fed cuts are only bullish for the credit market if the fed is perceived to be ahead of the curve says viktor hjort global head of credit strategy at bnp paribas that has only happened four times since 1980 he says but the prospects are good that this is the fifth why because they are starting early if the fed doesn t follow through however and cuts in july as wall street is basically demanding then there s probably going to be a bloodletting in the markets not just in the s p 500 but in everything

expand atomic taco wikimedia despite its flaws seattle s light rail system demonstrates a replicable strategy for u s cities seeking to expand both rail and affordable housing in equal measure twenty five hours is a long time with it you could file your taxes twice roast burn then re roast a brisket obtain and recover from a stomach virus or watch an entire nonstop month of the view olga sokal used to dread something far worse spending 25 hours on the bus every week in cities on both coasts as well as sun belt growth centers in between housing costs have skyrocketed in the urban core while affordable homes can often be found 30 or 40 miles outside downtown but antiquated or nonexistent rail service combined with congested highways make for unbearable commutes meanwhile underdeveloped bus lines make for arduous travel even closer in with soaring portland rents sokal moved to lake oswego just south of portland to take a job as an artist for animated films without money for a car portland s bus system was the only way for her to get to work she spent months commuting two and a half hours each way but even portland s transit was a step up from her former home in l a you can walk faster than an l a bus sokal tells me to a great degree gross extremes in housing prices and associated transportation troubles are a reflection of america s widening income and wealth gap as city centers become gentrified playgrounds for an ever more ostentatious class of elites a relatively fixed urban housing supply bids up prices yet the affordability crisis also reflects deeper policy failures on the twin fronts of housing and transportation part of the problem is inadequate funding for both another is neighborhood resistance to more construction of affordable housing the old nimby story still there are solutions to a housing crisis that will only grow more dire as cities grow denser and infrastructure ages one option is an increased commitment to public transportation coupled with the creation of affordable units close to transportation nodes often facilitated by deals with developers another is social housing protected in perpetuity from market price pressures and a third is investment in commuter rail ensuring that people with jobs in downtown centers can live in affordable outlying areas without commute times that significantly damage their quality of life each of these approaches brings its own political and policy challenges and none is currently on the fast track with that said there are some promising experiments worth visiting for sprawling west coast cities like l a the housing crisis is less about room to build and much more about political attitudes in california where a progressive governor enjoys a legislature with democratic supermajorities in both houses you might expect broad support for increasing affordable housing options one bill sb 827 proposed unprecedented statewide upzoning allowing developers to skirt restrictions for height and density limits in exchange for constructing housing within close proximity to public transportation routes and a quota of some affordable units the bill was first met with opposition from the usual suspects suburban residents bemoaning changes to neighborhood character and traffic congestion others supported sb 827 despite concerns about producing enough affordable units to meet california s need some took things one step further tenants rights organizations backed by local democratic socialists of america dsa activists argued that the language of sb 827 failed to ensure new developments would actually serve low income people more likely were thousands of displaced residents and a welcome mat for luxury apartments their proposed alternative explicit public housing state subsidies and a focus on public transportation in a rebuke to the nimby contingent they dubbed themselves phimby public housing in my backyard as strange bedfellows as could be the phimbys nonetheless found themselves aligned with the nimbys in opposing the upzoning bill ensuring no short supply of annoying acronymic perplexity a year after its first attempt a reworked bill pairing affordable housing with transportation made it through its first committee vote in 2019 but the opposition is fierce in cities like san francisco where a 9 2 board of supervisors vote opposed the bill this spring for now the language in sb 50 the latest resurrection of sb 827 still lacks clarity on regulating the specifics of developers pledge to guarantee the number of affordable units that would make it worthwhile as the economic geography scholars andrés rodríguez pose and michael storper detail in their recent study housing urban growth and inequalities these developer led deals are neither progressive nor grounded in socioeconomic reality theirs is a trickle down theory of affordable housing build more units slash regulations make developers rich while including modest amounts of affordable units to sweeten the deal only when compared to the flat out opposition of the nimbys does this model assume a progressive sheen whether private or public of course the idea of building affordable housing near transit nodes also requires the transit but like housing transit has not been forthcoming at adequate scale or reliability click here to read about how bus rapid transit can bridge the gap for cities struggling with transportation funding another strategy that is yet to live up to its promise is light rail in the era of ubiquitous streetcars documented by sam bass warner jr s great book streetcar suburbs dozens of trolley lines crisscrossed cities with housing developments springing up in their wake the result was that a large fraction of urban residents lived within walking distance of streetcars after most trolley lines were torn up in the auto era cities began to sprawl superimposing a few light rail lines onto a sprawled city doesn t begin to replicate the transportation density of yesteryear s trolleys yet many cities place their hopes on inadequate light rail while living under the unrelenting roar of seatac bound jetliners in seattle phil neel the author of hinterland and a ph d student in geography at the university of washington saw the interaction of limited transit and market oriented housing development firsthand even though light rail lines extended to his neighborhood the trek to get to them meant unreliable buses and long walks adding to an already grueling downtown commute you always hear this density argument but when i was living out by the airport in seattle density meant something entirely different than in downtown he told me you have massive immigrant populations with extended families and far greater numbers of residents per unit living on the outskirts of major cities in a way that isn t replicated by upper class urban professionals in other words poorer communities in outlying areas don t get the public transportation they need while richer residents with nominal public transit access are more likely to turn to cars for transportation for neel the problem is twofold first even relatively efficient public transportation isn t easily accessible to everyone in the area second creating more density can be deceiving a massive increase in single occupancy units inhabited by seattle s exponentially expanding tech class is not the same type of density found in communities like those surrounding sea tac more units does not necessarily make for more transportation efficient or socially equitable housing despite its flaws seattle has had far greater success than most cities when it comes to legislating policy that incentivizes development near public transportation while maintaining comparatively high percentages of low income housing the key to the city s success has been mandating affordable housing creation in the lots used for building out train stops which lie vacant after their construction is complete these lots are sold to developers at low cost but with high mandates on the number of below market units 80 percent that must be included in every development a massive 62 mile expansion of seattle s light rail is planned in the coming years with more than 30 new stations and a slew of available construction lots in tow with 54 billion allocated under st3 seattle s mass transit expansion bill affordable housing is sure to follow and while some say these efforts still don t go far enough pointing to the tens of thousands still struggling to locate affordable housing in seattle s red hot market at the very least the system demonstrates a replicable strategy for u s cities seeking to expand both rail and affordable housing in equal measure just a few miles west of boston in affluent newton the average house costs well over 1 million there is light rail access and swollen public coffers but similar obstacles to building affordable housing nonetheless newton is bisected by the green line a century old trolley that connects western suburbs to boston s downtown core creating affordable housing near this transit route would allow low income workers to access jobs in boston proper without having to pay the exorbitant costs that city living now incurs but newton s attempts to develop affordable housing have stalled illustrating the difficulty in both of the policy extremes debated in california create true public housing and watch cash slip between the cracks of ballooning development costs and nonstop contract wrangling or go with big private contractors and watch a megalith of luxury condos wipe out entire neighborhoods while providing a meager number of affordable units andreae downs a city councilor in newton says that when the city explored creating its own low income apartment development they found the estimated 4 9 million price tag for an eight unit project just didn t make sense especially with projected upkeep costs falling on the city s shoulders alone what s now on the table is a massive private development 800 residential units with 125 dedicated to low income applicants but even then says downs the development can hardly be described as transit oriented with a mile walk to the nearest green line stop it s really a chicken and egg scenario she tells me we want more affordable housing which means adding density near transit but to get that we really need a highly efficient transportation system and if we want that we need the density to convince the transportation authorities that it s worthwhile the real point is proof of concept how do we start some of these projects to get the ball rolling and stop the endless back and forth the greater payoff in the quest to connect transportation solutions to housing programs could well be in high speed commuter rail in metro areas like boston older outlying towns have lost population while maintaining housing stock and affordable rents the challenge is getting there while the quest for transit accessible and affordable housing in boston s inner suburbs like newton is an uphill battle commuter rail holds new promise if you build it they will come as things stand the existing massachusetts commuter rail functions but it s slow and unreliable trains snake their way toward boston shuttling in commuters from aging mill towns like lowell and haverhill in the north and growing exurbs like natick all the way to cities like worcester to the west viewed on a map the commuter rail spans an impressive breadth with close to 400 miles of line extending all the way into rhode island and covering much of the boston s north and south shore on the ground however massachusetts commuter rail leaves much to be desired according to many of the experts i spoke to the actual train schedules represent a model of transportation from a bygone era when 9 to 5 jobs meant that commuter rail could run just a few times a day while meeting the needs of most if not all of the standard workforce today it s not only blue collar and gig economy workers with late night and early morning schedules who find the 20th century model untenable from creative industry employees with day to day scheduling changes to parents juggling in flux child care needs to students priced out of the once affordable boston border towns of somerville and medford inconsistent service means that commuter rail is failing to meet the needs of its diverse ridership jim aloisi former secretary of transportation for massachusetts envisions a commuter rail transformed from hulking double decker diesel engines running on a postwar era schedule to a modern electrified track zipping commuters tourists and cash across the state he calls it regional rail and says without it the existing system will continue looking more and more like a relic from the past aloisi s re envisioning mirrors many of the projects and policies promoted by massinc a massachusetts based think tank that has framed transit oriented development as a panacea for economically depressed gateway cities spread across boston s periphery an effective regional rail could serve not only to bring workers to and from downtown boston but also to stimulate economies along the entire route the path forward is focused in part on expansion but more so on modernizing the existing system this would mean electrifying rail investing in high level platforms to expedite stop times and perhaps most importantly ensuring that trains run consistently throughout the day to serve a broad diversity of riders for former massachusetts governor michael dukakis the patron saint of public transportation advocates regional rail is a much better policy solution for the housing crisis than the type of blanket upzoning proposed in the past by the current republican administration of governor charlie baker i ve been riding trains in boston since i was five years old dukakis tells me and one thing i know for sure is that people prefer high quality transportation over high rise apartments that they can t afford following suit the extension of commuter rail into the south shore suburbs has finally secured funding and permitting governor baker with 1 billion in transit bonds has promised completion of the long anticipated extension in addition boston city councilors have shown enthusiastic support for an east west line connecting the towns of springfield and pittsfield to boston both extensions would serve to spread out the economic and population concentration in the coastal hub by stimulating commerce and transit to towns and cities that have seen their populations dwindle in the past decade despite its positioning to become a leader in the push for regional rail greater boston is far from the only metro area where modernized rail could link housing solutions to transportation from denver to houston to atlanta cities across the country are starting to consider regional rail as a solution for a multitude of economic and social ills california has not been as successful a high speed rail system slated to connect san francisco and l a has stalled with the words regional rail far from legislators lips instead lawmakers opted for a flashy and overpriced north to south bullet train which now seems as infeasible as it is impractical for solving california s deepening housing crisis adam tooze a historian at columbia university has written extensively about how productivity in the american construction industry has stagnated with devastating effect leading to the struggling state of transportation infrastructure we see today these flaws are compounded by conflicts of interest for tooze one of the most egregious examples of this phenomenon lies with california s failed attempt at high speed rail in a flagrant display of corporate capture jeff morales a former vp of the construction hegemon wsp formerly known as parsons brinckerhoff was named ceo of california s high speed rail project any guesses as to which firm won the bid for the project it was wsp california s high speed rail has been significantly rolled back since the firm won the bid and now even the small strip planned for the central valley is plagued with delays and overspending making it a sore spot for everyone involved this of course should come as no surprise as wsp s other mega project the big dig in boston ran 13 4 billion over budget is filled with leaks and fatal construction errors and is expected to need an immense and unanticipated overhaul to remain safe and functional the story of morales and wsp is no isolated incident it is a parable that symbolizes the failures of american transportation writ large where dozens of consultants construction firms and regulators spend an eternity blasting through tax dollars only to deliver supersized and inefficient projects compared to other countries u s spending per mile of rail when adjusted for purchasing power parity wages and scaling factors is three to four times higher this isn t a result of the cosmopolitan sensibilities of social democratic euro states nor the authoritarian hand of countries like china which seize land with little regard for those displaced in the process instead all dilapidated roads lead to a general lack of oversight and wildly inefficient project management alon levy a fellow at the d c policy center adds to this list of failures contracts being awarded based on cost alone instead of the formula used in countries such as spain which factor in construction speed and a technical score horrible project management levy points to the boston mbta green line extension which wasted 1 1 billion on a failed project overseen by a manager with no experience before starting over from scratch and finally perverse political incentives american politicians who are ambitious enough to embark on big infrastructure projects govern their respective states and cities like comets passing by quickly while expecting to move on to a bigger position within a few years they can build better institutions if they want but don t care to all this is to say that the problem is not just inadequate funding when the battle for transportation oriented development is reduced to the split between conservative hand wringing over deficit spending and liberal support for runaway project costs the real culprits of the gridlock slink away unchecked the fix is continuing to invest in crucial transportation initiatives while simultaneously working at the federal and state levels to streamline construction and planning so that the price tags associated with transit development could be reduced enough to generate bipartisan support despite this grim portrait of america s dueling crises of housing insecurity and failing public infrastructure there are a number of places starting to use both heavy and light rail to transform economically depressed communities into reservoirs of affordable housing stock and new economic growth in florida for example the coastal brightline now owned and operated by virgin under the name virgin trains usa runs from miami to west palm beach the rail is high speed and with planned expansions to orlando and tampa could become a structural model for future rapid transit expansion in california the billions of dollars poured into a high speed rail to nowhere could have been effectively used to replicate massachusetts s model of interconnected heavy rail threading through the inland empire and uniting sprawls from sacramento to san diego regional rail in california would help revitalize the impoverished hinterlands at the edges of city limits and provide housing for the millions of golden state workers being pushed to the breaking point by outrageous commutes the same can be said for any number of so called innovation hubs across the eastern seaboard teeming with tech dollars ripe for redirection into massive rail expansion from the florida panhandle to boston and new york to texas and the sprawls of the west coast people from all walks of life are desperate for housing that remains far out of reach and while there isn t any one silver bullet that can eliminate our country s massive wealth inequality and its radiating effects from nightmare commutes to affordable housing deserts to ever rising tides of gentrification and displacement investment in rail expansion and improvement is one of the few options that policymakers politicians and riders should all find appealing now the task is getting everyone on board

globalization is in trouble a populist backlash personified by u s president donald trump is in full swing a simmering trade war between china and the united states could easily boil over countries across europe are shutting their borders to immigrants even globalization s biggest boosters now concede that it has produced lopsided benefits and that something will have to change today s woes have their roots in the 1990s when policymakers set the world on its current hyperglobalist path requiring domestic economies to be put in the service of the world economy instead of the other way around in trade the transformation was signaled by the creation of the world trade organization in 1995 the wto not only made it harder for countries to shield themselves from international competition but also reached into policy areas that international trade rules had not previously touched agriculture services intellectual property industrial policy and health and sanitary regulations even more ambitious regional trade deals such as the north american free trade agreement took off around the same time in finance the change was marked by a fundamental shift in governments attitudes away from managing capital flows and toward liberalization pushed by the united states and global organizations such as the international monetary fund and the organization for economic cooperation and development countries freed up vast quantities of short term finance to slosh across borders in search of higher returns at the time these changes seemed to be based on sound economics openness to trade would lead economies to allocate their resources to where they would be the most productive capital would flow from the countries where it was plentiful to the countries where it was needed more trade and freer finance would unleash private investment and fuel global economic growth but these new arrangements came with risks that the hyperglobalists did not foresee although economic theory could have predicted the downside to globalization just as well as it did the upside increased trade with china and other low wage countries accelerated the decline in manufacturing employment in the developed world leaving many distressed communities behind the financialization of the global economy produced the worst financial crisis since the great depression and after the crash international institutions promoted policies of austerity that made the damage even worse more and more of what happened to ordinary people seemed the result of anonymous market forces or caused by distant decision makers in foreign countries politicians and policymakers downplayed these problems denying that the new terms of the global economy entailed sacrificing sovereignty yet they seemed immobilized by these same forces the center right and the center left disagreed not over the rules of the new world economy but over how they should accommodate their national economies to them the right wanted to cut taxes and slash regulations the left asked for more spending on education and public infrastructure both sides agreed that economies needed to be refashioned in the name of global competitiveness globalization exclaimed u s president bill clinton is the economic equivalent of a force of nature like wind or water british prime minister tony blair mocked those who wanted to debate globalization saying you might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer yet there was nothing inevitable about the path the world followed beginning in the 1990s international institutions played their part but hyperglobalization was more a state of mind than a genuine immutable constraint on domestic policy before it came along countries had experimented with two very different models of globalization the gold standard and the bretton woods system the new hyperglobalization was closer in spirit to the historically more distant and more intrusive gold standard that is the source of many of today s problems it is to the more flexible principles of bretton woods that today s policymakers should look if they are to craft a fairer and more sustainable global economy the golden straitjacket for roughly 50 years before world war i plus a brief revival during the interwar period the gold standard set the rules of economic management a government on the gold standard had to fix the value of its national currency to the price of gold maintain open borders to finance and repay its external debts under all circumstances if those rules meant the government had to impose what economists would today call austerity so be it however great the damage to domestic incomes and employment that willingness to impose economic pain meant it was no coincidence that the first self consciously populist movement arose under the gold standard at the tail end of the nineteenth century the people s party gave voice to distressed american farmers who were suffering from high interest rates on their debt and declining prices for their crops the solution was clear easier credit enabled by making the currency redeemable in silver as well as gold if the government allowed anyone with silver bullion to convert it into currency at a set rate the supply of money would increase driving up prices and easing the burden of the farmers debts but the northeastern establishment and its backing for the gold standard stood in the way frustrations grew and at the 1896 democratic national convention william jennings bryan a candidate for the presidential nomination famously declared you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold william jennings bryan campaigning in 1896 library of congress the gold standard survived the populist assault in the united states thanks in part to fortuitous discoveries of gold ore that eased credit conditions after the 1890s nearly four decades later the gold standard would be brought down for good this time by the united kingdom under the pressure of similar grievances after effectively suspending the gold standard during world war i the united kingdom returned to it in 1925 at its pre war rate but the british economy was only a shadow of its pre war self and four years later the crash of 1929 pushed the country over the edge business and labor demanded lower interest rates which under the gold standard would have sent capital fleeing abroad this time however the british government chose the domestic economy over the global rules and abandoned the gold standard in 1931 two years later franklin roosevelt the newly elected u s president wisely followed suit as economists now know the sooner a country left the gold standard the sooner it came out of the great depression the experience of the gold standard taught the architects of the postwar international economic system chief among them the economist john maynard keynes that keeping domestic economies on a tight leash to promote international trade and investment made the system more not less fragile accordingly the international regime that the allied countries crafted at the bretton woods conference in 1944 gave governments plenty of room to set monetary and fiscal policy central to this system were the controls it put on international capital mobility as keynes emphasized capital controls were not merely a temporary expedient until financial markets stabilized after the war they were a permanent arrangement each government fixed the value of its currency but it could adjust that value when the economy ran up against the constraint of international finance the bretton woods system was predicated on the belief that the best way to encourage international trade and long term investment was to enable national governments to manage their economies it is to the more flexible principles of bretton woods that today s policymakers should look if they are to craft a fairer and more sustainable global economy bretton woods covered only international monetary and financial arrangements rules for trade developed in a more ad hoc manner under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt but the same philosophy applied countries were to open up their economies only to the extent that this did not upset domestic social and political bargains trade liberalization remained limited to lowering border restrictions import quotas and tariffs on manufactured goods and applied only to developed countries developing countries were essentially free to do what they wanted and even developed countries had plenty of flexibility to protect sensitive sectors when in the early 1970s a rapid rise in garment imports from developing countries threatened employment in the developed world developed and developing nations negotiated a special regime that allowed the former to reimpose import quotas compared with both the gold standard and the subsequent hyper globalization the bretton woods and gatt rules gave countries great freedom to choose the terms on which they would participate in the world economy advanced economies used that freedom to regulate and tax their economies as they wished and to build generous welfare states unhindered by worries of global competitiveness or capital flight developing nations diversified their economies through trade restrictions and industrial policies domestic autonomy from global economic pressures might sound like a recipe for less globalization but during the bretton woods era the global economy was on a tear developed and developing economies alike grew at unprecedented rates trade and foreign direct investment expanded even faster outpacing the growth of world gdp the share of exports in global output more than tripled from less than five percent in 1945 to 16 percent in 1981 this success was a remarkable validation of keynes idea that the global economy functions best when each government takes care of its own economy and society back to the spirit of the gold standard ironically the hyperglobalists used the very success of the bretton woods system to legitimize their own project to displace it if the shallow bretton woods arrangements had done so much to lift world trade investment and living standards they argued imagine what deeper integration could achieve but in the process of constructing the new regime the central lesson of the old one was forgotten globalization became the end national economies the means economists and policymakers came to view every conceivable feature of domestic economies through the lens of global markets domestic regulations were either hidden trade barriers to be negotiated away through trade agreements or potential sources of trade competitiveness the confidence of financial markets became the paramount measure of the success or failure of monetary and fiscal policy the premise of the bretton woods regime had been that the gatt and other international agreements would act as a counterweight to powerful protectionists at home labor unions and firms serving mainly the domestic market by the 1990s however the balance of political power in rich countries had swung away from the protectionists toward exporter and investor lobbies the trade deals that emerged in the 1990s reflected the strength of those lobbies the clearest illustration of that power came when international trade agreements incorporated domestic protections for intellectual property rights the result of aggressive lobbying by pharmaceutical firms eager to capture profits by extending their monopoly power to foreign markets to this day big pharma is the single largest lobby behind trade deals international investors also won special privileges in trade agreements allowing them and only them to directly sue governments in international tribunals for alleged violations of their property rights big banks with the power of the u s treasury behind them pushed countries to open up to international finance those who lost out from hyper globalization received little support many manufacturing dependent communities in the united states saw their jobs shipped off to china and mexico and suffered serious economic and social consequences ranging from joblessness to epidemics of drug addiction in principle workers hurt by trade should have been compensated through the federal trade adjustment assistance program but politicians had no incentives to fund it adequately or to make sure it was working well economists were brimming with confidence in the 1990s about globalization as an engine of growth the game was to encourage exports and attract foreign investment do that and the gains would prove so large that everyone would eventually win this technocratic consensus served to legitimize and further reinforce the power of globalizing corporate and financial special interests an important element of hyper globalist triumphalism was the belief that countries with different economic and social models would ultimately converge if not on identical models at least on sufficiently similar market economy models china s admission to the wto in particular was predicated on the expectation in the west that the state would give up directing economic activity the chinese government however had different ideas it saw little reason to move away from the kind of managed economy that had produced such miraculous results over the previous 40 years western investors complaints that china was violating its wto commitments and engaging in unfair economic practices fell on deaf ears regardless of the legal merits of each side s case the deeper problem lay elsewhere the new trade regime could not accommodate the full range of institutional diversity among the world s largest economies a saner globalization policymakers can no longer resuscitate the bretton woods system in all its details the world can t and shouldn t go back to fixed exchange rates pervasive capital controls and high levels of trade protection but policymakers can draw on its lessons to craft a new healthier globalization trump s in your face unilateralism is the wrong way forward politicians should work to revive the multilateral trade regime s legitimacy rather than squelching it the way to achieve that however is not to further open markets and tighten global rules on trade and investment barriers to trade in goods and many services are already quite low the task is to ensure greater popular support for a world economy that is open in essential respects even if it falls short of the hyperglobalist ideal if china and the united states are to resolve their trade conflict they need to acknowledge that the differences between their economies are not going away building that support will require new international norms that expand the space for governments to pursue domestic objectives for rich countries this will mean a system that allows them to reconstitute their domestic social contracts the set of rules that permit countries to temporarily protect sensitive sectors from competition badly needs reform for example the wto allows countries to impose temporary tariffs known as antidumping duties on imports being sold by a foreign company below cost that threaten to harm a domestic industry the wto should also let governments respond to so called social dumping the practice of countries violating workers rights in order to keep wages low and attract production an anti social dumping regime would permit countries to protect not merely industry profits but labor standards too for developing countries the international rules should accommodate governments need to restructure their economies to accelerate growth the wto should also loosen the rules on subsidies investment and intellectual property rights that constrain developing countries ability to boost particular industries if china and the united states are to resolve their trade conflict they need to acknowledge that the differences between their economies are not going away the chinese economic miracle was built on industrial and financial policies that violated key tenets of the new hyperglobalist regime subsidies for preferred industries requirements that foreign companies transfer technology to domestic firms if they wanted to operate in china pervasive state ownership and currency controls the chinese government is not going to abandon such policies now what u s companies see as the theft of intellectual property is a time honored practice in which a young united states itself engaged back when it was playing catch up with industrializing england in the nineteenth century for its part china must realize that the united states and european countries have legitimate reasons to protect their social contracts and homegrown technologies from chinese practices taking a page from the u s soviet relationship during the cold war china and the united states should aim for peaceful coexistence rather than convergence in international finance countries should reinstate the norm that domestic governments get to control the cross border mobility of capital especially of the short term kind the rules should prioritize the integrity of domestic macroeconomic policies tax systems and financial regulations over free capital flows the international monetary fund has already reversed its categorical opposition to capital controls but governments and international institutions should do more to legitimize their use for example governments can make their domestic economies more stable by using countercyclical capital regulation that is restricting capital inflows when the economy is running hot and taxing outflows during a downturn governments should also crack down on tax evasion by the wealthy by establishing a global financial registry that would record the residence and nationality of shareholders and the actual owners of financial assets left to its own devices globalization always creates winners and losers a key principle for a new globalization should be that changes in its rules must produce benefits for all rather than the few economic theory contributes an important idea here it suggests that the scope for compensating the losers is much greater when the barrier being reduced is high to begin with from this perspective whittling away at the remaining mostly minor restrictions on trade in goods or financial assets does not make much sense countries should focus instead on freeing up cross border labor mobility where the barriers are far greater indeed labor markets are the area that offers the strongest economic case for deepening globalization expanding temporary work visa programs especially for low skilled workers in advanced economies would be one way to go proposing greater globalization of labor markets might seem to fly in the face of the usual concern that increased competition from foreign workers will harm low skilled workers in advanced economies and it may well be a political nonstarter in the united states and western europe right now if governments aren t proposing to compensate those who lose out they should take this concern seriously but the potential economic gains are huge even a small increase in cross border labor mobility would produce global economic gains that would dwarf those from the completion of the entire current long stalled round of multilateral trade negotiations that means there s plenty of scope for compensating the losers for example by taxing increased cross border labor flows and spending the proceeds directly on labor market assistance programs in general global governance should be light and flexible allowing governments to choose their own methods of regulation countries trade not to confer benefits on others but because trade creates gains at home when those gains are distributed fairly throughout the domestic economy countries don t need external rules to enforce openness they ll choose it of their own accord a lighter touch may even help globalization after all trade expanded faster relative to global output during the three and a half decades of the bretton woods regime than it has since 1990 even excluding the slowdown following the 2008 global financial crisis countries should pursue international agreements to constrain domestic policy only when they re needed to tackle genuine beggar thy neighbor problems such as corporate tax havens economic cartels and policies that keep one s currency artificially cheap the current system of international rules tries to rein in many economic policies that don t represent true beggar thy neighbor problems consider bans on genetically modified organisms agricultural subsidies industrial policies and overly lax financial regulation each of these policies could well harm other countries but the domestic economy in question will pay the bulk of the economic cost governments adopt such policies presumably because they think the social and political benefits are worth the price tag in any individual case a government might well be wrong but international institutions aren t likely to be better judges of the tradeoffs and even when they re right their decisions will lack democratic legitimacy the push into hyperglobalization since the 1990s has led to much greater levels of international economic integration at the same time it has produced domestic disintegration as professional corporate and financial elites have connected with their peers all over the globe they have grown more distant from their compatriots at home today s populist backlash is a symptom of that fragmentation the bulk of the work needed to mend domestic economic and political systems has to be done at home closing the economic and social gaps widened by hyperglobalization will require restoring primacy to the domestic sphere in the policy hierarchy and demoting the international the greatest contribution the world economy can make to this project is to enable rather than encumber that correction
trump predicted a very good chance of working out a trade agreement and that some lower level discussions would begin wednesday i think china wants to make a deal they do not like the tariffs a lot of companies are leaving china in order to avoid the tariffs trump said to reporters mixed tone out of china ahead of trade talks while welcoming talks between the u s and china statements and newspaper editorials from the country are making clear that from their perspective coming discussions on trade between the u s and china need to be approached in a certain way the heads of the two trade teams will communicate according to instructions passed down from the two presidents gao feng chinese commerce ministry spokesman told reporters we hope the united states will create the necessary conditions and atmosphere for solving problems through dialogue as equals he stated that there are three keys to the coming talks the removal of additional tariffs trade purchases and a balanced text for the deal gao labeled those as matters of principle that cannot be compromised china s principles and basic stance on sino u s economic and trade consultations have always been clear and consistent and china s core concerns must be properly resolved he stated the china daily newspaper stated in an editorial it appeared both sides were ready for serious dialogue and that one meeting was not going to result in a resolution noting that it would be expecting too much to anticipate one single meeting will wrap everything up the two parties expectations are too divergent to allow that the paper said more likely than not the one on one meeting will end up being the start of a new phase in the negotiations with the two leaders personally setting out their country s respective bottom lines the global times struck a more contentious tone saying the country can never be daunted washington insider anti us currency war questioned the federal reserve meeting this week has come and gone and it says that it is thinking about the need for lower interest rates but no change was announced yet in the meantime president trump complained to the press that the u s was the target of a currency war bloomberg says maybe not the report notes that it is usually not hard to tell when a war has started when nation s move soldiers tanks and planes currency wars are tougher to call partly because there isn t even a clear definition of what they are bloomberg says that should be kept in mind when evaluating president trump s accusations against central banks in europe and asia he tweeted june 18 that mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others the president is right on two scores bloomberg says the euro really did decline against the dollar to 1 12 from 1 16 a year ago after draghi the outgoing president of the european central bank said additional stimulus will be required if the economic outlook for the 19 country euro zone doesn t improve trump is also correct that a cheaper currency would likely boost the region s economy by making exports from the euro zone cheaper abroad and by making imports from the u s and elsewhere more expensive but bloomberg disagrees with the president and notes that many economists also disagree with trump that draghi is doing something wrong it would be legitimate for the ecb to cut interest rates they argue to stimulate domestic economic growth by lowering borrowing costs for consumers and businesses of course cutting rates would likely reduce the value of the euro which adds to the stimulus but that s a side effect not the goal we don t target the exchange rate draghi said during a june 18 panel discussion in sintra portugal let s say the depreciation of the euro managed to worsen the u s trade deficit enough to slow down the american economy the federal reserve could respond by cutting interest rates to rev growth that would incidentally lower the value of the dollar returning it to its previous exchange rate with the euro but as in the case of the euro a weaker greenback would be a side effect of the lower rates not a primary goal it might look like a zero sum stalemate when two trading partners both cut interest rates leaving the exchange rate where it started but it s not it s an overall loosening of monetary policy which is good for growth in both countries says brad setser a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations in principle he says that s just a coordinated easing that increases the level of demand trump s argument that china is manipulating its currency is even weaker than his case against europe bloomberg says far from pushing down the value of the yuan the people s bank of china has been countering market forces to slow its decline china has kept the benchmark one year lending rate at 4 35 where it s been since october 2015 in spite of economic softness that might seem to justify a cut also china s holdings of foreign reserves haven t risen appreciably as they would if china were trying to drive down the yuan by selling it and buying other currencies the available evidence suggests that china is trying to avoid a currency war setser says chinese leaders don t want a weaker currency even if it gives a short run economic boost says marc chandler chief market strategist at bannockburn global forex llc in new york the country s long run objectives are to move up the value added chain and encourage the chinese to work smarter not harder chandler wrote in a june 18 note to clients competing on price through a cheap yuan would keep china stuck in its low tech past how would anyone know if a country really were playing unfair by depreciating its currency one telltale sign is the central bank buying lots of foreign currency to reduce its own currency s value even though the country has a big surplus in trade and investment income with the rest of the world china was guilty of that behavior up until early 2014 singapore south korea and thailand have also intervened at various times in recent years to suppress their currencies value today one of the chief currency offenders is taiwan setser wrote in a june 18 research note the taiwanese central bank says it had 464 billion in foreign exchange at the end of may that s more than the holdings of bigger nations such as brazil germany and india according to a description on the central bank s website the value of the taiwan dollar is determined by forces of supply and demand though when the market is disrupted by seasonal or irregular factors the bank will step in so even if the evidence is thin u s officials have often charged trading partners with unfair policies in addition the administration s reliance on escalating tariffs in its get tough trade policy negotiations has increasingly come in
