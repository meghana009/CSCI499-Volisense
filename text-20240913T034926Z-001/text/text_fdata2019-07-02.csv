news national by staff reporter the decision by government this week to abolish the multi currency regime and re introduce the zimbabwean dollar as the sole legal tender could be catastrophic as the local currency s value may tumble against major currencies plunging the country into hyperinflation while some captains of industry and analysts welcomed the move others were sceptical and critical the zimdollar which was initially abandoned in 2009 after being ravaged by severe hyperinflation this week became the country s sole currency through statutory instrument si 142 of 2019 known as the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz legal tender regulations in 2016 government introduced the bond currency to the basket of currencies a fiat currency which was ostensibly meant to incentivise exporting firms these regulations may be cited as the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz legal tender regulations 2019 subject to section 3 with effect from 24th june 2019 the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe part of the si said accordingly the zimbabwean dollar shall with effect from the 24 june 2019 but subject to section 3 be the sole legal tender in zimbabwe in all transactions the rationale to abandon the multi currency system which brought relative stability on the market when it was introduced in 2009 as explained by finance minister mthuli ncube this week is to restore the central bank s monetary authority thereby containing spiralling commodity prices and inflation what we are trying to do is restore full monetary policy where the central bank can conduct monetary policy using the array of tools that are necessary for managing monetary policy such as interest rates use of a monetary policy committee to govern things like targeting money balances or even targeting inflation ncube said basically the multi currency regime which had by the way become a mono currency in favour of the us dollar was favouring those with access to us dollars those with access to us dollars were facing no change in inflation at all for the last three years however the basis for adopting a basket of currencies a decade ago was supported by the need to stabilise zimbabwe s fragile economy in the absence of macro economic fundamentals which resulted in the decimation of the local dollar amid spiralling inflation which peaked to 89 7 sextillion percent on november 14 2008 now a decade later zimbabwe still deep in the throes of an intractable economic crisis is reeling from unstable macro economic fundamentals not conducive for the return of the local dollar the local unit a combination of electronic balances bond coins and notes already in circulation has failed to hold its own against major currencies particularly the ever firming united states dollar official figures show that inflation has risen to 97 8 though renowned us economist steve hanke forecasts it to be hovering at more than 300 ironically treasury projects inflation to recede below 14 by year end tamed as it says by the range of austerity measures currently being implemented with zimbabwe s agriculture sector which used to be the mainstay of the economy ruined by former president robert mugabe s chaotic land reform programme of 2000 experts say the southern african country s decision to abandon the multi currency system while upholding the local dollar as the sole legal tender could lead to an all too familiar path of hyperinflation ditching the basket of currencies analysts say will exert inflationary pressures on the local currency unless backed by foreign currency gold reserves and exports in february government liberalised the exchange rate resulting in the rtgs dollar tumbling in value against the us dollar and other currencies it is now pegged at 6 3 to the us dollar on the interbank market while on the parallel market it has soared to 13 critics of the return of the zimbabwean dollar which is now the monetary unit effectively in circulation say that it is imperative to ensure macro economic stability and restore public confidence before the country can start trading with its local currency they say the real value of a currency lies in the public confidence besides its intrinsic and market value but with memories of zimbabwe s hyperinflation era still fresh in their memories confidence appears to have waned as the local unit continues to tumble against currencies of choice necessitating government intervention coupled with that zimbabwe is also struggling to extinguish an estimated us 20 billion debt stock a situation which has restricted the country from unlocking fresh lines of credit perceived to be key towards mending the sbattered economy bindura university commerce lecturer felix chari said in the absence of structural economic reforms treasury s decision to abandon the multi currency regime would stoke inflationary pressures and render the local unit worthless it was premature to reintroduce the local currency in the absence of sound macro economic fundamentals required to stabilise the economy the zimbabwean dollar is vulnerable to inflation due to low levels of productivity and exports inflation will continue to rise as the zimbabwean dollar devalues chari contends former finance minister tendai biti who served in the inclusive government that saw zimbabwe adopting dollarisation as an official currency policy said the scrapping of the multi currency regime would spark civil unrest with retail shops running dry and the local unit depreciating it is insanity it is total madness you cannot introduce a new currency when the macro economic fundamentals are not there we have a crisis of confidence a crisis of legitimacy biti said you are going to see a massive shortage of goods in the supermarkets you are going to see disinvestment in the country there will be massive externalisation you will see massive civil unrest it is a major security threat however other analysts say the zimdollar s return was necessary even in these conditions

overview the euphoria that greeted the resumption of us china and us north korea talks has subsided global equities have turned mixed after yesterday s surge hong kong played catch up and despite ongoing demonstrations the hang seng rallied over one percent and the hong kong dollar strengthened beyond its band midpoint for the first time in nine months europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is consolidating near three month highs and us shares are trading with a heavier bias the s p 500 gapped higher yesterday and that gap 2944 2951 2 is important from a technical perspective meanwhile the debt market rally continues led by ideas that italy will avoid excessive debt proceeding italy s 10 year yields are off almost 10 bp after falling below 2 yesterday new record low yields are being posted throughout the core and periphery the italian two year yield briefly dipped below zero for the first time the dollar is mostly softer though sterling continues to underperform the reserve bank of australia delivered the widely expected rate cut and the aussie is leading today s move against the dollar 0 2 after yesterday s slide asia pacific china has brought forward another measure that opens its financial sectors it will lift the ownership limit for companies in financial services this is one of the areas that foreign investors especially in the us had been strongly advocating south korea reported a 0 2 decline n headline cpi in june which was the first decline since january the year over year remained unchanged at 0 7 the central bank meets july 17 pressure is building to reverse last november s rate hike but this month s meeting is seen a bit early the reserve bank of australia cut the cash rate by 25 bp to 1 25 the accompanying statement kept the door open to additional easing another cut as early as august has largely 80 been discounted and there is a strong leaning to yet another cut before the end of the year of course the timing will depend on the growth employment and price developments but the idea that more accommodation will be delivered going forward is deeply ingrained the aussie posted a key reversal yesterday by trading at new highs for the move and then reversing lower to close below the pre weekend low after the cut announcement which initially knocked it back it returned to test the 0 6990 area the intraday technical readings suggest it may struggle to resurface above 0 7000 the dollar gapped higher yesterday against the yen and that gap appears to be attracting prices today the gap is found between last friday s high jpy107 95 and monday s low jpy108 05 there is an option for 400 mln at jpy108 10 that expires today and a 1 9 bln option at jpy108 00 that expires tomorrow on the upside is a roughly 420 mln option at jpy108 50 that will be cut today there is another one billion option struck there that expires tomorrow the dollar rose against the chinese yuan for the first time in four sessions the 0 4 gain is the most since mid may yesterday the dollar reached almost cny6 8350 and today it briefly traded above cny6 88 before closing just below europe italy has taken europe by storm some last minute projections for less spending and higher revenue is allowing the government to forecast a smaller deficit 2 04 rather than 2 40 and improvement in the structural deficit of 0 3 rather than a 0 2 deterioration nearly half the projected savings comes from clawing back funds from social programs that have a low take up according to reports the new projections will make it easier for the ec to do what it wanted and that is to avoid a confrontation now this seems to simply delay the conflict to after the summer when the 2020 budget comes into focus the eu projects a structural deficit more than twice as high as italy the impressive rally in italian bonds which has knocked 20 bp off the 10 year yield since the weekend has done little for italian bank shares an index of italian bank shares fell nearly 1 yesterday and are duplicating that today germany reported a disappointing 0 6 decline in may retail sales the bloomberg survey found a median forecast of a 0 5 increase the disappointment may have been mitigated by the fact that april s 2 decline was revised to only a 1 loss iran announced yesterday that it breached the limit for low enriched uranium it is understood to be a small breach and is seen as a demand that others especially europe and russia provide more economic help in effect and at the risk of over simplifying the treaty ostensibly traded economic aid for a curb on iranian nuclear development the us unilateral withdrawal and embargo is choking the country while europe insists it adheres to the agreement the payments workaround it currently limited to trade for food and medicine which is allowable under the us embargo though dollar transactions are prohibited the euro initially extended yesterday s sharp loss falling to 1 1275 but holding just above the 61 8 retracement of the rally that began on june 18 initial resistance is seen near 1 1320 the 1 13 area may prove sticky with around a 650 mln euro option struck there that expires today tomorrow 3 4 bln euros in options between 1 1290 and 1 1300 expire and then on july 4 another option for 1 2 bln euros at 1 1290 expires sterling appeared to have built a shelf last week near 1 2660 but pushed through it yesterday and follow through selling today saw it approach 1 26 the intraday technical indicators are stretched and the old support 1 2660 should now act as resistance america with us china trade talks resuming we anticipated that the trump administration would turn its attention to europe and japan it wasted no time the us added 4 bln of goods that it will add to the 21 bln of products published in april that will be used to retaliate against europe for illegal subsidies for airbus another round of public hearings will be held in early august with an eye toward adding another 4 bln of goods to the list what differentiates this action from the steel and aluminum tariffs or the threatened auto tariffs is that the us went through wto processes the us action waits for the wto decision on the appropriate level of response that decision is expected in the coming weeks meanwhile the eu has a case against us subsidies for boeing that is making its way through the wto processes the us reports june auto sales a 17 0 mln unit pace is expected retail sales of vehicles in h1 appear to be on track from their weakest showing in six years fleet sales helped cushion the blow auto sales are cyclical and the 12 month moving average peaked in the first half of 2016 near 17 4 mln units output appears to be slowing and high inventories will need to be worked off the us dollar tested and held the pre weekend low against the canadian dollar yesterday cad1 3060 and recovered to close above cad1 31 today it has remained above cad1 31 but has not been able to move above yesterday s high cad1 3145 consolidation is likely today the dollar is also consolidating against the mexican peso it practically transversed the mxn19 00 mxn19 20 range yesterday and is straddling the middle of it today trump has praised mexico for getting control of its borders and has rescinded the tariff threat the dollar index narrowly extended yesterday s advance but is reversing lower in the european morning support is seen in the 96 45 96 55 band it may take a break of the 96 20 area to boost confidence a high is in place
editor s note our 2019 doing business magazine is out get a pdf version online or pick up a copy in kyiv recruited by then finance minister natalie jaresko to join her in 2015 and do something good for your country oksana markarova remains leading the ministry that jaresko left in 2016 and oleksandr danylyuk in 2018 jaresko and danylyuk were forced out as finance ministers amid political disputes that started erupting two years after the euromaidan revolution that ousted president viktor yanukovych in 2014 markarova a technocratic public finance expert with a background in private equity has thus far managed to navigate those disputes i stayed longer than i thought i would the 42 year old married mother of four children told the kyiv post in a wide ranging interview in her office on a saturday morning in june she s willing to stay on even longer but she has her conditions i believe in a european and nato future for ukraine i believe in a market economy and fiscal consolidation she said if the direction is any different it s not something i can support or be a part of she s prudently preparing for her possible exit which could come within weeks of a july 21 snap parliamentary election that is expected to be won by president volodymyr zelensky s servant of the people party the new ruling coalition will then form a new government by september that may or may not include markarova in her current role right now we in the ministry think we re at the finish line of this political cycle she said before she leaves markarova has things she wants to accomplish including leaving the next government with a fiscally sound 2020 state budget that will spend less than 50 billion about the size of the budget of the u s state of maryland next year here are her top four priorities macroeconomic stability ukraine s debt service is enormous at hr 418 billion to external and internal creditors it s more than 15 billion and nearly a third of the state budget in an economy that may officially have only 120 billion in economic output in 2019 amid these fiscal landmines markarova has to craft budgets that will repay the debt and continue to meet the nation s enormous social obligations to people including 12 percent of gross domestic product to pensions regardless of all the political processes the country should work without interruptions she said it s clear what we need to do to get debt under control and get the country on its feet and continue to grow 3 year budget plans she admits the passion she has for longer term budget planning sounds technical and boring to the average person but defended it as essential to ensuring the financing of reforms while meeting current obligations during transition periods she also wants the next government not to have to worry about next year s budget right away the new government will not have a lot of time she said sept 15 is the date when the cabinet has to submit the budget to the parliament keep international lenders she favors borrowing from official lenders such as the international monetary fund world bank and european union because the loans come for longer terms and cheaper interest rates than on the private market of course the loans have strings attached they re tied with reforms but it s a plus not a minus she said that default on ukraine s nearly 80 billion in public debt is out of the question already she said the nation is making progress in reducing the debt burden the statistics back her up the ratio of ukraine s total state debt to gdp will decrease to 62 percent by the end of 2019 according to the imf s world economic outlook while markarova wants to cut it to 43 percent by 2022 moreover private investors are responding well to the relative macroeconomic stability in place which also includes receding inflation to single digits and adequate hard currency reserves ukraine on june 13 issued 1 billion euros worth of eurobonds at a favorable annual interest rate of 6 75 percent with a seven year maturity rate timothy ash a london based analyst who knows ukraine well said that the eurobond sale was very impressive and shows what the nation can do with a proper debt management strategy ash said that markarova comes across very well with investors she is direct efficient no messing around another fan is swedish economist anders aslund a fellow at the atlantic council who told the kyiv post she enjoys great respect both within the government and in the international community she sticks to her fiscal goals she behaves like a civil servant rather than a politician state fiscal service reform eliminating corruption and inefficiency in the state fiscal service the nation s gargantuan tax and customs service has bedeviled many politicians lawmakers and finance ministers the temptation for personal enrichment through graft smuggling and kickbacks is huge two former heads of the state tax service roman nasirov and myroslav prodan have been implicated in criminal financial wrongdoing accusations both have denied an attempt to separate customs from the tax service as part of a broader restructuring has been blocked in court the truth is on our side said markarova who hopes an appellate court will overturn the ruling of the lower court judges the split of tax and customs into two parts is not the focus or the end of the reform or the reform in and of itself she said but the split would make changes easier to accomplish while the split is stalled markarova said much can be done in making the tax service less repressive and more customer friendly and digital among the changes she said are reprioritizing tax police investigators to crack down on major money laundering cases and excise tax evasion in cigarettes and alcohol the tax police used to spawn numerous business complaints for arbitrary and heavy handed inspections of law abiding businesses seemingly designed to extort bribes one major reform the overhaul of the system for issuing value added tax refunds took place two years ago shutting off a big avenue for corruption now the process is transparent predictable and markarova said irreversible unlike in the yanukovych era when businesses complained that tax service agents demanded 20 percent kickbacks to receive refunds another bright spot in the state fiscal service markarova said that she has strong faith in the new head of the tax service sergei verlanov a former deputy finance minister he has a very good track record in business and a very good reputation after his work with the public integrity council involved in the selection of new judges she said he s very honest and very capable and a very good tax lawyer stalled investigations but another promising change the creation of a special unit to investigate financial crimes remains stalled it would need a law by parliament to get started there is no consensus however on whether the unit should just investigate tax violations and stay under the finance ministry or investigate all financial crimes taking away these powers from all other law enforcement agencies we have been discussing way too long markarova said we don t have a consensus at the moment unfortunately in the meantime huge financial crimes like bank fraud that cost taxpayers at least 20 billion this decade alone go unpunished courts rule of law just as ukraine s courts dealt a blow to state fiscal service reforms judges have also put up obstacles to the privatization of the largest state owned enterprises part of a portfolio of more than 1 800 government owned businesses that are sources of corruption and a fiscal drag the record is very bad in large privatization markarova said in 2018 we had reason for optimism after three years of fighting we managed to adopt the law that is much better than what we have now we selected professional advisers to prepare properties to attract real buyers what did the vested interests do they started stopping it through the courts every time we do something good we come back to the need for full fledged judicial reform what needs to be done ukraine would not have to borrow so much money or any money at all if it could get more people to voluntarily pay taxes raise money through privatization of state enterprises end corruption in the tax and customs services start imposing real property taxes nationwide to benefit local governments end monopolies in many sectors create an agricultural land market sell off more foreclosed assets from banks raise excise taxes even higher on cigarettes and alcohol stem the flow of offshore tax evasion and transfer pricing abuses and more ukraine is making progress in all of these areas but vested interests in the status quo skillfully block radical changes in the nation s largely unreformed distrusted and corrupt courts or through other methods when the vested interests a euphemism sometimes used to mean oligarchs don t use the courts or other means to block progress a lot can be accomplished markarova points to this year s success of privatizations of small state enterprises below the radar of the rich and powerful in competitive transparent and well publicized sales the state has already raised hr 1 billion or 37 million in the selloffs she said in using prozorro the online tender system the prices of some assets went up three or fourfold in other areas the tobacco industry has a very strong lobby to thwart high excise taxes leaving ukraine s cigarettes among the cheapest in europe and fueling illegal smuggling to other nations abuses in customs and transfer pricing are also being combatted she said through greater sharing of information with other countries and ukraine s participation in the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent base erosion and profit system sometimes simply abbreviated as beps while entire sectors of the economy remain monopolized or oligopolized she said that the adverse effects can be mitigated through a trifecta of sound public policies better regulation an effective anti monopoly committee of ukraine and better corporate governance markarova also said that cuts in the payroll tax and income tax now 22 percent and 18 percent respectively have encouraged businesses to pay their employees in white salaries officially declared rather than hide the payments when the nation can afford it she said she would favor an even lower income tax than the current 18 percent greater transparency and efficiency in public spending she said will further encourage ukrainians to voluntarily pay rather than dodge taxes it s changing not as fast as it should markarova said of taxpayer attitudes people have to be proud to pay taxes rather than be proud not to pay taxes but she said it s a two way street government has to cut corruption and spend taxpayer money efficiently and transparently transparency is the answer to a lot of problems she said troubled banking sector ukraine s economy is still digging itself out from the orgy of bank fraud and bad loans this decade that have cost taxpayers 20 billion and counting leaving many banks crippled with a portfolio of uncollectable loans and unable to lend money many of the deadbeat loans or non performing loans were issued to owners or insiders before the 2014 change in power which led to the start of a clean up of the sector the national bank of ukraine closed half of the nation s banks leaving about 90 today the central bank also imposed stiff new requirements to prevent insider lending and to ensure the institutions had sufficient capital but we have to resolve the old loans she said otherwise it s a toxic part of the bank we keep dragging on and on and on the deposit guarantee fund is selling off seized assets from the closed banks but not getting anywhere close to the 2 6 billion that is owed to the state treasury we know that we will not get the 70 billion hryvnias that the dgf owes to us markarova conceded today more than half of the sector is owned by the state overseen by the ministry of finance and supervisory boards among the largest state owned banks privatbank oschadbank ukreximbank and ukrgasbank she says they are much better run now since the creation of new regulations and an independent supervisory board of directors for each institution within five years the state plans to own less than 24 percent of the banking sector it s achievable she said there are however bright spots oschadbank for instance won a 1 3 billion judgment against russia for lost assets when the kremlin seized crimea in 2014 but the sector is still not providing the affordable credit needed for the economy to grow more quickly she said not only are interest rates too high but the risk of lending is also too much for many bankers and this goes back to the courts who she said could issue rulings to invalidate loans so that borrowers would not have to repay the bank credit register ukraine however still needs other features of a western lending system one of them is a credit score another is a public credit register listing all borrowers who have not repaid their loans such a register exists but the information can be accessed only by other banks not the general public however for state owned banks markarova firmly believes the names of people who are not repaying loans should be public the country capitalized them with taxpayer money the shareholders have the right to know she said attracting investment the numbers that markarova and the finance ministry crunches would be a lot bigger if the nation had more foreign direct investment which now sits at a paltry 2 billion annually or so for a nation of 42 million people ukraine doesn t have more investment for two reasons corruption and lack of rule of law the no 1 question is judicial reform and rule of law she said the free and fair judiciary is a must look at countries with a high level of investments they go into two types of countries they either go to the democracies market economies where there is a strong judiciary and property rights or they go into horrible places dictatorships but where there are guarantees and you have to deal with just one person ukraine as a fledgling or not free and fair democracy as markarova put it is the worst place for investors investors need certainty uncertainty scares investors they have a lot of countries to choose from ukraine nonetheless has made some progress in these areas for instance curtailing corruption of the road police at the street level while remaking the supreme court into a more reliable dispenser of justice the problems remain with the lower courts she said and such agencies as the security service of ukraine or sbu a 40 000 member law enforcement body with tremendous powers as the successor agency to the soviet kgb it needs to narrow its focus to intelligence and counter terrorism she said rather than investigating economic crimes of regular businesses as it does now it is going to be the first test to see what is done in the sbu she said

reverse last november s rate hike but this month s meeting is seen a bit early the reserve bank of australia cut the cash rate by 25 bp to 1 00 the accompanying statement kept the door open to additional easing another cut as early as august has largely 80 been discounted and there is a strong leaning to yet another cut before the end of the year of course the timing will depend on the growth employment and price developments but the idea that more accommodation will be delivered going forward is deeply ingrained the aussie posted a key reversal yesterday by trading at new highs for the move and then reversing lower to close below the pre weekend low after the cut announcement which initially knocked it back it returned to test the 0 6990 area the intraday technical readings suggest it may struggle to resurface above 0 7000 the dollar gapped higher yesterday against the yen and that gap appears to be attracting prices today the gap is found between last friday s high jpy107 95 and monday s low jpy108 05 there is an option for 400 mln at jpy108 10 that expires today and a 1 9 bln option at jpy108 00 that expires tomorrow on the upside is a roughly 420 mln option at jpy108 50 that will be cut today there is another one billion option struck there that expires tomorrow the dollar rose against the chinese yuan for the first time in four sessions the 0 4 gain is the most since mid may yesterday the dollar reached almost cny6 8350 and today it briefly traded above cny6 88 before closing just below europe italy has taken europe by storm some last minute projections for less spending and higher revenue is allowing the government to forecast a smaller deficit 2 04 rather than 2 40 and improvement in the structural deficit of 0 3 rather than a 0 2 deterioration nearly half the projected savings comes from clawing back funds from social programs that have a low take up according to reports the new projections will make it easier for the ec to do what it wanted and that is to avoid a confrontation now this seems to simply delay the conflict to after the summer when the 2020 budget comes into focus the eu projects a structural deficit more than twice as high as italy the impressive rally in italian bonds which has knocked 20 bp off the 10 year yield since the weekend has done little for italian bank shares an index of italian bank shares fell nearly 1 yesterday and are duplicating that today germany reported a disappointing 0 6 decline in may retail sales the bloomberg survey found a median forecast of a 0 5 increase the disappointment may have been mitigated by the fact that april s 2 decline was revised to only a 1 loss iran announced yesterday that it breached the limit for low enriched uranium it is understood to be a small breach and is seen as a demand that others especially europe and russia provide more economic help in effect and at the risk of over simplifying the treaty ostensibly traded economic aid for a curb on iranian nuclear development the us unilateral withdrawal and embargo is choking the country while europe insists it adheres to the agreement the payments workaround it currently limited to trade for food and medicine which is allowable under the us embargo though dollar transactions are prohibited the euro initially extended yesterday s sharp loss falling to 1 1275 but holding just above the 61 8 retracement of the rally that began on june 18 initial resistance is seen near 1 1320 the 1 13 area may prove sticky with around a 650 mln euro option struck there that expires today tomorrow 3 4 bln euros in options between 1 1290 and 1 1300 expire and then on july 4 another option for 1 2 bln euros at 1 1290 expires sterling appeared to have built a shelf last week near 1 2660 but pushed through it yesterday and follow through selling today saw it approach 1 26 the intraday technical indicators are stretched and the old support 1 2660 should now act as resistance america with us china trade talks resuming we anticipated that the trump administration would turn its attention to europe and japan it wasted no time the us added 4 bln of goods that it will add to the 21 bln of products published in april that will be used to retaliate against europe for illegal subsidies for airbus another round of public hearings will be held in early august with an eye toward adding another 4 bln of goods to the list what differentiates this action from the steel and aluminum tariffs or the threatened auto tariffs is that the us went through wto processes the us action waits for the wto decision on the appropriate level of response that decision is expected in the coming weeks meanwhile the eu has a case against us subsidies for boeing that is making its way through the wto processes the us reports june auto sales a 17 0 mln unit pace is expected retail sales of vehicles in h1 appear to be on track from their weakest showing in six years fleet sales helped cushion the blow auto sales are cyclical and the 12 month moving average peaked in the first half of 2016 near 17 4 mln units output appears to be slowing and high inventories will need to be worked off the us dollar tested and held the pre weekend low against the canadian dollar yesterday cad1 3060 and recovered to close above cad1 31 today it has remained above cad1 31 but has not been able to move above yesterday s high cad1 3145 consolidation is likely today the dollar is also consolidating against the mexican peso it practically transversed the mxn19 00 mxn19 20 range yesterday and is straddling the middle of it today trump has praised mexico for getting control of its borders and has rescinded the tariff threat the dollar index narrowly extended yesterday s advance but is reversing lower in the european morning support is seen in the 96 45 96 55 band it may take a break of the 96 20 area to boost confidence a high is in place disclaimer
in an industry long dominated by the dollar it was a move that carried obvious symbolic weight last summer russian diamond miner alrosa tested a new system for selling its rocks in roubles to clients in countries such as china and india as an alternative to the us currency since then the company has conducted about 50 transactions under the mechanism using a range of currencies says evgeny agureev alrosa s director of sales who says avoiding dollar conversion allows transactions to be conducted more speedily the number and volume of these transactions is relatively small but we think it is valuable for our clients to have a variety of options for settlement to choose from he says in an email adding that the world changes and we need to respond though under consideration for several years the initiative by the partly state owned miner is a sign of a growing appetite to find ways to shake off the stranglehold the us dollar has long held on global commerce and finance those efforts have taken on high urgency given donald trump s increasingly aggressive use of us economic and financial weaponry to get his way in foreign affairs the president has thus far engaged in minimal military conflict but he has proved an unusually pugnacious currency warrior as he pairs a tendency to talk down the dollar s value in his quest for a smaller trade deficit with an unusual willingness to use the currency s global heft as a tool of foreign policy critically sanctions which can block foreign officials or corporations from accessing vast swaths of dollar dominated commerce and finance are being deployed against russia iran north korea venezuela and a host of other countries alongside tariffs and other restrictions on key companies such as telecoms manufacturer huawei as a result economies including china and russia are examining mechanisms to curtail their reliance on the dollar while european capitals are seeking ways to circumvent america s new barriers on dealings with iran to date the initiatives amount to less than a pinprick in the us currency s hegemonic status as underscored by the modest scale of alrosa s foreign exchange innovation but trump s unilateralist approach has unquestionably unleashed a phase of experimentation elsewhere prompting some analysts to ask whether in the longer term the us dollar s supreme position in the global financial system could be shaken as other nations revolt against what they see as trump s arbitrary use of american power a worker at alrosa inspects a diamond last year the russian mining company tested a new system for selling its rocks in roubles rather than dollars photo getty images adam m smith a former us treasury and white house official who is now a partner at the law firm gibson dunn crutcher says the manner in which trump is wielding america s economic power is unprecedented as he uses sanctions tariffs trade negotiations and export controls interchangeably he is using the importance and attractiveness of the us market to the rest of the world as a coercive tool to get others to bend to his will says smith does the very aggressive use of these economic tools make it more urgent for countries to find ways to avoid the us market probably however the urgency may not mean that most countries will be successful in finding effective workarounds america has long enjoyed a singular economic arsenal thanks to the ubiquity of the dollar and the centrality of its economy and financial system to global commerce although america s share of global gross domestic product may have declined its currency still accounts for over 60 per cent of international debt european central bank official benoît cœuré said in a speech in february and leads the euro both as a global payment currency and in foreign exchange turnover it dominates pricing of commodities such as oil and metals and accounts for about 40 per cent of cross border financial transactions the dollar s share of global foreign exchange reserves has slipped in the 10 years since the financial crisis but at 62 per cent of the total it still dwarfs all rivals the euro has lost greater ground over the same time now standing at just over 20 per cent the chinese renminbi is just a few per cent of global reserves and a mere 2 per cent of international payments according to the global transfer network swift this unique place at the heart of the global economic system gives the us government enormous power using the dollar almost invariably means touching a us financial institution says eswar prasad a professor of economics at cornell university this immediately puts you within the reach of us government and regulators the us toolkit is particularly potent thanks to the use of secondary sanctions normal us sanctions aim to prevent american citizens from dealing with a given country or party but secondary measures allow the government to penalise third parties that do business with a sanctioned country the consequences for non us institutions of failing to comply with us rules can be severe in 2014 for example bnp paribas was hit by a penalty of nearly us 9 billion by the us authorities in connection with sanctions violations as well as being forced to temporarily suspend part of its us dollar clearing work while washington s use of sanctions has been on the rise for decades trump has emerged as a particular enthusiast data compiled by gibson dunn show 1 474 entities were subject to sanctions designations in 2018 50 per cent higher than in any previous year for which it has kept records the power of these tools has been felt across markets the treasury s decision to place sanctions on metal groups rusal and parent company en led to a surge in aluminium prices before it agreed to ease its stance if its major shareholder oleg deripaska gave up control the sanctions were lifted in january last august turkey was plunged into a currency crisis as the us imposed swingeing tariffs on its steel and aluminium exports on top of sanctions on senior ministers the us congress has been equally aggressive in pushing sanctions in april a cross party group of senators led by republican marco rubio and democrat bob menendez demanded sanctions against senior chinese communist party officials in response to alleged human rights abuses against uighurs and other muslim minorities in the northwestern province of xinjiang this month senators demanded the more rigorous enforcement of us regulations against chinese companies that seek access to us markets hawks such as rubio want to take matters further and more closely examine china s ready access to us finance republican senator marco rubio wants to examine closely china s ready access to us finance photo ap china poses the greatest long term threat to us national and economic security at a minimum american investors should be aware of where their money is going when it comes to chinese investments said rubio the trump administration s aggressive use of sanctions carries multiple risks it is not only rivals who are upset the us has at times also incensed close allies which for decades have viewed washington as a reliable steward of orderly global markets in the longer term it could accelerate a trend in which other countries wish to reduce their reliance on the dollar for its main three purposes as a store of value a unit of account and a medium of global exchange in the very long run some specialists fear the us dollar s totemic status at the centre of the global economy could be eroded or even supplanted just as the british pound was by the dollar during the interwar period richard nephew a former us government sanctions specialist who is now programme director at columbia university s center on global energy policy says that for at least the next five to 10 years the world is locked into the dollar as the default currency but he argues there will be an evolution towards a system where the us is not the sole significant trading currency us policy today will increase the speed with which that transition takes place a recent report from the center for a new american security think tank argues that a host of factors could conspire to weaken the impact of america s economic policy arsenal over the longer term critically it says that if the us attempts to reduce its economic financial and trading connections with key overseas economies over time us coercive economic leverage over those economies will diminish russia has been at the forefront of attempts to de dollarise spurred on by the punishing impact of us sanctions on its economy we are not ditching the dollar the dollar is ditching us russia s president vladimir putin said late last year the instability of dollar payments is creating a desire for many global economies to find alternative reserve currencies and create settlement systems independent of the dollar russia s central bank last spring sold us 101b worth of dollars from its reserves shifting the holdings into renminbi euros and yen according to official data published in january with a six month delay fifteen per cent of russia s reserves were in the chinese currency last summer the data showed three times the proportion at the end of the first quarter of 2018 for its part china has experimented with denominating oil futures in its currency as well as working on its own international payments system in june russia agreed with china at a summit between xi jinping and putin to do more trade in their respective currencies the rouble and renminbi s share of chinese imports into russia edged up from 17 per cent in 2017 to 24 per cent in 2018 according to the economist dmitry dolgin at ing yet for all the political attention the two countries attempts to reduce the dollar s role remain in their infancy for example china and russia set up a non dollar direct settlement plan to help with their gas pipeline deals around 2015 xi jinping and vladimir putin after a summit at the kremlin in june in which both presidents agreed to do more trade in their respective currencies photo getty images however in practice the chinese side uses it as little as possible in part because of the risk of rouble volatility china has also harboured aspirations to turn its belt and road initiative into a platform for boosting the international use of the renminbi but it would in practice have to dramatically liberalise its capital controls to gain widespread acceptance as a reserve currency in europe frustrations have been growing at the continent s faltering attempts to boost the euro s global role alongside the dollar top french officials including françois villeroy de galhau governor of the banque de france have called for greater use of the euro in international transactions in a bid to challenge the dollar s dominance european commission president jean claude juncker last year said it was an aberration that the eu paid for more than 80 per cent of its energy imports in dollars despite only 2 per cent of imports coming from the us yet the pattern since the financial crisis has if anything been a decline in the euro s international role gita gopinath the imf s chief economist points to a reduction in euro invoicing and international financial transactions the dollar on the other hand has gained relative to the euro in the last 10 years she says meanwhile progress on a high profile mechanism backed by major european countries that aims to sustain trade with iran despite newly imposed us sanctions has been painfully slow sigal mandelker the treasury official in charge of enforcing sanctions points out that despite european efforts to keep their businesses invested in iran following trump s withdrawal from the nuclear deal the companies got out in droves there are people out there who argue we have overused the tool says mandelker if you look at our objectives and how we are using the tool you will see that what we have been doing systemically is to change behaviour to disrupt the flow of bad money and to go after entities and individuals who pose national security and illicit finance risk for all the warnings that the us will undermine its own currency by being so aggressive there is little sign of any diminished appetite for using the greenback kevin hassett the outgoing chairman of trump s council of economic advisers says if you thought that the trump policies were imperilling the status of the dollar then your case would be stronger if you showed that the dollar had collapsed a lot under trump policies but the move in the dollar has been kind of the opposite of that gopinath is sceptical about the chances of near term change you are hearing more noise right now for other currencies to become truly global currencies but the data do not show a more forceful dynamic in this direction and it would take a lot more than what we re seeing now for there to be a switch indeed the irony is that if the president ends up triggering global instability via his policies investors may end up flocking all the more enthusiastically towards dollar assets that was after all the phenomenon during the financial crisis when a mortgage meltdown that was made in the us prompted global investors to scamper for the safety of government bonds and it has been the same story more recently as trump s trade wars drove down us bond yields anything trump creates to foment uncertainty and instability will only end up strengthening the dollar says prasad over time other countries will indeed get tired of this and shift away from the dollar as a unit of account and a medium of exchange he adds but in the foreseeable and longer future the dollar s role as the dominant store of value is unlikely to be challenged additional reporting by lucy hornby in beijing and henry foy in moscow written by sam fleming financial times
an on the ground report by charles g ripley ph d when i landed in ecuador on december 7th 2016 the country was in full swing for its presidential election to be held on february 19th 2017 the official candidate lenín moreno served as vice president 2007 2013 and as the united nation s special envoy on disability and accessibility 2013 2016 under president rafael correa 2007 2017 condemned to a wheelchair after being shot in an attempted robbery in 1998 moreno was a perfect fit for the latter position and as vice president significantly increased budgetary spending on those with disabilities at the end of the campaign moreno squeaked out a victory with roughly 51 of the vote compared to guillermo lasso s 49 the center right candidate moreno s victory was largely attributed to the support of correa s base made up largely of the popular sectors the millions who have benefited from the citizens revolution and parts of the ecuadorian intelligentsia it was a titanic victory for correa s party pais alliance el movimiento alianza pais for the citizen revolution la revolución ciudadana the name of the country s post neoliberal socially oriented movement it served as a defeat for the rise of the right which continues to take place throughout south america the neo liberal economic approach which emphasizes a relaxation of workers rights the privatization of state industries the free flow of international c apital and cuts in education and other social programs lost it was a moment of celebration arriving again three years later the irony was palpable correa s base had lost and the center right grew triumphant everyone expected moreno to be his own person but few if anyone expected such a right turn in addition to the controversial revocation of julian assange s asylum status in the ecuadorian embassy in london moreno has reversed most of correa s progressive policies many of which helped decrease poverty from 37 6 to 22 5 and create unprecedented growth averaging 4 3 between 2006 and 2014 the gini coefficient a measure of inequality fell as well from 54 to 47 the country also witnessed its longest period of political stability in recent memory these descriptive statistics are not from some lefty blog but the world bank itself no amigo of leftist movements with such a successful period in ecuadorian history what exactly happened the common narrative legitimated by the ecuadorian right wing and the u s government which is elated to witness this conservative renewal is that moreno is bringing back democracy and improving relations with the united states and foreign investors this caricature is a very seductive myth reading correa s tweets about moreno being a traitor as well as endless stories of how correa aimed to control the press the restoration of democracy and improving relations abroad are appealing tales conservative leaders are singing and re singing these claims until they become unchallenged truths as brazilian president jair messias bolsonaro 2019 present stated before the u s chamber of commerce nowadays you have a president who is a friend of the united states who admires this beautiful country this is completely false president luiz inácio lula da silva 2003 2011 enjoyed a productive relationship with washington even attracting praise from the arch conservative secretary of defense donald rumsfeld 2001 2006 a similar myth is being touted about argentine presidents néstor carlos kirchner 2003 2007 and cristina fernández de kirchner 2007 2015 now that center right mauricio macri 2015 present won the executive branch i think after going through the kirchner period benjamin gedan former director for the south america division in the national security council and current director for woodrow wilson s argentina project oddly states it is hard to change the perception of argentina overnight as it was for a very long period gedan devotes no attention to the fact that kirchner oversaw the greatest economic and social development in argentina s recent history even prompting former president george w bush 2001 2009 to praise his argentine counterpart the economy has changed in quite dramatic fashion thanks to wise decisions you have made so congratulations for dealing with a difficult circumstance and making decisions that have improved the lives of your people a similar problem is panning out in venezuela although the current government of nicolás maduro 2013 present is accused by the us government and other anti chavismo organizations of human rights violations little to nothing is said of those committed by the conservative opposition which are more egregious conscious of all the propaganda against left leaning latin american movements i traveled back to ecuador in april of 2019 i wanted to witness firsthand what was happening in this andean nation of roughly 17 million people i found that the switch has little to do with restoring democracy improving the economy or putting the country on a path from populism to moderation in fact foreigners with whom i spoke many retirees were impressed with the country s development when i first got here there was little around a retiree from the netherlands said we used to go to colombia and think it was developed he recalled now ecuador is more developed hearing positive comments about correa s presidency was interesting since retirees tend to be of the conservative nature despite many conceding there was corruption in his government most foreigners and locals alike confess there was stunning economic growth even washington d c newspapers admit correa was grossly popular rafael correa was elected president at a difficult time the country was unstable and severely wracked by mismanagement and corruption when he took over the executive branch in 2007 the previous decade witnessed a quick succession of ten presidents the country was in recession and the dollarization of the economy in 2000 served as a last ditch attempt to save an ailing economy but his career in ecuador began earlier armed with a phd in economics from the university of illinois urbana champaign president luis alfredo palacio gonzález 2005 2007 tapped correa as the minister of economics and finance in 2005 after disagreeing with conditionality of the international monetary fund imf correa quit the position in protest lasting not even a year the conditionality policies of the imf were widely unpopular prompting massive street protests throughout various administrations launching a presidential campaign in 2006 under the center left umbrella party alianza país correa defeated his main rival álvaro fernando noboa with 57 percent of the vote the country was in the mood for a change during his ten year presidency he ran three times the government initiated a slew of successful progressive policies correa luxuriated in a time of the commodity boom opposed to allowing a neoliberal free for all however correa demanded more royalties and greater transparency from the corporations in fact he pushed for the controversial mining law ley minera in 2009 to attract foreign direct investment during the commodity boom contradicting arguments that the government was against investment in turn correa was able to dedicate this new windfall of money to efficient social programs to address the country s rampant poverty he expanded el bono de desarrollo humano for example a program that funneled resources to the most vulnerable ecuadorians not only the poor but also the disabled a university study found that this initiative significantly improved the lives of the most vulnerable ecuadorians he further doubled social spending on a broad array of areas including health education and housing pro growth and pro poor policies were not limited to mere governmental subsidies the government enacted important banking regulation it expanded solidarity based financial lending cooperatives savings and loans among other social and economic lending initiated financial stimuli during times of recession and enacted capital controls to earn money and disincentive capital flight capital flight is a titanic problem in developing countries and ecuador has found that the economy had lost up to 30 billion in previous decades correa understood this and enacted various laws to address this perennial economic problem with financial regulation he further supported workers rights particularly those of maids trabajadoras domésticas who he included in the labor laws to protect their rights and fair minimum wage another pivotal policy area was education reform my interviews with educators found that correa aimed to professionalize the education system in addition to increasing primary education spending to 5 of gdp the president worked to set strict guidelines on educational standards in 2012 up to fourteen garage universities universidades de garage were closed due to low standards and fraudulent behavior such garage universities are common throughout latin america they are not well regulated and lack any genuine educational credentials living in nicaragua for eight years 2000 2008 i witnessed their growth when neoliberal governments after the sandinistas left office in 1990 lifted educational regulations correa wanted to address this problem early on he was able to close a number of them down ruffling the feathers of the investor elite who had profited from the low standard higher educational system he also increased educational expectations requiring university rectors to have phds in the end correa s policies helped ecuador develop far beyond the commodities boom an in depth research on the correa years by economists mark weisbrot jake johnston and lara merling conclude that the following policies benefited the country ending central bank independence defaulting on illegitimate debt taxing capital leaving the country countercyclical fiscal policy and in response to the most recent oil price crash tariffs implemented under the wto s provision for emergency balance of payments safeguards this post neoliberal model proved to be fruitful which challenged the washington consensus with such success why would the united states be against correa to begin with the u s government demands pliant leaders regardless of how brutal who support its regional hegemony correa on the other hand did not see ecuador s relation to washington as one of subordination in 2007 he kicked out the u s military base in manta we ll renew the base on one condition that they let us put a base in miami the president stated an ecuadorian base he ceased transactions with the world bank in the same year correa also defied the united states and european union by granting asylum to julian assange in its embassy the ecuadorian elite many with ties to powerful figures in washington detested correa as well the most egregious case was roberto and william isaias two brothers wanted for bank fraud fleeing ecuador and making it to the united states they were able to buy influence with generous donations to prominent senators and even president barack hussein obama 2009 2017 himself in foreign policy he remained close to south american leftists such as venezuelan president hugo rafael chávez frías 1999 2013 and even hosted the union of south american nations unasur an alternative regional organization that excluded the united states and canada such initiatives were seditious for washington generally speaking the united states has the tendency to look down on latin america as well its perennial backyard william k black astutely points out how the new york times offers more favorable coverage of italy s former prime minister 2011 2013 and minister of economy and finance 2011 2012 mario monti than that of correa 2007 2017 the new york times treat monti reverentially and correa dismissively black concludes despite correa being much more successful moreno has done his utmost to undo much of correa s legacy in addition to the controversy surrounding julian assange he has laid off loads of workers slashed gas subsidies and relaxed financial regulations much of the professionalization of education from doctoral degree demands to the closure of garage universities have been eliminated the president even made a 4 2 billion loan agreement with the dreaded imf his economic policies of structural readjustment have hurt working class ecuadorians and produced a backlash in the form of country wide protests the president even was forced to change his minister of economics which is now dominated by the conservatives who voted against him the response was quite brutal even imprisoning protesters and closing down media outlets since moreno is now an ally of the united states any abuses go unheard in the oas much like those of colombian president iván duque márquez 2018 present witnessing a student protest i was shocked at the repression carried out by the colombian police and riot squad foreign policy has also experienced a shift to the right moreno shuttered the unasur building and has curried favor with very conservative presidents although it is important that ecuador maintain cordial relations with south american countries he removed the statue of unasur s first secretary general néstor kirchner 2010 oddly declaring he did not represent the values of our people kirchner was democratically elected president of argentina and stepped down after one term but ironically moreno has supported brazil s bolsonaro a controversial figure who tramples on social rights and celebrates brazil s brutal military dictatorship 1964 1985 of course the ten years of governance under correa were not perfect there are legitimate complaints of authoritarian proclivities and mismanagement not to mention environmental problems related to the mining initiatives nonetheless ecuador s new shift to the right with austerity measures deregulation and the erosion of workers rights may not bode well for the future when president moreno opened the country to the imf and the institutions concomitant policies he claimed our government

house official who is now a partner at the law firm gibson dunn crutcher says the manner in which mr trump is wielding america s economic power is unprecedented as he uses sanctions tariffs trade negotiations and export controls interchangeably he is using the importance and attractiveness of the us market to the rest of the world as a coercive tool to get others to bend to his will says mr smith does the very aggressive use of these economic tools make it more urgent for countries to find ways to avoid the us market probably however the urgency may not mean that most countries will be successful in finding effective workarounds america has long enjoyed a singular economic arsenal thanks to the ubiquity of the dollar and the centrality of its economy and financial system to global commerce although america s share of global gross domestic product may have declined its currency still accounts for over 60 per cent of international debt european central bank official benoît cœuré said in a speech in february and leads the euro both as a global payment currency and in foreign exchange turnover it dominates pricing of commodities such as oil and metals and accounts for about 40 per cent of cross border financial transactions advertisement the dollar s share of global foreign exchange reserves has slipped in the 10 years since the financial crisis but at 62 per cent of the total it still dwarfs all rivals the euro has lost greater ground over the same time now standing at just over 20 per cent the chinese renminbi is just a few per cent of global reserves and a mere 2 per cent of international payments according to this unique place at the heart of the global economic system gives the us government enormous power using the dollar almost invariably means touching a us financial institution says eswar prasad a professor of economics at cornell university this immediately puts you within the reach of us government and regulators the us toolkit is particularly potent thanks to the use of secondary sanctions normal us sanctions aim to prevent american citizens from dealing with a given country or party but secondary measures allow the government to penalise third parties that do business with a sanctioned country the consequences for non us institutions of failing to comply with us rules can be severe in 2014 for example bnp paribas was hit by a penalty of nearly us9 billion by the us authorities in connection with sanctions violations as well as being forced to temporarily suspend part of its us dollar clearing work while washington s use of sanctions has been on the rise for decades mr trump has emerged as a particular enthusiast data compiled by gibson dunn show 1 474 entities were subject to sanctions designations in 2018 50 per cent higher than in any previous year for which it has kept records advertisement the power of these tools has been felt across markets the treasury s decision to place sanctions on metal groups rusal and parent company en led to a surge in aluminium prices before it agreed to ease its stance if its major shareholder oleg deripaska gave up control the sanctions were lifted in january last august turkey was plunged into a currency crisis as the us imposed swingeing tariffs on its steel and aluminium exports on top of sanctions on senior ministers the us congress has been equally aggressive in pushing sanctions in april a cross party group of senators led by republican marco rubio and democrat bob menendez demanded sanctions against senior chinese communist party officials in response to alleged human rights abuses against uighurs and other muslim minorities in the northwestern province of xinjiang this month senators demanded the more rigorous enforcement of us regulations against chinese companies that seek access to us markets hawks such as mr rubio want to take matters further and more closely examine china s ready access to us finance the greenback s unique place at the heart of the global economic system gives the us government enormous power financial times china poses the greatest long term threat to us national and economic security at a minimum american investors should be aware of where their money is going when it comes to chinese investments said mr rubio advertisement the trump administration s aggressive use of sanctions carries multiple risks it is not only rivals who are upset the us has at times also incensed close allies which for decades have viewed washington as a reliable steward of orderly global markets in the longer term it could accelerate a trend in which other countries wish to reduce their reliance on the dollar for its main three purposes as a store of value a unit of account and a medium of global exchange in the very long run some specialists fear the us dollar s totemic status at the centre of the global economy could be eroded or even supplanted just as the british pound was by the dollar during the interwar period richard nephew a former us government sanctions specialist who is now programme director at columbia university s center on global energy policy says that for at least the next five to 10 years the world is locked into the dollar as the default currency but he argues there will be an evolution towards a system where the us is not the sole significant trading currency us policy today will increase the speed with which that transition takes place a recent report from the center for a new american security think tank argues that a host of factors could conspire to weaken the impact of america s economic policy arsenal over the longer term critically it says that if the us attempts to reduce its economic financial and trading connections with key overseas economies over time us coercive economic leverage over those economies will diminish russia has been at the forefront of attempts to de dollarise spurred on by the punishing impact of us sanctions on its economy we are not ditching the dollar the dollar is ditching us russia s president vladimir putin said late last year the instability of dollar payments is creating a desire for many global economies to find alternative reserve currencies and create settlement systems independent of the dollar advertisement russia s central bank last spring sold us101 billion 145 billion worth of dollars from its reserves shifting the holdings into renminbi euros and yen according to official data published in january with a six month delay fifteen per cent of russia s reserves were in the chinese currency last summer the data showed three times the proportion at the end of the first quarter of 2018 for its part china has experimented with denominating oil futures in its currency as well as working on its own international payments system in june russia agreed with china at a summit between xi jinping and mr putin to do more trade in their respective currencies the rouble and renminbi s share of chinese imports into russia edged up from 17 per cent in 2017 to 24 per cent in 2018 according to the economist dmitry dolgin at ing yet for all the political attention the two countries attempts to reduce the dollar s role remain in their infancy for example china and russia set up a non dollar direct settlement plan to help with their gas pipeline deals around 2015 however in practice the chinese side uses it as little as possible in part because of the risk of rouble volatility china has also harboured aspirations to turn its belt and road initiative into a platform for boosting the international use of the renminbi but it would in practice have to dramatically liberalise its capital controls to gain widespread acceptance as a reserve currency anything trump creates to foment uncertainty and instability will only end up strengthening the dollar eswar prasad economics professor cornell university advertisement in europe frustrations have been growing at the continent s faltering attempts to boost the euro s global role alongside the dollar top french officials including françois villeroy de galhau governor of the banque de france have called for greater use of the euro in international transactions in a bid to challenge the dollar s dominance european commission president jean claude juncker last year said it was an aberration that the eu paid for more than 80 per cent of its energy imports in dollars despite only 2 per cent of imports coming from the us yet the pattern since the financial crisis has if anything been a decline in the euro s international role gita gopinath the imf s chief economist points to a reduction in euro invoicing and international financial transactions the dollar on the other hand has gained relative to the euro in the last 10 years she says normal us sanctions aim to prevent american citizens from dealing with a given country or party but secondary measures allow the government to penalise third parties that do business with a sanctioned country financial times meanwhile progress on a high profile mechanism backed by major european countries that aims to sustain trade with iran despite newly imposed us sanctions has been painfully slow sigal mandelker the treasury official in charge of enforcing sanctions points out that despite european efforts to keep their businesses invested in iran following mr trump s withdrawal from the nuclear deal the companies got out in droves advertisement there are people out there who argue we have overused the tool says ms mandelker if you look at our objectives and how we are using the tool you will see that what we have been doing systemically is to change behaviour to disrupt the flow of bad money and to go after entities and individuals who pose national security and illicit finance risk for all the warnings that the us will undermine its own currency by being so aggressive there is little sign of any diminished appetite for using the greenback kevin hassett the outgoing chairman of mr trump s council of economic advisers says if you thought that the trump policies were imperilling the status of the dollar then your case would be stronger if you showed that the dollar had collapsed a lot under trump policies but the move in the dollar has been kind of the opposite of that ms gopinath is sceptical about the chances of near term change you are hearing more noise right now for other currencies to become truly global currencies but the data do not show a more forceful dynamic in this direction and it would take a lot more than what we re seeing now for there to be a switch indeed the irony is that if the president ends up triggering global instability via his policies investors may end up flocking all the more enthusiastically towards dollar assets that was after all the phenomenon during the financial crisis when a mortgage meltdown that was made in the us prompted global investors to scamper for the safety of government bonds and it has been the same story more recently as mr trump s trade wars drove down us bond yields anything trump creates to foment uncertainty and instability will only end up strengthening the dollar says mr prasad over time other countries will indeed get tired of this and shift away from the dollar as a unit of account and a medium of exchange he adds but in the foreseeable and longer future the dollar s role as the dominant store of value is unlikely to be challenged additional reporting by lucy hornby in beijing and henry foy in moscow financial times financial times

analysis on the three different scenarios that could result in europe within a year as the european union tries to bring itself out of the economic crisis for such a small country greece has created a lot of trouble for europe the process of trying to prevent the country from defaulting on its debt has cost not only enormous sums of money but has thrown the whole existence of the eu into question these claims while overly dramatic have an element of truth to them regardless of what happens the eu as it we know it today will not survive the next year the pressures to change are too strong it will transform into one of three different entities the first is a hard currency europe the second is a soft currency europe the third is that the euro zone will survive but with a smaller number of participating countries clustered around germany this too will change the way europe sees itself governs itself and deals with the outside world three possible paths the first of these paths charted by germany france and their close allies in europe is already in the making and if successful will ensure that creditor countries get what they want this is an economic constitution for europe that prevents eu member states from borrowing too much for too long and puts them under direct political administration from brussels if they do not succeed on their own this economic constitution would not be a political constitution however it would be a one sided affair in which national sovereignty and democracy would only be extinguished or constrained for those countries running afoul of the rules creditor countries would have nothing to fear the second of these paths preferred by the us government george soros and some key european policy entrepreneurs has been developed in principle but has not been adopted by european institutions as their first choice policy it involves the issuing of euro zone bonds as leveraged finance to use in shoring up the finances of countries and banks that are proving short of capital if successful it will ensure that financial institutions most of them in the core creditor countries get what they want which is a maximum return on their current investment in greek debt it would also ensure that debtor countries get the fiscal room they need to spread out repayments over a longer period and that ordinary citizens have better economic and job prospects through quantitative easing as many have noted this second path requires a political agreement in order to work over who will be responsible for repaying the bonds that is absent the third of these paths currently preferred by none of the eu s member state governments but an increasing number of citizens became a much more viable option when the possibility was raised of a greek referendum on the euro zone rescue package it involves leaving the euro voluntarily or being driven out for refusing to comply with the demands made by the creditor countries the choice is between a package of tax increases and budget cuts which forces the debtor country to pay its way out of the current crisis or a drop in the value of the national currency once it is re introduced which imposes the cost of adjustment on investors if this were to happen and the precedent were set portugal would very likely follow greece note that none of these options incorporate either a political union or fiscal transfers between the member states neither of these appears to be a realistic option despite the fact that they both are necessary to make a currency union run properly during a crisis we can see that neither option is viable due to the unwillingness of creditor governments to speak about fiscal transfers and the failure of the constitutional treaty in 2004 that treaty was rejected by voters in several countries because it adopted the symbolism of a political union for reasons outlined below this is not about to change why are these the only options and what are the consequences of each path choosing between the paths one way of viewing europe s failure to consider a political union that supports the monetary union is the member state governments attachment to sovereignty despite the achievements of the eu it is still built on the principle that the member states remain ultimately sovereign the treaties are riddled with escape clauses eu legislation is constructed to preserve member state autonomy at the implementation stage so that it builds on national laws and the heads of government in the european council still dominate key decision making as we have seen in the cannes summit patterns typical of international politics outside the eu repeat themselves within it by the dominance of power shared by france and germany over procedure another way of viewing this reluctance to take europe to the next level is the different societal attitudes towards what proper public policy should be coupled with assessments that are made or labels that are slapped on other countries what does it mean to be a state in the eu does it mean responsible finance or fiscal stimulus in the interest of public welfare does it encompass a sense of mutual responsibility and common identity that makes compromise more likely and common eu political institutions more possible or does it divide national societies into us them camps in which eu institutions if developed at all will focus on conflict and domination of those that are on the losing side we can see in the euro zone crisis that the latter has been the dominant pattern it was there at the start of monetary union in the 1990s but was repressed soon after the initial list of participating countries was chosen those sentiments and recriminations never went away but waited for their day of reckoning which is now a third way of viewing europe s situation combines these two factors into economic nationalism and a new kind of conflicted politics within the eu the political scene is highly polarized between creditor and debtor states favoring a hard versus a weak currency with strong versus weak controls on fiscal policy budget deficits and on macroeconomic policy inflation and interest rates more generally we can see this in the polarized nature of the demands being made on portugal and greece but also on the creditor countries through the threat of holding a greek referendum the latter is due to take place no sooner than a month away and after the eu must decide to release further funds to greece or demand that greece leave the euro zone and indeed france and germany put that ultimatum to greece on november 2nd the eu has become ungovernable in important ways as the member states play hardball over the future of the union this fight over the future of europe has volcanic energy behind it there is rage so strong that it is willing to smash highly prized principles of democracy international relations and what the eu has been all about until this point germany the netherlands and finland in particular have lost patience with countries that they depict as deficit sinners to the point where they push for the economic and political stewardship of greece and countries that are similar to it the troika the threesome of the eu the european central bank and the imf that must approve all economic policies in greece if the country is to receive its lifeline of financial support has political control over not only budget policy but a whole host of employment wage public ownership and tax policies greece and others would be identified and treated as failed states whose sovereignty will be terminated for their own good and the greater european good that is the reason their plans might be called an economic constitution if it is established it will be one sided and it will lead to a hard currency euro zone but at the cost of economic growth and of democracy in those euro zone member states that cannot live with the membership rules this constraint on democracy is particularly problematic since the euro itself is so one sided the ecb is obligated to pursue price stability only not to balance it against growth as is the case in the united states if this cannot be accomplished then the second best choice would be the smaller euro zone greece portugal and perhaps italy want to avoid economic and social policy change that the new economic constitution implies in greece the public may very well reject it voters want the euro but not the costs and not the political colonization of the eu and imf that the troika embodies although a weak currency euro zone would suit them best it is now clear that greek voters might be willing to leave at a point in the future if further compromises are not made again a smaller euro zone becomes the second best choice this tremendous energy of colliding demands and rage at the other side is what is driving the current process it also takes place in an environment where financial markets make it impossible to ignore any longer and where the prospect of default on greece s debt and that of other countries makes action a matter of survival either greece is made to pay its creditors in part or the creditor countries must focus on channelling their limited funds into salvaging their own banking sectors this is why the eu is at the point of no return and why the eu as we know it will not survive the next year which path is most likely the dissent in how to proceed from the current point would usually create three possible options in a crisis the sparks released by the current crisis have created a fourth one as well those options are collusion coexistence collision and colonization the first three options are compatible with the continued sovereignty of the eu member states collusion occurs when all member states reach an agreement about the future course of policy we can set this aside for obvious reasons coexistence incorporates a compromise of two views that are difficult to combine which is what existed in the eu leading up to the crisis many of the elements of the economic constitution that the creditor states now want imposed existed before but were compromised by loopholes allowing for political flexibility which in turn were made even bigger in 2005 that coexistence of visions is how europe got into this position in the first place part of the anger of creditor states is at this negotiated coexistence of hard institutions and political finesse that is to end if they get their way that leaves us with two further options collision and colonization it is here that the choices of the member states and of the voters who support and punish them will be decisive and where the primal instincts of what is most important will come forth given that the policy preferences are known to be opposed the defining issue is whether greece and countries like it will separate from the euro zone or whether they will submit to the demands that will be imposed on them if they stay the first of these choices at the least recognizes that democracy and the euro are incompatible for some countries and selects the path of freedom the result will be a smaller euro zone not the death of it once the euro zone countries are over the shock of greece defaulting on its debt they will look back on this episode with a sigh of relief that the conflict was terminated before it could do even greater damage it could still be much worse the second of these choices selects responsibility over freedom and places faith that the pain will reap rewards and that not only the greek finances will be transformed but the hearts and minds of greek voters as well however precisely because creditor states have little faith in them doing this voluntarily they will be forced to be colonized the choice that european leaders and voters face is therefore between these two paths the path of responsibility will lead to a hard currency euro one that dampens economic and job growth in the euro zone for at least a decade and probably more as shock therapy ensues to turn public finances around it will do this at the cost of colonising the eu s weaker member states the eu s growth will primarily take place in the eu s new member states in central and eastern europe for as long as these countries can resist the pressure from brussels to join the euro at the first opportunity the path of freedom and democracy which looked more likely in the context of a possible greek referendum before that option was retracted on november 4th would be more painful and costly for all involved in the short term but beneficial later it will result in three currency areas within europe the hard currencies mostly within the euro zone and characterized by mostly slow growth the ex euro zone countries and the balkans characterized by slow growth and weak currencies and the strong growth countries of central and eastern europe who possess higher rates of inflation interest rates and economic growth what are the implications if the path of freedom and democracy is taken it will have two key advantages once the crisis is over it will allow for the greatest degree of economic growth and development across the single market with rising employment a smaller euro zone would also make it easier for the remaining member states to launch euro bonds more successfully to help themselves and their banks without countries like greece draining a euro bond fund it would be clearer to the remaining members and possible investors like china india brazil and the us that investing in the euro zone worthwhile in short this path is ultimately also the path of greater welfare the choices will affect not only european economic prospects but global ones as well the path that europe takes will decide whether the on going economic difficulties of the current economic depression resemble the patterns of the 1930s or the 1870s the depression that started in the 1870s went on for nearly 30 years interspersed with hopeful bubbles that ended up exploding the extremely tight money supply and rigidity of exchange rates policies taken under a path of responsibility only prolonged the depression if the creditor countries succeed in getting their way today deflationary economic policies will dominate for some time with welfare costs both in europe and abroad the depression of the 1930s was the first to be ended through massive government borrowing and spending precisely because democracy placed new demands on public policy while it looks unlikely that a large euro bond project will get off the ground a smaller euro zone allows individual countries that leave it to do more in this direction choosing the path in which greece and the euro zone go their separate ways will also bury the illusion that all eu member states can and should join the euro regardless of their domestic economies and polities it is that illusion that was most irresponsible in the past the death of that illusion will not be the end of europe it will be the rebirth of realism in eu politics the euro zone will enlarge again when circumstances permit but only with an eye on the facts

and former french finance minister on tuesday after hours of negotiations in brussels over a package of top eu jobs in a statement lagarde said that she was honored to have been nominated and would temporarily relinquish her responsibilities at the imf while eu lawmakers look to ratify her appointment she was chosen because she took on an indisputable leadership role at the imf and i think whoever can do that can also lead the ecb german chancellor angela merkel said french president emmanuel macron said she has the qualities and competence for the ecb she has credibility with the markets i am honored to have been nominated for the ecb presidency in light of this and in consultation with the ethics committee of the imf executive board i have decided to temporarily relinquish my responsibilities as imf managing director during the nomination period christine lagarde lagarde july 2 2019 in moving from washington to frankfurt lagarde will be tasked with driving monetary policy in a 19 nation economy which draghi has already signaled will need more help likely in the form of lower interest rates and possibly with the resumption of quantitative easing inflation is running at barely half the ecb s goal of just under 2 per cent despite years of negative rates and 2 6 trillion euros us 3 trillion of bond purchases investors will likely bet that as a seasoned crisis fighter lagarde will share draghi s taste for aggressive and innovative monetary policy especially as her appointment means the more hawkish bundesbank president jens weidmann misses out financial markets are already pricing an ecb rate cut by september in line with predictions by ecb watchers at bloomberg economics and goldman sachs group inc morgan stanley said the choice of lagarde increases their conviction that the ecb will eventually resume buying bonds moliere s trees lagarde last week described the world economy as hitting a rough patch and advised central banks to continue to adjust their policies in response in june 2014 she said she would certainly hope the ecb would conduct qe if inflation stayed sluggish months before it announced it would do so she also praised draghi s 2012 commitment to do whatever it takes to save the euro and recently echoed his call for governments to do more to battle future downturns in march she linked the need to fortify the euro area to the words of playwright moliere the trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit what bloomberg s economists say the ecb will be a different central bank under lagarde than it has been under draghi but the absence of a ph d may not matter draghi s skills lay as much in navigating european politics as in formulating policy if the new central bank president has just one skill it s the former jamie murray see his ecb insight just last september lagarde dismissed speculation she could take over the ecb telling the financial times she was a bit annoyed and fed up with the suggestion only one economist surveyed last month predicted she would get the job with weidmann seen as the most likely winner in a race dominated by men france has now twice secured the presidency of the two decade old ecb draghi an italian was preceded by frenchman jean claude trichet who replaced dutchman wim duisenberg in common with trichet whose appointment was held up by a trial involving the bailout of credit lyonnais lagarde brings a history of legal wrangles they culminated in a conviction of negligence in 2016 over her handling of a multi million euro dispute linked to the same bank lagarde s appointment also means the ecb and the u s federal reserve will be headed by former lawyers a shift from the era when central banks were run by academic economists such as ben bernanke that opens her up to criticism that she lacks the knowledge to set monetary policy and could boost the influence of philip lane the ecb s new chief economist it is a little puzzling because she s not known as one of the leading economic minds out there said alicia levine chief strategist at bny mellon investment she does though boast political nous which will be needed to unite fellow ecb officials when setting policy especially if they run low on monetary ammunition and need to nudge governments to step up support of the economy she has the political skills needed to build consensus on the governing council is a good communicator and has the standing and backbone to defend the ecb s decisions on the larger european stage said krishna guha head of central bank strategy at evercore isi she would be forceful in calling on member states to make use of the fiscal space eu council president donald tusk dismissed concerns about lagarde s lack of formal economic training she will make a perfect ecb president he said in brussels alongside sabine lautenschlaeger lagarde will be one of two women on the six member executive board they are likely to be the only two female participants in the 25 member governing council which includes the governors of euro region national central banks and has long been dominated by men broader view lagarde was also the first woman to serve as managing director of the imf being first appointed in 2011 and then handed another five year term in 2016 her exit will likely spark a fight between capitals over whether a european should always run the lender or if it s time for an emerging market candidate to do so at the imf lagarde helped negotiate the fund s biggest ever bailout when it handed more aid last year to argentina she also sought to give emerging economies such as china more of a voice in its management while putting greater emphasis on issues including climate change and income and gender inequality that helped broaden the fund s image beyond its reputation as an advocate of budget cuts she sometimes clashed with countries whose monetary policy she will now help set as the leader of one of greece s major creditors she found herself both pressuring the country to accept austerity to keep it in the euro zone while at the same time persuading its european partners to allow debt relief in 2018 she and weidmann disagreed publicly after she called upon germany s government to spend more and close its current account surplus lagarde was educated in france and the u s working as an intern in the u s congress for a time on graduating from the university of paris nanterre she joined the paris office of chicago based law firm baker mckenzie llp she focused on employment law and mergers and acquisitions rising through its ranks to become a partner in 1987 and then its chairman in 1999 then french president jacques chirac launched her political career in 2005 by appointing her minister for trade she went on to serve as minister for agriculture before becoming the first woman to become finance minister in a group of seven economy in june 2007 she held that role as the collapse of lehman brothers holdings inc set off a global recession and paved the way for the euro area debt crisis during the all night talks of policy makers that followed she often sought to boost morale by passing m m s chocolates around fellow finance chiefs if it had been lehman sisters rather than lehman brothers the world might well look a lot different today she once said a past member of france s synchronized swimming team lagarde said her experience in the pool had taught her how to grit your teeth and smile

central bank under lagarde than it has been under draghi but the absence of a ph d may not matter draghi s skills lay as much in navigating european politics as in formulating policy if the new central bank president has just one skill it s the former jamie murray see his ecb insight just last september lagarde dismissed speculation she could take over the ecb telling the financial times she was a bit annoyed and fed up with the suggestion only one economist surveyed last month predicted she would get the job with weidmann seen as the most likely winner in a race dominated by men france has now twice secured the presidency of the two decade old ecb draghi an italian was preceded by frenchman jean claude trichet who replaced dutchman wim duisenberg in common with trichet whose appointment was held up by a trial involving the bailout of credit lyonnais lagarde brings a history of legal wrangles they culminated in a conviction of negligence in 2016 over her handling of a multi million euro dispute linked to the same bank lagarde s appointment also means the ecb and the u s federal reserve will be headed by former lawyers a shift from the era when central banks were run by academic economists such as ben bernanke that opens her up to criticism that she lacks the knowledge to set monetary policy and could boost the influence of philip lane the ecb s new chief economist it is a little puzzling because she s not known as one of the leading economic minds out there said alicia levine chief strategist at bny mellon investment she does though boast political nous which will be needed to unite fellow ecb officials when setting policy especially if they run low on monetary ammunition and need to nudge governments to step up support of the economy she has the political skills needed to build consensus on the governing council is a good communicator and has the standing and backbone to defend the ecb s decisions on the larger european stage said krishna guha head of central bank strategy at evercore isi she would be forceful in calling on member states to make use of the fiscal space eu council president donald tusk dismissed concerns about lagarde s lack of formal economic training she will make a perfect ecb president he said in brussels alongside sabine lautenschlaeger lagarde will be one of two women on the six member executive board they are likely to be the only two female participants in the 25 member governing council which includes the governors of euro region national central banks and has long been dominated by men broader view lagarde was also the first woman to serve as managing director of the imf being first appointed in 2011 and then handed another five year term in 2016 her exit will likely spark a fight between capitals over whether a european should always run the lender or if it s time for an emerging market candidate to do so at the imf lagarde helped negotiate the fund s biggest ever bailout when it handed more aid last year to argentina she also sought to give emerging economies such as china more of a voice in its management while putting greater emphasis on issues including climate change and income and gender inequality that helped broaden the fund s image beyond its reputation as an advocate of budget cuts she sometimes clashed with countries whose monetary policy she will now help set as the leader of one of greece s major creditors she found herself both pressuring the country to accept austerity to keep it in the euro zone while at the same time persuading its european partners to allow debt relief in 2018 she and weidmann disagreed publicly after she called upon germany s government to spend more and close its current account surplus lagarde was educated in france and the u s working as an intern in the u s congress for a time on graduating from the university of paris nanterre she joined the paris office of chicago based law firm baker mckenzie llp she focused on employment law and mergers and acquisitions rising through its ranks to become a partner in 1987 and then its chairman in 1999 then french president jacques chirac launched her political career in 2005 by appointing her minister for trade she went on to serve as minister for agriculture before becoming the first woman to become finance minister in a group of seven economy in june 2007 she held that role as the collapse of lehman brothers holdings inc set off a global recession and paved the way for the euro area debt crisis during the all night talks of policy makers that followed she often sought to boost morale by passing m m s chocolates around fellow finance chiefs if it had been lehman sisters rather than lehman brothers the world might well look a lot different today she once said a past member of france s synchronized swimming team lagarde said her experience in the pool had taught her how to grit your teeth and smile
by judy rugasira kyanda at 8 00 pm on wednesday june 26 news broke that parliament had passed the landlord and tenant bill 2019 in its original form despite several pleas from landlords tenants the financial sector and more recently some enlightened members of parliament and cabinet ministers to review the bill and make it fit for purpose so what does this mean moving on my newspaper article in new vision of april 25 2018 laboured to explain the dire consequences of passing the bill as had been originally drafted for the record and avoidance of doubt i will reiterate some of the points i raised in that article i am a proponent of the legislation good legislation that will enable a strong and stable property market by encouraging and attracting local and foreign investment creating employment in this sector and growing our tax revenue and economy ultimately contrary to what the parliamentarians are claiming the bill as it is in no way protects the small trader or tenant actually it has just made their situation worse by making them more prone and susceptible to the consequences of a weakening shilling and arbitrary rent increments on a more macro level the bill has diminished the comparative advantage of uganda over other countries as a real estate investment destination for foreign and local investors who invest in hard currencies like the us dollars for hard currency rental income streams and better yields on investment it would have been more practical to separate the act regulating commercial and residential tenancies instead of having them regulated under the same act for obvious reasons these tenancies are different and cannot be regulated the same way the law regulating an apartment will not be applicable to that regulating a shopping mall for example the capital costs incurred by a residential tenant to fit out their apartment with movable fittings cannot be compared to those incurred by a retailer in a shopping mall some retail anchor tenants incur fit out costs of up to 5m as such the latter will require guaranteed tenure for the lifespan of their tenancy whereas residential tenants require the flexibility of notice periods the bill as passed has protected small traders from the fixed term of a lease but will impact significantly on commercial tenants as they are not in a position to set up business where they cannot guarantee the full tenure the cause of arbitrary rental increments specific to kacita tenants is simply because the relationship between the landlords and tenants is informal the tenants have no tenancy agreements and landlords take advantage of this treating the symptom of increasing rents is pointless if the root cause has not been addressed you cannot enforce the terms of a verbal agreement and this should not be an option if they hope to achieve their desired objective question why are these challenges of arbitrary and unfair rental increments not seen in the more prime malls where tenants are paying dollar rents answer because the landlord tenant relationship is formal contractually bound by a lease agreement which is signed by a willing tenant and willing landlord prior to the tenant taking occupation the terms and conditions of the lease are very clear both parties know what to expect and there are no surprises a landlord cannot decide to wake up one morning and shut down an entire mall which has become a habit downtown to settle scores with their business partners leaving tenants totally helpless is this also because of dollar rentals this impunity from landlords is because there is no legal recourse all attention and focus have been given to the issue of currency in which rent will be paid and this seems to be the fulcrum on which the need for a landlord and tenant bill is turning however addressing this issue alone is pointless if other aspects of property management and financing are ignored as i have argued before this issue is bigger than kacita and kacita is not uganda nor do they control the property market of uganda in fact even their contribution to the tax revenue of the country is incomparable to property developers owners of commercial properties in the country at large how then do you ban dollar rentals without giving due consideration to other factors in the property development cycle and value chain it is inconceivable to outlaw dollar rents without bearing in mind the impact of such a regulation on the finance sector and the economy as a whole i am hoping that our honourables are aware that dollar denominated loans are cheaper 8 than shilling loans 20 which is why most commercial properties are financed by dollar loans this being the case were the banks consulted on the feasibility of converting these dollar denominated loans into shilling loans in order for the borrowers to afford their repayments they will have to increase the rent extortionately and the tenant will pay the price however there is also a possibility that the banks will not accept to reschedule these loans have the repercussions of this been thought through or the fact that non performing loans will increase repossessed properties will become the order of the day crashing the property market to smithereens the arguments in parliament were that countries like uk us europe china insist on local currency rents this is correct but why for example the usd is found in a pair with all of the other major currencies and often acts as the intermediary in triangular currency transactions this is because the usd acts as the unofficial global reserve currency held by nearly every central bank and institutional investment entity in the world it is for this reason that uganda fixes her exchange rates to the usd to stabilise it rather than allowing the free forex markets to fluctuate its relative value why is this the case because of the volatility of the shilling to many external factors pray i ask is the shilling a globally traded currency when our honourables travel to america are they able to take shillings and exchange them for dollars at jfk airport or london s heathrow for that matter but you can exchange dollars in london japanese yen in switzerland and the euro in south africa the common thread being that these are strong stable currencies no prudent investor will go to america and get property development financing in pounds sterling or euros simply because it would not make any economic sense it would be more expensive to borrow in any other foreign currency than the local currency the usd why because the usd is a strong stable currency and there are several federal reserve banks with adequate deposits to lend at affordable rates in uganda it is cheaper to borrow in usd because the reverse is true it will also make sense to make loan repayments in the same currency as you have borrowed because it is the terms and conditions of our financing institution and dollar rentals are cheaper than shilling rentals because they are more stable minimal fluctuation to cpi at the end of the day 10 00 per square metre converts to sh37 550 and can fluctuate up or down but mainly upwards by up to 30 in one year rentals will still remain pegged to the dollar but paid in shillings subject to the exchange rate and annual escalations on the shilling of over 20 to keep up with interest rates instead of 3 escalations on the dollar as is the market rate so who will be most affected by the dollar rental ban the bill attempts to limit the extent of the above collateral damage to the tenant by stating that rent increments per annum will be capped at 10 are they also going to cap interest rates i am sure the mps also appreciate why our finance costs are high put simply our savings as a banked demographic are low therefore banks do not have enough deposits to lend at affordable rates they in turn need to borrow the money they require to lend to borrowers and this comes at a cost both of borrowing and hedging against forex losses shouldn t we be focusing more on how we can increase savings and deposits as a means to lowering interest rates and stabilising the shilling the need to review this bill is not an option it is a necessity or our property market is going to be destroyed the uganda property market does not operate in a vacuum and is a market which is open to both local and foreign investors not just tenants we must legislate for all with a long term view on things you cannot pass a bill on the whims of one interest group to the economic and social disadvantage of the rest of the country china and america have shown increased interest in investing in uganda s real estate sector i am not certain however that with such legislation which makes the ease of doing business in uganda rankings plummet alongside facing the fear of being imprisoned for annoying a tenant and the inability of a landlord to distress for rent pits uganda as an unattractive investment destination for property i am appealing to president yoweri museveni not to assent to this bill in its current state property experts and professionals have offered their free services to help draft a better bill which will stand the test of time and encourage a vibrant property market in uganda but to no avail the writer is the managing director of knight frank uganda
la paz bolivia ap abraham rodríguez s small shoe store grew into a factory that employed more than a dozen workers during an economic boom in bolivia when prices for the gas and minerals it produces soared today he can only employ one worker he says the tax free import of goods and the black market have affected his sales and have caused him to go into debt my life was better 10 years ago there were sales and the shoe store grew rodríguez said in his workshop located in la paz today the market has reduced my employees left because i couldn t afford to pay their salary surrounded by nations reeling from economic crises bolivia remains a rare example of economic stability and growth and in more than 12 years under president evo morales poverty has dropped steadily in south america s poorest country helped by soaring natural gas production but experts say his economic model is facing mounting challenges including rising debt shrinking reserves and devaluing currencies in its main trade partners and some bolivians are starting to feel the consequences despite the storm clouds morales says he must be returned to power in oct 20 elections as any change would bring chaos bolivia s first indigenous president is one of the few remaining leaders of the wave of leftists who swept into office in south america in past decades about 45 000 artisan workshops in bolivia closed in recent years according to the confederation of micro and small enterprises which estimates an annual loss of more than 2 billion a year in its sector or about 5 percent of the gross domestic product thousands of artisans and other workers swapped their jobs and turned to commerce because the sale of imported electronics and other goods from china became more profitable this meant the number of people who joined the informal sector has swelled to about 50 one of the region s highest rates story continues big industries are also complaining about a slump in the first months of the year with the agroindustry taking the biggest hit and there are less earnings from gas exports and a reduction of the market said hugo siles an economist of the national industry chamber bolivia exports most of its gas to argentina and brazil but its neighbors are facing challenges argentines are frustrated by a recession a sharp depreciation of their currency and spiraling inflation brazilian president jair bolsonaro had a big election victory last year but is struggling to advance his agenda and is also coping with a tumbling currency argentina and brazil have had strong devaluations and that made them more competitive in their exports siles said bolivia has had a fixed and stable exchange rate against the dollar for eight years which means industries that have a high component of domestic input are affected by imports and contraband the fiscal deficit has been rising for six years since the boom in commodity prices ended and it closed at 7 of gdp last year this as well low private investment a sharp decline in currency reserves the increase in public debt with still low international prices and an economy dependent on commodities are causing tensions in bolivia s economic policy said juan pablo bohoslavsky the u n independent expert on foreign debt and human rights the fixed exchange rate to control inflation leads to an increase in import prices and a growing deficit in the balance of payments he said bolivia s external debt rose in march to 10 billion or about 25 of the country s gdp but central bank president pablo ramos discarded the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency the purchasing power depends on the level of prices we have low inflation about 0 6 in 2019 ramos told the associated press this price stability guarantees purchasing power and we must maintain it a few months ago morales said the economy was shielded but his economy minister luis arce recently acknowledged that brazil s crisis will affect bolivia brazil remains bolivia s top market for energy but exports to the region s largest country have plunged due to lower demand and declining fields official reports say that exports fell from a peak of 31 million cubic meters a day of natural gas in 2014 to 23 8 million cubic meters a day in 2017 still the bolivian government remains optimistic and is betting on continuity since morales took office in 2006 the economy has grown by an annual average of about 4 5 well above the regional average and the international monetary fund says it will grow at 4 percent this year experts however warn that growth is largely dependent on savings and external credits from china while the 15 1 billion in international reserves reached in 2014 plunged to 8 billion last march morales is credited for his pragmatic economic stewardship that spread bolivia s natural gas and mineral wealth among the masses but he has lost support following allegations of manipulating the justice system corruption scandals and his insistence in running for a fourth term in office bolivia s long governing president warns that if he is not re elected in october bolivia could break with its recent run of stability and return to a past of economic turmoil influenced by the policies of international organizations before the world bank and the international monetary fund decided the economic destiny of bolivia morales recently said on twitter today our people decide their own future

by neil hartnell tribune business editor nhartnell tribunemedia net the international monetary fund imf last night cut the bahamas projected real gdp growth for 2019 to 1 8 percent and warned that external risks facing this country have increased the fund s executive board in concluding its annual article iv consultation with this nation shaved 30 basis points off the 2 1 percent economic expansion it had forecast for the bahamas as recently as april 15 following the completion of its team s visit it warned that global economic developments had increased the downside risks facing the bahamian economy which is especially vulnerable to external shocks give its openness reliance on the performance of other nations and vulnerability to hurricanes and other forms of natural disasters growth is projected to reach 1 8 percent in 2019 before converging to its potential of 1 5 percent in the medium term the imf executive board said in its statement on the bahamas risks to global growth particularly in key trading partners have increased slowing external demand or a tightening of financial conditions in key advanced economies could adversely affect growth prospects vulnerability to hurricanes and climate change remains high domestically reform momentum could stall delaying fiscal consolidation and the implementation of competitiveness enhancing reforms in the international sector reputational risks could intensify despite the recent strengthening of regulatory and transparency standards possibly challenging existing business models the imf s reference to key trading partners likely alludes to the us and china and their ongoing tariff war over the trump administration s allegations that beijing is cheating through intellectual property theft forcing american companies into ventures with chinese companies to obtain their technology and other unfair terms of trade given that the bahamas imports virtually all that it consumes tariff induced price hikes on chinese manufactured components of finished us goods will inevitably be passed on to bahamian businesses and consumers still adjusting to the inflationary cost of living impact from the increase to 12 percent vat and besides the threats that the bahamas cannot control the imf executive board s statement also expresses concern over whether there is sufficient will both in the government and the private sector to see the necessary fiscal and ease of doing business reforms through to completion the reference to reputational risks seems to concern the bahamas efforts to escape the financial action task force s fatf monitoring list for nations identified as having deficiencies in their anti financial crime regimes this nation s continued presence on the list leaves it exposed to inclusion on the european union s eu revised high risk list and the imf also warned the bahamas to guard against potential spillovers into the domestic financial system from the removal of the walls that previously separated it from the international financial services industry the unification of the two segments was designed to bring the bahamas into compliance with the eu s demand for an end to such so called ring fencing caution was then urged over the central bank s plans to create a digital bahamian dollar to boost financial inclusion especially in the family islands with the imf saying it had to be aware f the potential risks to financial stability the imf s growth revision is likely to have been prompted at least in part by the department of statistics release of the bahamas annual gdp data in may which found that real growth in 2018 had come in at 1 6 percent although those findings which were released after the fund s april statement represented the first substantial economic expansion for five years they were still well short of the 2 3 percent real growth that had been projected for 2018 by both the imf and the government the imf has thus acted to bring its own forecasts in line with the department of statistics given that bahamian real gdp growth last year undershot expectations based on a 10 8bn economy the fund s revised projection effectively slashes the bahamas 2019 expansion by some 32m yet on the positive side 1 8 percent real gdp growth if is achieved still represents an improvement albeit modest on 2018 s performance however it remains well short of the sustained 5 percent growth that the imf itself says is necessary if this nation is to both absorb all new school leaver entrants into the workforce and reduce the existing 10 7 percent jobless rate by 50 percent elsewhere the imf executive board s assessment of the bahamas economic prospects was little different from that given by its article iv mission team in april it repeated calls for the government to operationalise the five person fiscal council and conduct a comprehensive tax review to make the current system more efficient and progressive directors particularly welcomed the enactment of the fiscal responsibility act noting that its effective implementation would bolster policy credibility and ensure durable gains from fiscal consolidation the imf statement said directors encouraged steps to further strengthen public financial management systems tighten expenditure control and operationalise the fiscal council as planned they also saw value in a comprehensive review of the tax regime to enhance its efficiency and progressivity including by reducing distortions and other preferential treatment the imf statement made no mention of either an income or corporate income tax although many observers are likely to interpret the term progressivity as referring to just that the fund also reiterated the need to lower energy costs improve access to credit and eliminate labour market skills mismatches to improve economic competitiveness before the bahamas joins the wto directors stressed the importance of advancing structural reforms to boost competitiveness and unlock the economy s potential for high and inclusive growth the imf added lowering the cost of doing business would help attract needed foreign direct investment following the reforms to bring the bahamas into compliance with the eu s anti tax evasion drive the fund continued directors looked forward to the swift implementation of the new framework for the international sector aimed at enhancing its transparency and monitoring they encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant against potential spillovers into the domestic financial system from the unification of banking license regimes directors also welcomed the authorities initiatives to advance financial inclusion while emphasising the need to proceed with caution on the issuance of a central bank digital

in 2017 47 173 americans killed themselves in that single year in other words the suicide count was nearly seven times greater than the number of american soldiers killed in the afghanistan and iraq wars between 2001 and 2018 we hear a lot about suicide when celebrities like anthony bourdain and kate spade die by their own hand otherwise it seldom makes the headlines that s odd given the magnitude of the problem a suicide occurs in the united states roughly once every 12 minutes what s more after decades of decline the rate of self inflicted deaths per 100 000 people annually the suicide rate has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s suicides now claim two and a half times as many lives in this country as do homicides even though the murder rate gets so much more attention in other words we re talking about a national epidemic of self inflicted deaths worrisome numbers anyone who has lost a close relative or friend to suicide or has worked on a suicide hotline as i have knows that statistics transform the individual the personal and indeed the mysterious aspects of that violent act why this person why now why in this manner into depersonalized abstractions still to grasp how serious the suicide epidemic has become numbers are a necessity according to a 2018 centers for disease control study between 1999 and 2016 the suicide rate increased in every state in the union except nevada which already had a remarkably high rate in 30 states it jumped by 25 or more in 17 by at least a third nationally it increased 33 in some states the upsurge was far higher north dakota 57 6 new hampshire 48 3 kansas 45 idaho 43 alas the news only gets grimmer since 2008 suicide has ranked 10th among the causes of death in this country for americans between the ages of 10 and 34 however it comes in second for those between 35 and 45 fourth the united states also has the ninth highest rate in the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development globally it ranks 27th more importantly the trend in the united states doesn t align with what s happening elsewhere in the developed world the world health organization for instance reports that great britain canada and china all have notably lower suicide rates than the u s as do all but six countries in the european union japan s is only slightly lower world bank statistics show that worldwide the suicide rate fell from 12 8 per 100 000 in 2000 to 10 6 in 2016 it s been falling in china japan where it has declined steadily for nearly a decade and is at its lowest point in 37 years most of europe and even countries like south korea and russia that have a significantly higher suicide rate than the united states in russia for instance it has dropped by nearly 26 from a high point of 42 per 100 000 in 1994 to 31 in 2019 we know a fair amount about the patterns of suicide in the united states in 2017 the rate was highest for men between the ages of 45 and 64 30 per 100 000 and those 75 and older 39 7 per 100 000 the rates in rural counties are almost double those in the most urbanized ones which is why states like idaho kansas new hampshire and north dakota sit atop the suicide list furthermore a far higher percentage of people in rural states own guns than in cities and suburbs leading to a higher rate of suicide involving firearms the means used in half of all such acts in this country there are gender based differences as well from 1999 to 2017 the rate for men was substantially higher than for women almost four and a half times higher in the first of those years slightly more than three and a half times in the last education is also a factor the suicide rate is lowest among individuals with college degrees those who at best completed high school are by comparison twice as likely to kill themselves suicide rates also tend to be lower among people in higher income brackets the economics of stress this surge in the suicide rate has taken place in years during which the working class has experienced greater economic hardship and psychological stress increased competition from abroad and outsourcing the results of globalization have contributed to job loss particularly in economic sectors like manufacturing steel and mining that had long been mainstays of employment for such workers the jobs still available often paid less and provided fewer benefits technological change including computerization robotics and the coming of artificial intelligence has similarly begun to displace labor in significant ways leaving americans without college degrees especially those 50 and older in far more difficult straits when it comes to finding new jobs that pay well the lack of anything resembling an industrial policy of a sort that exists in europe has made these dislocations even more painful for american workers while a sharp decline in private sector union membership down from nearly 17 in 1983 to 6 4 today has reduced their ability to press for higher wages through collective bargaining furthermore the inflation adjusted median wage has barely budged over the last four decades even as ceo salaries have soared and a decline in worker productivity doesn t explain it between 1973 and 2017 productivity increased by 77 while a worker s average hourly wage only rose by 12 4 wage stagnation has made it harder for working class americans to get by let alone have a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents or grandparents the gap in earnings between those at the top and bottom of american society has also increased a lot since 1979 the wages of americans in the 10th percentile increased by a pitiful 1 2 those in the 50th percentile did a bit better making a gain of 6 by contrast those in the 90th percentile increased by 34 3 and those near the peak of the wage pyramid the top 1 and especially the rarefied 0 1 made far more substantial gains and mind you we re just talking about wages not other forms of income like large stock dividends expensive homes or eyepopping inheritances the share of net national wealth held by the richest 0 1 increased from 10 in the 1980s to 20 in 2016 by contrast the share of the bottom 90 shrank in those same decades from about 35 to 20 as for the top 1 by 2016 its share had increased to almost 39 the precise relationship between economic inequality and suicide rates remains unclear and suicide certainly can t simply be reduced to wealth disparities or financial stress still strikingly in contrast to the united states suicide rates are noticeably lower and have been declining in western european countries where income inequalities are far less pronounced publicly funded healthcare is regarded as a right not demonized as a pathway to serfdom social safety nets far more extensive and apprenticeships and worker retraining programs more widespread evidence from the united states brazil japan and sweden does indicate that as income inequality increases so does the suicide rate if so the good news is that progressive economic policies should democrats ever retake the white house and the senate could make a positive difference a study based on state by state variations in the u s found that simply boosting the minimum wage and earned income tax credit by 10 appreciably reduces the suicide rate among people without college degrees the race enigma one aspect of the suicide epidemic is puzzling though whites have fared far better economically and in many other ways than african americans their suicide rate is significantly higher it increased from 11 3 per 100 000 in 2000 to 15 85 per 100 000 in 2017 for african americans in those years the rates were 5 52 per 100 000 and 6 61 per 100 000 black men are 10 times more likely to be homicide victims than white men but the latter are two and half times more likely to kill themselves the higher suicide rate among whites as well as among people with only a high school diploma highlights suicide s disproportionate effect on working class whites this segment of the population also accounts for a disproportionate share of what economists anne case and angus deaton have labeled deaths of despair those caused by suicides plus opioid overdoses and liver diseases linked to alcohol abuse though it s hard to offer a complete explanation for this economic hardship and its ripple effects do appear to matter according to a study by the st louis federal reserve the white working class accounted for 45 of all income earned in the united states in 1990 but only 27 in 2016 in those same years its share of national wealth plummeted from 45 to 22 and as inflation adjusted wages have decreased for men without college degrees many white workers seem to have lost hope of success of any sort paradoxically the sense of failure and the accompanying stress may be greater for white workers precisely because they traditionally were much better off economically than their african american and hispanic counterparts in addition the fraying of communities knit together by employment in once robust factories and mines has increased social isolation among them and the evidence that it along with opioid addiction and alcohol abuse increases the risk of suicide is strong on top of that a significantly higher proportion of whites than blacks and hispanics own firearms and suicide rates are markedly higher in states where gun ownership is more widespread trump s faux populism the large increase in suicide within the white working class began a couple of decades before donald trump s election still it s reasonable to ask what he s tried to do about it particularly since votes from these americans helped propel him to the white house in 2016 he received 64 of the votes of whites without college degrees hillary clinton only 28 nationwide he beat clinton in counties where deaths of despair rose significantly between 2000 and 2015 white workers will remain crucial to trump s chances of winning in 2020 yet while he has spoken about and initiated steps aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans his speeches and tweets have never highlighted the national suicide epidemic or its inordinate impact on white workers more importantly to the extent that economic despair contributes to their high suicide rate his policies will only make matters worse the real benefits from the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act championed by the president and congressional republicans flowed to those on the top steps of the economic ladder by 2027 when the act s provisions will run out the wealthiest americans are expected to have captured 81 8 of the gains and that s not counting the windfall they received from recent changes in taxes on inheritances trump and the gop doubled the annual amount exempt from estate taxes wealth bequeathed to heirs through 2025 from 5 6 million per individual to 11 2 million or 22 4 million per couple and who benefits most from this act of generosity not workers that s for sure but every household with an estate worth 22 million or more will as for job retraining provided by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the president proposed cutting that program by 40 in his 2019 budget later settling for keeping it at 2017 levels future cuts seem in the cards as long as trump is in the white house the congressional budget office projects that his tax cuts alone will produce even bigger budget deficits in the years to come the shortfall last year was 779 billion and it is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2020 inevitably the president and congressional republicans will then demand additional reductions in spending for social programs this is all the more likely because trump and those republicans also slashed corporate taxes from 35 to 21 an estimated 1 4 trillion in savings for corporations over the next decade and unlike the income tax cut the corporate tax has no end date the president assured his base that the big bucks those companies had stashed abroad would start flowing home and produce a wave of job creation all without adding to the deficit as it happens however most of that repatriated cash has been used for corporate stock buy backs which totaled more than 800 billion last year that in turn boosted share prices but didn t exactly rain money down on workers no surprise of course since the wealthiest 10 of americans own at least 84 of all stocks and the bottom 60 have less than 2 of them and the president s corporate tax cut hasn t produced the tsunami of job generating investments he predicted either indeed in its aftermath more than 80 of american companies stated that their plans for investment and hiring hadn t changed as a result the monthly increase in jobs has proven unremarkable compared to president obama s second term when the economic recovery that trump largely inherited began yes the economy did grow 2 3 in 2017 and 2 9 in 2018 though not 3 1 as the president claimed there wasn t however any unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before as he insisted in this year s state of the union address anyway what matters for workers struggling to get by is growth in real wages and there s nothing to celebrate on that front between 2017 and mid 2018 they actually declined by 1 63 for white workers and 2 5 for african americans while they rose for hispanics by a measly 0 37 and though trump insists that his beloved tariff hikes are going to help workers they will actually raise the prices of goods hurting the working class and other low income americans the most then there are the obstacles those susceptible to suicide face in receiving insurance provided mental health care if you re a white worker without medical coverage or have a policy with a deductible and co payments that are high and your income while low is too high to qualify for medicaid trump and the gop haven t done anything for you never mind the president s tweet proclaiming that the republican party will become the party of healthcare let me amend that actually they have done something it s just not what you d call helpful the percentage of uninsured adults which fell from 18 in 2013 to 10 9 at the end of 2016 thanks in no small measure to obamacare had risen to 13 7 by the end of last year the bottom line on a problem that literally has life and death significance for a pivotal portion of his base trump has been awol in fact to the extent that economic strain contributes to the alarming suicide rate among white workers

the ecowas eco currency west africa s response to a single currency zone by kortor kamara usa west african leaders have for several decades since the 1970s intermittently discussed without much success implementation of a single common currency to foster economic growth and integration in the ecowas sub region a significant development in this quest for economic integration was on june 29 2019 achieved with the adoption of the eco as the sub region s single currency effective in january 2020 at their recently concluded 55th ordinary session summit held in abuja nigeria the 15 ecowas heads of state and government including our president julius maada bio adopted a single currency named the eco to be the legal tender in the sub region currently of the 15 ecowas member states in the proposed single currency 8 countries use the cfa franc and the remaining 7 including sierra leone use their own currencies nigeria as the economic powerhouse in the sub region controls two thirds of the regional economy criteria for membership however a threshold roadmap for country participation and adoption of the eco single currency requires adherence to the below 6 criteria 1 must have a budget deficit of not more than 3 percent 2 must have an average annual inflation of less than 10 percent with a long term goal of not more than 5 percent by 2019 3 must have gross reserves able to finance at least 3 months of imports 4 must have public debt or gdp of not more than 70 percent 5 central banks financing of budget deficits should be not more than 10 percent of previous year s tax revenue 6 must have a nominal exchange rate variation of plus or minus 10 percent advantages of a single currency there are several economic and socio political reasons for the establishment and adoption of a single currency in the ecowas sub region however it should be noted that the eco by itself alone cannot be a panacea in bringing about economic stability and growth firstly a single currency brings to an end currency instability in the region and fosters development of a more stable economy secondly the issue of exchange rate uncertainty is mitigated the single currency also eliminates the need to have currency exchanges for trade within the single market zone thirdly there is cost effectiveness as attendant extra currency exchange costs and risks are eliminated fourthly a single currency such as the eco will serve to provide protection to smaller countries such as sierra leone against financial crisis moreover another advantage of the single currency provides for expansion of business markets by entrepreneurs and enables exporters new markets with certainty in the fiscal and monetary arena budgetary discipline is engendered as a single currency de facto restrains and eliminates governments use of discretionary monetary policy to inject artificial booms in the economy governments will thus have very limited opportunities to use inflation as a financing mechanism for their budget deficits disadvantages of a single currency the implementation of a single currency in the ecowas sub region does pose potential pitfalls and disadvantages to both the region and individual countries the loss of national sovereignty is a central disadvantage as countries will lose control over economic instruments such as ability to set their own interest rates due to the centralized decision making at the hands of the ecowas bureaucracy compounded by the inevitable politicization of the eco currency to the advantage of the larger economies smaller economies and countries will be adversely affected the cfa franc countries symbiotic economic relationship with france posses a potential hindrance to the full actualization of a truly ecowas single currency bloc the language barrier between cfa francophone countries and anglophone states will impact labor mobility and may increase unemployment in economic depressed countries is sierra leone ready for the single currency in january 2020 sierra leone as a largely non industrialized economy dependent on importation of even basic food stuffs from overseas has never engaged on a major scale in cross border trade with her neighbors our mineral resources such as iron ore bauxite rutile diamonds are largely exported to europe asia and america and finished consumer goods are from mainly china as a small nation thus the benefits and disadvantages of membership in the single currency zone requires a thorough cost benefit assessment analysis by our policy makers for either decision portends dangers and benefits a first step however in this assessment is determining compliance with the threshold adoption criteria for joining the single currency with an inflation rate currently pegged at 17 46 percent as at march 2019 sierra leone will not now qualify for the 5 percent threshold required for adoption we will not also pass the threshold 3 percent for budget deficit as our nation s fiscal deficit in 2018 was 6 6 percent of gdp the leone currency depreciated by 12 0 percent year on year in 2018 on the plus side sierra leone has over 3 months of gross reserves to finance imports we also have a total public debt to gdp of 66 3 percent in 2018 in conclusion there has not been much public education of the potential single currency implementation in sierra leone very significant transition

people power and profits progressive capitalism for an age of discontent by joseph stiglitz w w norton co 371 pp 27 95 in his latest book columbia university professor and nobel laureate economist joseph stiglitz calls for an innovative public option in the housing market that could use the irs as a mortgage payments vehicle a government employment guarantee for anyone who fails at a private sector job and an aggressive broadening of antitrust action to curb the pricing power of corporations true to his subtitle progressive capitalism for an age of discontent stiglitz clearly believes that capitalism can only progress and even survive with tighter government control but a proper prescription depends on an accurate diagnosis and stiglitz s view on what went wrong with the economy in recent years is marred by many errors of omission and commission making it difficult to take his policy recommendations seriously an advocate of fiscal expansion and tighter regulation stiglitz finds it necessary to dismiss the economic policies of ronald reagan reagan style supply side policies he writes based on the assumptions that deregulation would free up the economy lower taxes would incentivize it and the two together would lead to economic growth however after reagan s reforms growth actually slowed stiglitz offers no data to show that growth did in fact slow later we read as has already been noted growth after reagan s tax cut was not only much lower than he had promised but lower than it had been in earlier decades again no supporting data are given though reagan s economic policies don t need to be treated as gospel growth in real domestic product during his presidency did not run lower or slower than prior periods take for example the enactment of reagan s first tax cutting bill in august 1981 eight months into his presidency from the third quarter of 1981 through the end of his second term the first quarter of 1989 real gdp growth ran at an annual rate of 3 6 percent up from 3 2 percent in the previous 10 years or assume more time for the reforms by starting one s analysis from the end of the 1981 82 recession which was after all a legacy of the inflationary policies of his predecessors from the fourth quarter of 1982 through the first quarter of 1989 it turns out growth ran an unusually fast 4 3 percent when stiglitz does cite economic data he can stumble in pursuing a point about corporations he claims to have found an anomaly in recent years while profit rates have been very high investment rates as a share of gdp have fallen in fact business investment as a share of gdp is high the constant dollar measure of nonresidential fixed investment spending on nonresidential structures equipment and software was 13 7 percent in 2017 above the previous post war average of 12 1 percent how then does stiglitz report a fall through the combined effects of two errors first instead of using inflation adjusted data for the ratio he uses current dollar numbers which result in a distorted pattern second he lumps in residential investment the building of housing with his measure of overall investment residential investment is logically distinct from business investment but not surprisingly it places a drag on the recent trend residential investment remained at a 20 year low in 2018 due in part to the overbuilding leading up to the 2007 bursting of the housing bubble such interpretative mistakes are worth highlighting a professional economist should know how to navigate macro data on gdp growth and capital investment on the issue of corporate practices stiglitz points to a worrisome surge of pricing power keying off a quote from warren buffett the single most important decision in evaluating a company is pricing power he writes market power allows firms to exploit consumers by charging higher prices than they otherwise would and by taking advantage of consumers in a variety of ways higher prices hurt workers just as much as lower wages higher prices do indeed hurt workers and consumers but if consumers really were feeling the effects of greater pricing power it would show up in the standard indexes on consumer prices yet if anything we seem to be observing a trend toward pricing powerlessness the year on year rise of the personal consumption expenditures deflator the main price index tracked by the federal reserve keeps failing to reach its target of 2 percent over recent 10 year periods the pce has risen at average annual rates of 1 3 percent to 1 6 percent slower than for any 10 year period since 1959 as far back as the series goes moreover almost all the price inflation has shown up in the services part of the pce the goods portion of the pce where corporations targeted by stiglitz play a larger role has been experiencing inflations at a rate barely above zero if he is correct that corporations have tried to exercise pricing muscle he should have added that they ve made quite a hash of it on income inequality the author has appalling news it s not just that the distribution of gains has been unequal virtually no gains at all have gone to the bottom 90 percent he provides a chart spanning from 1974 to 2014 which shows that over the four decades the average income of the bottom 90 percent has hardly changed while that of the top 1 percent has soared but as hoover institution economist russell roberts has noted data of this kind consist of snapshots over time and people in the snapshots are not the same people roberts reviews longitudinal studies tracking the same people over time which show that the poor and middle class have in fact realized substantial income gains over the decades in his professional career stiglitz has affirmed interventionist government in ways that turned out to be sadly misplaced in fall 2007 for example when the world bank where he himself had been chief economist was publicly expressing concern about developments in venezuela stiglitz visited caracas and praised the country s then leader hugo chavez for his statist economic policies those policies as is now evident brought ruin to venezuela in this book he calls himself all too prescient about the great recession but he fails to mention the 2002 consulting report he co authored on the mortgages held by government sponsored enterprises fannie mae and freddie mac both major contributors to that crisis though the holdings of these entities were already risky by conventional standards he and his co authors concluded that the risk was effectively zero instead of learning from past errors however stiglitz compounds them in his new book the u s economy could improve in serving human needs by say rolling back zoning restrictions that make housing obscenely costly in cities like new york and san francisco eliminating occupational licensing requirements which impede job mobility and expanding offerings of vouchers and charter schools to give poor families more options given his fuzzy understanding of what s actually hurting the u s economy stiglitz s prescriptions would likely make the patient only sicker photo by thomas peter pool getty images

expectation is that banks will be holding back on passing on the full cut as they seek to balance out mortgage rates with deposit rates and protect net interest margins he said on tuesday the rba cut rates in june which was the first rate cut since august 2016 while home borrowers win from lower interest rates they are bad for retirees and people who live off fixed interest it is also bad news for

rate cuts became less effectual either way one per cent is likely to be close to the lowest rate before more aggressive non conventional forms of policy intervention would need to be considered he

listen to this article your browser does not support the audio tag the extensive lines outside the stores with shelves mostly unsupplied are increasingly common in cuba people stand in line to buy rice at a state store in the center of havana cuba reuters israel hidalgo and his wife left home around 7 30 a m to reach a supermarket across havana because they heard it might be selling chicken a staple of the cuban diet increasingly scarce on the shortage plagued island after cuba started limiting sales this month partly blaming tightened u s economic sanctions on the communist run island the couple wanted to buy as much as possible and lined up for three hours under the caribbean sun to get tickets guaranteeing them their rations inside they lined up again to collect two bags of chicken thighs each as fellow shoppers elbowed one another in pursuit of their own rations and headed for the checkout feeling like they had won the lottery we were born in this revolution and are used to rough times said hidalgo a 61 year old blacksmith we are bracing ourselves for it to get worse long lines outside shops with mostly bare shelves are increasingly common in cuba and the government has indeed signaled that things are going from bad to worse cuban president miguel diaz canel in a speech last month accused the trump administration of engaging in an asphyxiating financial persecution that makes the import of goods and resources of primary necessity particularly difficult the degree to which new u s sanctions due in part to cuba s support for venezuelan president nicolas maduro have compounded its economic woes is open to debate the economy had already stagnated in recent years in tandem with the implosion of strategic ally venezuela resulting in cuts in fuel and energy use by state entities and this year shortages of basic goods such as bread chicken and eggs but the increase in sanctions which have hit the key tourism sector and added to investor and bank jitters about dealing with cuba has some economists predicting the economy will slip from stagnation into a full blown recession later this year the economy has averaged 1 annual growth over the last three years compared with the 5 to 7 rate economists say is needed to recover fully from the depression caused by the fall of its former benefactor the soviet union in 1991 while the crisis will not be as bad as in the 1990s it will have a worrying social impact on the most vulnerable households which are already on subsistence salaries said pavel vidal a former cuban central bank economist who teaches at colombia s universidad javeriana cali bracing for harder economic times the government has resorted to what it knows best to manage the crisis and prevent social unrest more control interior commerce minister betsy diaz said two weeks ago the government would temporarily ration sales of a handful of basic products like eggs on a monthly basis using ration books distributed after the 1959 revolution and limit the sale of others like chicken to ensure everyone gets their fair share also read the essence of the salvadorean gangs that no government can break a critical moment people buy chicken in a supermarket in havana cuba reuters some cuban economists say the developing crisis stems fundamentally from an inefficient centrally planned economy that imports more than two thirds of its food needs calling rationing little more than a short term solution they say the government must open up to a series of market oriented economic reforms before the crisis deepens this could be a critical moment that generates the consensus necessary to apply changes said vidal the government needs to give more space to the private sector and investment cuba has enacted some economic reforms in recent years including expanding the private sector from 2010 onward and introducing a new foreign investment law that cut taxes by around 50 in 2014 but local economists like omar everleny say the reforms undertaken have been too cautious so far the government has backtracked on overhauls of areas like agriculture and the dominant public sector remains deeply inefficient cuba was already behind on an estimated 1 5 billion dollars in short term commercial debt and warning of austerity before u s president donald trump started the latest round of tightening of the decades old u s trade embargo aid from venezuela in the form of subsidized oil had long masked the true extent of cuba s economic problems but it started to fall from 2015 when a drop in oil prices roiled that opec nation s economy venezuela s crude shipments to cuba are now about half what they were four years ago and they could soon fall further last month the united states also began targeting vessels and companies that ship oil to the island from venezuela for sanctions threatening the energy grid and transportation u s sanctions against its old cold war foe are also hitting the two bright spots in the otherwise glum economy tourism and foreign investment both had boomed briefly after the announcement of a cuba u s detente in 2014 tourism revenues dropped by 4 6 in 2018 according to official data released last month the announcement in 2017 of tighter travel restrictions on u s citizens played a role at one point u s visits dropped more than 40 percent cuban tourism minister manuel marrero told reuters adding he still hoped tourism would grow this year meanwhile the trump administration has activated a long dormant law under which cuban americans can sue foreign companies that profit from their properties nationalized during the first years of the 1959 revolution western diplomats and businessmen have called the threat of potentially costly u s court battles another clear disincentive for banks and outside investors to do business with cuba the united states has also threatened to further tighten restrictions on travel and to impose a cap on cash remittances to cuba measures that could hit the economy hard siege mentality cuba s government has said it will continue moving down the path toward reform but it has failed to respond so far to calls from the island s entrepreneurs for basic changes such as the creation of wholesale markets for the private sector and the right to import and export instead of opening the economy further some western diplomats and analysts say there is risk cuba s leadership will adopt a siege mentality in the face of increased u s hostility that could mean turning to allies like russia vietnam and china for help to muddle through while keeping its stranglehold on economic life the u s sanctions could be counterproductive said one diplomat who asked not to be identified cuba has historically closed up at times like these cubans are not going hungry like they did during the so called special period after the collapse of the soviet union but they are increasingly connected to the rest of the world via the internet and foreign travel and many have grown weary of government attempts to blame the u s embargo for the bulk of their country s woes we are in total freefall said hidalgo s wife carmen lozano 55 clinging to her two bags of rationed chicken they should have allowed free production and sales from the beginning of the revolution inequality has risen in recent years in cuba and many believe the economic crisis could have a more disproportionate impact now than it might have in the past in a country where the government s claim to legitimacy rests to a large extent on ensuring a certain level of equality the authorities seem well aware that most people lack the cash to stock up on whatever basics they need on the black market the government s new rationing program is trying to address that simmering discontent by making the small quantities of goods that are in stock more widely available said william leogrande a professor of government at american university the government understands that discontent over the economy is their biggest political vulnerability so they will do everything they can to maintain supplies of basic goods reuters sarah marsh

from 1974 to 2014 which shows that over the four decades the average income of the bottom 90 percent has hardly changed while that of the top 1 percent has soared but as hoover institution economist russell roberts has noted data of this kind consist of snapshots over time and people in the snapshots are not the same people roberts reviews longitudinal studies tracking the same people over time which show that the poor and middle class have in fact realized substantial income gains over the decades in his professional career stiglitz has affirmed interventionist government in ways that turned out to be sadly misplaced in fall 2007 for example when the world bank where he himself had been chief economist was publicly expressing concern about developments in venezuela stiglitz visited caracas and praised the country s then leader hugo chavez for his statist economic policies those policies as is now evident brought ruin to venezuela in this book he calls himself all too prescient about the great recession but he fails to mention the 2002 consulting report he co authored on the mortgages held by government sponsored enterprises fannie mae and freddie mac both major contributors to that crisis though the holdings of these entities were already risky by conventional standards he and his co authors concluded that the risk was effectively zero instead of learning from past errors however stiglitz compounds them in his new book the u s economy could improve in serving human needs by say rolling back zoning restrictions that make housing obscenely costly in cities like new york and san francisco eliminating occupational licensing requirements which impede job mobility and expanding offerings of vouchers and charter schools to give poor families more options given his fuzzy understanding of what s actually hurting the u s economy stiglitz s prescriptions would likely make the patient only sicker photo by thomas peter pool getty images

more than 8 700 newly created opportunity zones are now racing to attract a portion of the 6 trillion in capital that may flow under a provision of the new tax law enacted in 2017 the law uses a package of tax incentives to jumpstart economic development in distressed communities by financing local startups building small businesses or developing properties but there are also opportunities for education institutions and workforce development programs a lack of investment in distressed communities a growing body of research has revealed geographic prosperity gaps across the united states recent economic growth is concentrated in large metropolitan areas with populations of over 1 million which have experienced 72 percent of the nation s job growth since the financial crisis nearly half of the net increase in business establishments from 2007 to 2016 took place in just two cities washington d c and new york city millions of americans now live in distressed communities characterized by higher rates of poverty and lower levels of income educational attainment and workforce participation pockets of the country also struggle with higher rates of deaths of despair due to suicide drugs and alcohol symptomatic of a larger sense of lost opportunity figure 1 distressed communities are home to millions of americans in distressed communities poverty is higher and educational attainment is lower source economic innovation group 2018 distressed community index too many communities have become poverty traps it s no wonder that economist raj chetty has found that where children grow up matters for their economic prosperity as adults working with the u s census bureau chetty and his team at opportunity insights were able to produce an opportunity atlas that mapped the disparities neighborhood by neighborhood chetty and team found that a low income child growing up in a less poor community is more likely to climb the economic ladder than a child who spends her entire life in a low income area in 2015 the economic innovation group a bipartisan policy center launched by sean parker brought together a group of economists from across the political spectrum to discuss possible causes of these troubling trends and identify potential solutions these experts discovered that while struggling communities each faced a series of complex and interrelated challenges they shared one common barrier a lack of access to capital needed for community and economic development projects distressed communities have hopes and dreams but no one is investing in them the federal reserve found that banks now make fewer loans of less than 1 million than they did before the recession nearly 75 percent of all venture capital is invested in just three states california massachusetts and new york philanthropic support is also concentrated in a handful of areas an analysis of overall philanthropic giving revealed that alabama receives an average of 130 per capita in grantmaking below the national average of 451 and well below the new york city average of 1 966 when it comes to education the philanthropy roundtable estimates that 90 percent of k 12 giving is concentrated in urban areas the economists assembled by economic innovation group proposed designating these distressed communities opportunity zones and offering investors incentives to funnel capital into revitalization projects the concept drew the support of a bipartisan congressional coalition led by senators tim scott r sc and cory booker d nj and representatives pat tiberi r oh and ron kind d wi with a group of almost 100 cosponsors the legislation was eventually included in the broader overhaul of the tax code signed into law in 2017 how does the opportunity zone program work the program consists of two parts the first asked governors to identify up to 25 percent of their low income census tracts for certification by the u s treasury department as opportunity zones these designations last ten years and cannot be changed states territories and the district of columbia designated a total of 8 700 opportunity zones which are home to nearly 35 million americans figure 2 where are the opportunity zones governors identified up to a quarter of their low income census tracts for opportunity zone certification source policymap the second part creates a qualified opportunity fund a new investment vehicle to finance projects within opportunity zones after investors sell appreciated assets such as stocks bonds real estate or businesses they can reinvest the money gained from those sales into a qualified opportunity fund these qualified opportunity funds then invest in certain equity financed projects located in an opportunity zone including businesses property redevelopment or new construction the law offers investors three tax incentives that grow the longer the investment stays in an opportunity zone deferred payment of the federal capital gains taxes on the reinvested amount until 2026 a tax liability reduction of up to 15 percent if they hold the investment for up to seven years and no taxes on any generated gains from that investment if held for at least ten years benefits for communities and investors this approach has several strengths it offers low income communities a flexible tool to support their own local approaches to economic development some may need affordable housing while others need broadband or capital for growing businesses it also rewards patient capital investors must hold their investments in the community for at least ten years to secure all the benefits opportunity funds allow for enormous flexibility in terms of who can establish them what they invest in where they invest and whether the fund s goal is to maximize social impact or balance financial returns fund managers can be institutional banks community development finance institutions universities or impact investors funds can focus on a single city or support projects anywhere in the country unlike other economic development programs such as new markets tax credits there are no caps on the number of funds or the investment amounts that can be raised already there are at least 90 funds with nearly 30 billion pledged a number expected to grow as the treasury provides additional regulatory clarity economic innovation group estimated there are 6 trillion in unrealized capital gains that are eligible to reap the tax benefits the law provides potential drawbacks and problem areas while the opportunity zone program offers significant potential for positive impact there are several areas of risk previous placed based policies including empowerment zones enterprise communities renewal communities and promise neighborhoods have had mixed results as the california budget and policy center put it the inconclusiveness of the research exploring the connection between economic development tax incentives and community outcomes suggests that the costs of such incentives may outweigh the benefits these past efforts targeted the tax incentives on a project by project basis in an expensive cumbersome and time consuming process that discouraged many from applying the authors of the opportunity zone policy sought to remedy this by focusing the tax incentive on investors instead of projects once funds are pooled in an opportunity fund they can be invested in projects through the familiar processes and timelines used for most investments risk is also shared under this structure as investors and fund managers must identify good projects in order to make the investment pay off given the history of past policies and programs it is possible that investments may lead to gentrification displacement and inequitable development but this risk is likely localized to a handful of regions such as san francisco new york city and washington d c new research by the university of minnesota law school s institute on metropolitan opportunity found that the most common type of change over the last two decades has been not gentrification but rather poverty concentration in areas where there is a population displacement risk mayors and state policymakers can also use other financial incentives and permitting processes to help prevent displacement and encourage projects with greater social impact such as prioritizing affordable housing over a market rate condo a further critique of many placed based programs is that they result in tax giveaways for investment that would have occurred anyway investors could flock to the projects that have known deal pipelines such as real estate in the markets they know best such as major metropolitan areas instead of taking on challenging projects in struggling locales addressing this risk requires new services to help investors and project organizers find each other across the 8 700 zones one such service is the opportunity exchange which is working with several cities and states to serve as a searchable listing of projects the platform also assigns a social impact score based on the oz reporting framework developed by the u s impact investing alliance the beeck center for social impact and innovation at georgetown university and the federal reserve bank of new york expanding services like the opportunity exchange can help connect overlooked communities and high impact projects with investors even so the opportunity zones program lacks the organizational infrastructure taken for granted in the education sector there isn t something like chiefs for change for opportunity zone coordinators or the council for chief state school officers for state economic development directors thanks to the work of the economic innovation group accelerator for america and the local initiatives support corporation there are more ways for participants to share best practices but philanthropic support of capacity building organizations will be critical to the program s long term success how can opportunity zones impact education education and workforce institutions are the backbone of most communities if the goal of the opportunity zones program is to empower residents then investing in educational opportunities will deliver powerful results for future generations and future success early childhood and afterschool care high quality affordable childcare is essential to families economic stability parents ability to work and children s healthy development many distressed communities however are afterschool deserts where families have limited access to afterschool care tutoring and other enrichment programs qualified opportunity funds could be used to purchase or build new facilities or rehabilitate existing ones for providers the city of dayton ohio for example is pitching investors the chance to build a new public library and afterschool community center investments could even finance small businesses operating tutoring or early care programs elementary and secondary schools according to the 21st century school fund there are 13 536 elementary or secondary public schools located in opportunity zones on average 71 percent of students in these schools come from low income families many of these schools are also struggling likely reflecting the distressed communities they re serving greatschools provides a snapshot of school quality based on data indicators and found that the average rating for schools located in opportunity zones was 4 0 out of 10 0 compared to 5 2 for those located outside an opportunity zone school districts in these low wealth areas could tap into qualified opportunity funds to improve their buildings to deliver these modern schools developers and a school district could form a public private partnership using ground leases to transfer building ownership to private investors while leaving the local school district in control of ongoing operations the investment from a qualified opportunity fund could then finance the renovations with ownership returning to the district at the end of the term this approach can be used by district schools charter schools and private schools the 21st century school fund has also suggested that developers partner with school districts to modernize underutilized school facilities as mixed use community centers involving partners such as health facilities childcare centers libraries and even elder care service centers this approach is aligned with that of many emerging community schools which work with families students and community organizations to identify and address unmet needs developers can also incorporate new school construction into their projects for example the developers behind greenpoint landing in brooklyn new york are building 5 500 new apartments 1 400 which will be affordable along with nine acres of parks and a new public school serving preschoolers through 8th graders other cities with large development projects could embrace a similar approach there are ways to leverage these resources for adjacent needs as well rbh group is using opportunity zones to finance workforce housing for teachers in teacher villages a strategy that could be important for cities with a higher cost of living charter schools while at least 22 percent of charter schools are located in opportunity zones nearly 70 percent of opportunity zones are actually charter deserts or areas of three or more contiguous moderate to high poverty census tracts without charter elementary schools all things being equal a charter network may want to consider expansion into opportunity zones to tap into qualified opportunity funds an additional source of facilities funding that can complement other forms of financing developers can also include charters or private schools in mixed used properties built using opportunity funds starwood capital group for example announced a development in the south bronx that will be home to zeta charter school along with retail and apartment units even if charters don t receive any opportunity fund investment they can be part of a community s revitalization plan in florida charter schools can apply to be schools of hope which allows their networks to establish new charters near low performing schools governor ron desantis has proposed expanding the program to allow charters to serve students in other opportunity zones potentially bringing new education options to children in distressed areas colleges and universities nearly every governor designated opportunity zones near universities and research institutions creating the potential for commercializing research supporting technology transfer incubating student startups and expanding student housing universities can serve as important anchor institutions in facilitating community planning arizona state university and the university of delaware are already playing this role by leveraging their faculty research and convening abilities to assist communities with planning and development higher education institutions can also benefit from qualified opportunity fund investments almost half of historically black colleges and universities are located in opportunity zones some of these campuses will receive investment from a newly created 50 million opportunity fund led by renaissance equity partners the hbcu community development action coalition and calvert impact capital similar funds could be established to support projects near community colleges or other institutions for example some research has suggested that when students live on campus graduation rates tend to be higher opportunity funds could allow colleges to expand student housing to serve more students and thereby improve outcomes universities can also leverage their proximity to opportunity zones to create entrepreneurship incubators for students qualified opportunity fund investments could support building a dedicated facility and provide start up capital for the most promising ventures workforce training programs communities have to create workforce development programs to give residents the skills needed for new jobs and to attract business development from companies that require those skills governor larry hogan for example is targeting state job training funds in maryland opportunity zones workforce training providers can also benefit from qualified opportunity funds to build out services the technology apprenticeship provider kenzie academy is located in an opportunity zone in indianapolis which allows it to tap into qualified opportunity funds as part of its fundraising rounds kenzie also recently announced a partnership with hypothesis studios that will use kenzie graduates as candidates for roles at the startup organizations in hypothesis portfolio some opportunity zone businesses are even providing job training michigan based chart house energy uses investments from qualified opportunity funds to install solar panels and pass discounted energy costs to host facilities which may include schools but the company has also committed to hiring and training local residents creating a new employment pipeline and driving inclusive growth business incubators can provide workspace seed funding mentoring and training for entrepreneurs in fields like tech and advanced manufacturing in ohio the youngstown business incubator and bounce innovation hub offer places for entrepreneurs to learn more about advancing manufacturing and 3d printing in michigan projects like the detroit grocery incubator help address the problem of food deserts by supporting entrepreneurs who wish to set up local grocery stores entrepreneurs growing local businesses is an important part of addressing poverty and one of the primary objectives of the opportunity zone program according to the kauffman foundation for every 1 percent increase in the rate of new businesses started in a state there is a 2 percent decline in the poverty rate opportunity zones give investors the chance to add qualified opportunity funds to their portfolios and thereby support overlooked entrepreneurs in distressed communities hypothesis studios for example is searching for mission driven founders in opportunity zones who are trying to make an impact in sectors including healthcare technology education technology agricultural and the internet of things modeled after the famous edison labs hall labs in utah has 25 companies and employs more than 200 engineers scientists and specialists hall venture partners is launching an opportunity fund giving investors the chance to participate this same approach could be used by education investors to attract private capital to the launch and growth of education and workforce solutions it could also be used to help target underserved populations such as minority or female entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs launching their startups in an opportunity zone creates a new fundraising advantage for example the next generation assessment startup imbellus is located in the heart of a distressed opportunity zone in culver city california which means the company is eligible to receive opportunity fund investment as part of its next venture raise this additional capital would help imbellus accelerate its work developing new assessments through learning science psychometrics and artificial intelligence incubators and accelerators could also be established within a zone to help jumpstart new education businesses or nonprofits matt candler of 4 0 schools for example is exploring the use of qualified opportunity funds to develop small creativity boosting approachable spaces like microschools and maker spaces facilitating the success of opportunity zones investment is not guaranteed just because a community is designated an opportunity zone it is up to mayors community leaders and local business leaders to bring projects to investors define priorities and provide additional support only then will opportunity zones drive inclusive growth how policymakers can help mayors and governors are well positioned to identify community assets and needs by evaluating current conditions in their opportunity zones to this end the accelerator for america and new localism advisors is working with cities like cleveland ohio erie pennsylvania louisville kentucky stockton california and south bend indiana on investment prospectuses that describe local demographic and economic trends assets and anchor institutions and potential projects for investors the local initiatives support corporation has also released a playbook to help communities with their planning education and workforce institutions need to join these discussions to inform the work and potentially benefit from investment policymakers will need to leverage state support through grant preference points eligibility criteria or other state incentives to make projects in their opportunity zones more attractive for investors so far more than 150 bills addressing some or all of these policy levers have been introduced this year proposed legislation in alabama for example would provide 50 million in tax credits to impact oriented qualified opportunity funds which benefit projects in rural areas technology companies workforce training providers and affordable housing developments but state policymakers do not necessarily have to pledge new funds and in many cases can use existing state and federal dollars the u s department of education is giving competitive preference to career and technical education projects serving opportunity zones under the innovation and modernization grant program within the perkins act a federal law funding career and technical education states can follow the federal government s lead by making the opportunity zone designation an indicator of need in their own state grant programs or they can award bonus points for competitive grants allocated under the every student succeeds act these approaches allow states to encourage the types of development they want to see in opportunity zones and prioritize the projects most likely to benefit residents the role of philanthropic organizations philanthropies also have a critical role in the success of opportunity zones particularly in terms of capacity building foundations can support local planning or provide funding for a dedicated opportunity zone coordinator along these lines the rockefeller foundation announced that six cities will receive financial support for the hiring of a chief opportunity zone officer who will be embedded in a city government or a city economic development agency and two community engagement specialists the economic innovation group is also in the process of securing support for a forum where opportunity zone coordinators can exchange best practices and develop shared strategies qualified opportunity funds also give foundations another tool besides traditional grants and program related investments for education and education adjacent foundations these funds offer unique opportunities to improve student outcomes a whole child opportunity fund for example might complement school based philanthropic endeavors by investing in a new grocery store in a food desert building affordable housing for a low income community or creating dedicated space for tutoring and afterschool programs though these projects would normally be outside their grantmaking scope qualified opportunity funds let foundations address pressing needs by leveraging outside capital directed at mission aligned projects opportunities are what we make of them the opportunity zones program is the largest community development initiative in a generation but its success isn t guaranteed policymakers mayors community leaders investors developers and philanthropic organizations will have to work together to get the best results for opportunity zone residents if education leaders pursue these investment opportunities they too can benefit from the program and ensure better outcomes for those in distressed communities for generations to come john bailey is an advisor to the walton family foundation and a visiting fellow at the american enterprise institute he previously created the opportunity zone proposal announced by president bush in 2004
joseph e stiglitz a nobel laureate in economics is a professor at columbia university and a member of the independent commission for the reform of international corporate taxation in some ways it s a curious time to be launching an alternative currency in the past the main complaint about traditional currencies was their instability with rapid and uncertain inflation making them a poor store of value but the dollar the euro the yen and the renminbi have all been remarkably stable if anything the worry today is about deflation not inflation the world has also made progress on financial transparency making it more difficult for the banking system to be used to launder money and for other nefarious activities and technology has enabled us to complete transactions efficiently moving money from customers accounts into those of retailers in nanoseconds with remarkably good fraud protection the last thing we need is a new vehicle for nurturing illicit activities and laundering the proceeds which another cryptocurrency will almost certainly turn out to be the real problem with our existing currencies and financial arrangements which serve as a means of payment as well as a store of value is the lack of competition among and regulation of the companies that control transactions as a result consumers especially in the united states pay a multiple of what payments should cost lining the pockets of visa mastercard american express and banks with tens of billions of dollars of rents excessive profits every year the durbin amendment to the 2010 dodd frank financial reform legislation curbs the excessive fees charged for debit cards only to a very limited extent and it did nothing about the much bigger problem of excessive fees associated with credit cards other countries such as australia have done a much better job including by forbidding credit card companies from using contractual provisions to restrain competition whereas the us supreme court in another of its 5 4 decisions seemed to turn a blind eye to such provisions anti competitive effects but even if the us decides to have a non competitive second rate financial system europe and the rest of the world should say no it is not anti american to be pro competition as trump seems to have recently suggested in his criticism of european commissioner for competition margrethe vestager one might well ask what is facebook s business model and why do so many seem so interested in its new venture it could be that they want a cut of the rents accruing to the platforms through which transactions are processed the fact that they believe that more competition won t drive down profits to near zero attests to the corporate sector s confidence in its ability to wield market power and in its political power to ensure that government won t intervene to curb these excesses with the us supreme court s renewed commitment to undermining american democracy facebook and its friends might think they have little to fear but regulators entrusted not just with maintaining stability but also with ensuring competition in the financial sector should step in and elsewhere in the world there is less enthusiasm for america s tech dominance with its anti competitive practices supposedly the new libra currency s value will be fixed in terms of a global basket of currencies and 100 backed presumably by a mix of government treasuries so here s another possible source of revenue paying no interest on deposits traditional currencies exchanged for libra facebook can reap an arbitrage profit from the interest it receives on those deposits but why would anyone give facebook a zero interest deposit when they could put their money in an even safer us treasury bill or in a money market fund the recording of capital gains and losses each time a transaction occurs as the libra is converted back into local currency and the taxes due seem to be an important impediment unless facebook believes it can ride roughshod over our tax system as it has over privacy and competition concerns there are two obvious answers to the question of the business model one is that people who engage in nefarious activities possibly including america s current president are willing to pay a pretty penny to have their nefarious activities corruption tax avoidance drug dealing or terrorism go undetected but having made so much progress in impeding the use of the financial system to facilitate crime why would anyone let alone the government or financial regulators condone such a tool simply because it bears the label tech if this is libra s business model governments should shut it down immediately at the very least libra should be subject to the same transparency regulations that apply to the rest of the financial sector but then it wouldn t be a cryptocurrency alternatively the data libra transactions provide could be mined like all the other data that s come into facebook s possession reinforcing its market power and profits and further undermining our security and privacy facebook or libra might promise not to do that but who would believe it then there is the broader question of trust every currency is based on confidence that the hard earned money deposited into it will be redeemable on demand the private banking sector has long shown that it is untrustworthy in this respect which is why new prudential regulations have been necessary but in just a few short years facebook has earned a level of distrust that took the banking sector much longer to achieve time and again facebook s leaders faced with a choice between money and honouring their promises have grabbed the money and nothing could be more about money than creating a new currency only a fool would trust facebook with his or her financial well being but maybe that s the point with so much personal data on some 2 4 billion monthly active users who knows better than facebook just how many suckers are born every minute bm
when it secured independence in 1948 south korea was wracked by poverty political chaos and popular discontent it was widely regarded as a sinkhole of us aid now this small ruggedly anti communist country enjoys relative political stability making impressive economic progress it has become one of the success stories of the us assistance program experts familiar with south korea s history since its war with the communist north insist that the ingredients for success had been there for a long time however they are convinced that the apparent miracle is genuine and most likely to continue economic growth was at the rate of 7 6 per cent annually over the 1962 67 period with an 8 4 per cent rise in 1967 and a surprising 13 1 per cent in 1968 but it started from a very low base south korea s mixed economy is ranked 11th nominally and 13th largest gdp worldwide in purchasing power parity ppp terms identifying it as one of the g 20 major economies it is a developed country with a high income economy and the most industrialised member country of the oecd south korean brands such as lg electronics and samsung are internationally famous and have garnered a reputation for the country s quality electronics and other manufactured goods although considerable progress has been made toward democracy the overriding need for stability and order and the government s vigilant anti communist policy lays a heavy hand across certain sectors of the society however the key element is a new feeling of self reliance and self assurance that has begun to pervade the country we can do it ourselves has become the motto for a people who were inclined to ask for long how can we ever succeed from 1961 to 1996 south korea underwent a period of rapid economic development during which it transformed into a prosperous industrial society during these years its economic growth rates were among the highest in the world the state gave priority to economic development focusing on a combination of state planning and private entrepreneurship with few natural resources it depended on a low wage educated and disciplined labour force to produce goods for exports as wages rose economic development shifted from labour to capital intensive industries focusing initially on textiles and footwear south korean manufacturing moved to steel heavy equipment ships and petrochemicals in the 1970s and electronics and automobiles in the 1980s two major reforms under the administration of syngman rhee helped prepare the way for land reforms and educational development however it was the commitment to rapid industrialization that set the country off industrialisation was characterised by a close pattern of cooperation between the state and large family owned conglomerates known as chaeb ls but after 1987 labour emerged as a major political force rising wages gave further impetus to the development of a more capital intensive industry although living standards still lagged behind those of north america western europe and japan the gap was significantly narrowed after 1996 its economic development slowed but was still high enough to achieve a per capita income comparable to the countries of western europe and to shift from a borrower of technology to an innovator in technology south koreans attribute much of their success to traditional values by this they mean hard work discipline respect for learning frugality the importance of family emphasis on education high esteem in which civil servants were held that attracted talented technocrats to serve the state and be willing to delay gratification all this has resulted in a high savings rate characterised the period of rapid economic growth many scholars found it necessary to look at specific developmental policies and historical contingencies to explain the economic transformation of south korea including the roles played by land reform educational development and the ways by which the country achieved technical transfers on the other side almost all financial indicators in pakistan have seen a downward trend the growth rate fell by almost 50 per cent from 6 2 per cent to 3 3 per cent south koreans attribute much of their success to traditional values it is expected to go down even further to 2 4 per cent next year the country s lowest in the past 10 years the pakistani rupee has lost a fifth of its value against the dollar since the beginning of this fiscal year inflation is expected to hover around 13 per cent over the next 12 months reaching a 10 year high as well then there is the issue of the ever increasing debt which eats up some 30 per cent of the budget every year pakistan continues to take out loans to be able to cover repayments of past borrowing it recently signed yet another deal with the international monetary fund imf for a bailout package worth 6 billion the country has low sources of revenue and high non development expenditures a recipe for a financial disaster for decades pakistani authorities have been unable to establish effective tax collection practices currently only one per cent of pakistanis pay taxes and the country has one of the lowest tax to gdp ratios in the world successive governments have avoided imposing stricter controls because of widespread corruption in fact it is cheaper for them to bribe than to pay their dues thus the tax burden in pakistan falls overwhelmingly on the poor who pay it in various indirect ways despite already struggling to make ends meet currently a third of the nation is living below the poverty line pakistan may follow the footsteps of south korea in technology and industrialisation now those in power and those who enjoy economic privileges must realise that this status quo is unsustainable the only way out is to implement a just easy tax system along with cancellation of large currency notes like thousand and five thousand if pakistan is to avoid the looming economic disaster it must revise current spending and prioritise expenditures that will actually generate social and economic development and uplift the poor not just the civilian and military elites the writer is an author analyst

new york july 2 2019 prnewswire the u s dollar will likely weaken over time against the chinese yuan as a result of the trade war between the two nations and it may take years before they reach a comprehensive trade deal said kuniyuki hirai managing director and head of trading in the americas for mitsubishi ufj financial group mufg inc kuniyuki hirai mr hirai delivered his comments to financial journalists at a recent session of mufg explores an issues based media series featuring mufg subject matter experts at the bank s new york offices on june 20 he based them in part on the parallels between the current dispute and that of the u s japan trade conflict of the 1980s and 1990s mr hirai stated that the greenback s value would probably decline versus the yuan in the foreseeable future despite the prospect of china s economy suffering more than america s as the trade dispute lingers he believes that if the chinese economy weakens during the current trade dispute as significantly as japan s economy during the u s japan clash china could pull back from its investments abroad including those in the u s such a retreat resulting in a massive selling of dollars and its potential conversion to chinese currency could strengthen the yuan s value versus the dollar mr hirai said he also expects it will take years before the u s and china reach a comprehensive trade deal he points to the u s japan trade row which lasted more than a decade during a time when japan was the world s second largest economy china currently boasts the no 2 economy in the world behind the u s trade wars are typically protracted especially if they occur between trading partners that are the world s largest and second largest economies said mr hirai they also tend to be complex wide in scope and driven not just by trade but also by industrial policy domestic politics geopolitics and intellectual property disputes periodic negotiations and agreements on matters such as tariffs would be positive developments in the interim as we ve seen in the progress made at the recent g20 summit but a comprehensive accord may still take time to achieve mr hirai added a weaker dollar preferred citing the plaza accord of 1985 in which the u s and four other nations agreed to jointly weaken the dollar as a result of the u s japan trade war mr hirai said in the decade following the accord the dollar depreciated nearly 70 against the yen a similar currency agreement between the u s and china could lift the yuan to its highest level vs the dollar in more than five years mr hirai noted that china s economy has shifted its emphasis from growth driven by exports in which a weaker yuan would be advantageous to growth led by domestic consumption whereby a stronger yuan would make imports cheaper china has an interest in not letting the yuan weaken too much against the dollar he said the u s shares that preference as a weaker dollar makes american exports to china more

us manufacturing activity slowed to near a three year low in june with a measure of new orders received by factories tumbling amid growing anxiety over an escalation in trade tensions between the united states and china other data on monday showed construction spending unexpectedly fell in may as investment in private construction projects dropped to its lowest level in nearly two and a half years the reports were the latest indications that economic growth slowed in the second quarter after getting a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory while the slowdown in factory activity was not as steep as had been flagged by some regional factory surveys a sharp drop in a gauge of prices paid by manufacturers could be yet another reason for the federal reserve to consider cutting interest rates this month the us central bank last month signalled it could ease monetary policy as early as this month citing low inflation and growing risks to the economy from us china trade tensions manufacturing is clearly taking it on the chin from the rising trade uncertainty said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york the institute for supply management ism said its index of national factory activity dropped to 51 7 last month the lowest reading since october 2016 from 52 1 in may it was the third straight monthly decline in the index a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector which accounts for about 12 percent of the us economy economists polled by reuters had forecast the ism index would fall to 51 0 in june trade turbulence the ism said businesses expressed concern about us china trade turbulence they were also spooked by potential tariffs on mexican imports which were averted at the eleventh hour the united states bitter trade war with china has hurt business sentiment that together with disruptions to supply chains caused by import tariffs is weighing on manufacturing us president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping on saturday agreed to a trade truce and a return to talks but trump said he was in no hurry to cut a deal and chinese state media warned there was no guarantee an agreement would be reached trump in may raised import tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods prompting beijing to retaliate slowing economy manufacturing is also taking a hit from an inventory overhang which has resulted in businesses placing fewer orders with manufacturers a reduction in the production of boeing s max 737 aircraft which was grounded in march after two fatal plane crashes in five months is also a drag on activity the weakness in factory activity is in sync with a slowdown in economic growth following a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory consumer spending is rising moderately while the pace of job and wage growth has slowed in addition the housing market is struggling and the goods trade deficit widened in may the ism s forward looking new orders sub index decreased 2 7 points to a reading of 50 0 last month the lowest reading since december 2015 a measure of prices paid by manufacturers tumbled 5 3 points to 47 9 computer and electronic products manufacturers complained that china tariffs and pending mexico tariffs are wreaking havoc with supply chains and costs and described the situation as crazy transportation equipment manufacturers said demand for the remainder of 2019 has softened significantly due to issues in the aerospace industry while manufacturers worst fears about an all out trade war with china developing imminently have been allayed uncertainty about the structure of future trading relations continues to linger said sarah house a senior economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte north carolina we suspect factory activity will continue to struggle in the second half of the year improving sentiment however there were some glimmers of hope for manufacturing factories reported hiring more workers which included replacing retiring workers and adding summer help the survey s factory employment gauge rose to 54 5 from 53 7 in may that pointed to a moderate pick up in manufacturing payrolls in june after they were almost flat in may it also suggested an improvement in overall job growth last month after non farm payrolls increased by only 75 000 in may the government is scheduled to publish june s employment report on friday suppliers deliveries are improving while a measure of inventories contracted for the first time since december 2017 with many manufacturers saying they continued to align stocks with softening demand more customers viewed inventories as too low which could lead to some increase in orders stocks on wall street were trading higher with the s p 500 index hitting an all time high as technology stocks gained on a likely reprieve for chinese telecoms company huawei the dollar rose against a basket of currencies but us treasury prices fell also read factory activity shrinks across asia despite the persistent weakness us manufacturing is in relatively better shape compared to the rest of the world reports on monday showed factory activity shrinking across much of europe and asia the ism said 12 industries including machinery computer and electronic products textile mills furniture and electrical equipment appliances and components reported growth last month apparel and transportation equipment were among the five industries reporting a contraction a separate report from the commerce department on monday showed construction spending declined 0 8 per cent in may the biggest drop since last november after rising 0 4 per cent in april construction spending surged in the first quarter boosted by increased investment in roads and highways by state and local governments
president donald trump has long been convinced that the united states is locked in an unfair trading relationship with china the u s has lost 500 billion a year for many years he has said several times in a possible reference to the balance of trade that showed the nation bought 420 billion more goods from china in 2018 than it sold trump has long touted china s huge exports to the u s as a sign that beijing has been taking advantage of american businesses for decades his determination to redress what he sees as an imbalance has resulted in an escalating trade war with stringent tariffs affecting not only the two countries economic outlooks but also the entire global economy and when he sits down with xi jinping on the sidelines of the g 20 summit being held june 28 and 29 in osaka japan all eyes will be on whether they can restart trade talks that collapsed amid a war of words in may while both sides have good economic incentives to return to free trade experts say the two superpowers also have good political reasons to hold firm and back up the tough rhetoric with action on the u s side the mood music was good with treasury secretary steven mnuchin saying wednesday that washington and beijing were almost done with their trade deal whatever happens next the u s china spat threatens to overshadow the meeting of some of the world s leading economies and crucial topics such as climate change and urgent reform of the world trade organization in may trump doubled u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 percent and said he was prepared to slap the same tariff on the remaining 300 billion if there was no progress in talks the effect of this would be huge goldman sachs has warned it would cause global equity markets to fall by 4 percent the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd predicts that renewed tensions between the two countries could see global gross domestic product gdp drop by as much as 0 6 percent the chief economist of the international monetary fund imf gita gopinath said in a blog post in may that the trade war could significantly dent business and financial market sentiment disrupt global supply chains and jeopardize the projected recovery in global growth in 2019 low income households in the u s would be chief among those to suffer from increased prices if the tariff regime was extended she added that s why the mood music coming out of osaka the first official meeting between the two sides in months matters so much why has the dispute become so intense trump spoke so much about u s china trade on the campaign trail in 2015 that a three minute compilation video of him saying china went viral on social media and has since been viewed more than 15 million times a sign for the g 20 summit at a train station in osaka japan tomohiro ohsumi getty images and as promised he has delivered an anti globalization protectionist america first trade agenda billed as a policy that protects u s workers and businesses from unfair chinese practices not everyone believes trump s bold rhetoric will be met by further action there is a real question over whether the u s administration would really be willing to impose all of those i m dubious because this would involve putting tariffs on almost all of the rest of chinese imports said mike jakeman a senior economist at pwc the accountancy and consultancy company in london that would lead to domestic inflation and suddenly you ve got consumers who are quite angry as to why the cost of buying a new iphone has gone up appreciably he said and in an election year when trump has already talked about the economy extensively in his campaign he probably won t want that risk trump s twitter account hails u s economic success on a daily basis from record jobs numbers to stock market highs and it s this economic good fortune that allows him to treat china in terms of foreign policy not just economics jakeman added it s remarkable that trump has gone almost three quarters of the way through his term without really having a difficult decision to make about the economy he has enjoyed a really solid spell that s allowed him to pursue his foreign policy strategy he said national pride as for china the dispute is also about national pride as well as economic success posturing goes both ways and according to james mcgregor an american author journalist and businessman who has lived in china for more than 25 years and is currently chairman of the consulting firm apco worldwide china may have more time to spare despite its domestic economic slowdown the bremen express cargo ship prepares to dock at florida s portmiami which saw china as its top trading country in 2018 joe raedle getty images file i think we have to remember xi jinping does not have to get re elected in 2020 donald trump does and when there s more tariffs coming and they really hit the u s economy and the stock market takes a dive trump will want the stock market to go back up before his election he said so i do think china can be more patient than the u s on this because it s now wrapped up in chinese nationalism very tightly because of huawei he said referring to the huge chinese communications firm that in may was banned from doing business in the u s on whether china is being unfair to u s companies seeking to do business in the country as trump and others allege the picture is more complex the trump administration has made chinese compliance with ip laws a priority for any agreement on reducing or eliminating tariffs between the two countries and it has become a protectionist issue that underscores national pride for both leaders all the more so after trump banned huawei china s leading communications firm from doing business in the u s vicky pryce a former senior u k government economist and now a board member at the centre for economics and business research a london based consultancy said that while american consumers would ultimately be the ones to pay the price for higher tariffs the u s had been justified in taking china to task on various fronts president donald trump greets china s president xi jinping during a business leaders event at the great hall of the people in beijing on nov 8 2017 nicolas asfouri afp getty images file for one thing the government helps chinese companies in a variety of ways such as widespread hidden subsidies she said china has been opening up and so on but it has used all sorts of tricks that make it hard for anyone to see if they have been dumping goods and so on she said you can t say whether in an economic sense it s been wrong but the question is whether you go about it this way the issue of ip theft has long been a bone of contention for trump and for american businesses one third of whom say chinese firms have stolen from them at some point in the past decade at a cost of between 225 billion and 600 billion annually according to the office of the u s trade representative china needs to step up efforts in reform and opening up and carry out more policies in respecting and treating foreign companies and chinese companies as equal to create a better business environment said wei jianguo a former vice minister of commerce and the vice president of china international economic exchange center a government think tank the escalation of tariffs comes as the global economy faces the possibility of a downturn after picking up in 2016 and 2017 with investment and manufacturing stagnating economists generally define a global recession as when growth falls below 2 percent the imf is forecasting 3 6 percent for 2020 which is out of the danger zone but significantly below the 4 percent seen in 2017 so an economic cease fire between the two sides could be a much needed boost if there is suddenly a resolution of the trade problem then you could see a very substantial improvement pryce said i don t think it s a very happy environment at the moment

expert observer the past financial year saw a roller coaster ride for investors share markets plunged into christmas only to rebound over the last six months this note reviews the last financial year and takes a look at the investment outlook for 2019 20 a volatile but good year for diversified investors the past financial year saw pretty good returns for investors but it didn t feel so good around christmas as a combination of worries president trump s trade war with china a slowdown in china fed rate hikes an end to quantitative easing in the eurozone falling property prices and election fears in australia saw share markets fall sharply in fact from its september high to christmas eve us shares plunged 20 but in the last six months share markets have rebounded as while the trade threat has run hot and cold and tensions in the middle east have escalated central banks have turned dovish with many either easing like the rba and pboc or signalling that monetary easing is likely such as the fed and ecb this has seen global share markets rebound sharply with australian shares having their best june half since the early 1990s helped along by the return of the coalition government so for the financial year as a whole global shares returned 6 6 in local currency terms and thanks to a fall in the australian dollar they returned 12 in australian dollar terms australian shares returned 11 6 touching an 11 year high cash and bank deposits had poor returns not helped by the rba cutting the cash rate to a new record low in june but bonds had a spectacular turnaround as rising bond yields on the back of fed tightening a year ago gave way to plunging yields to record lows in many countries as inflation subsided and central banks turned dovish resulting in australian bonds returning 9 6 the plunge in bond yields reinvigorated the search for yield and so helped yield sensitive listed property and infrastructure have strong returns unlisted property and infrastructure continued to do well despite a rougher ride for retail property balanced growth superannuation funds are estimated to have returned around 7 after taxes and fees for the last five years their returns have averaged around 7 4 pa which is not bad given sub 2 inflation australian residential property fared poorly though with average capital city prices down 8 but signs of stabilisation have emerged recently helped by the election result and rate cuts key lessons for investors from the last financial year 1 turn down the noise despite the endless predictions of financial disaster it turned out okay again 2 maintain a well diversified portfolio while shares had a rough ride bonds unlisted assets and exposure to foreign currency for australian investors provided some stability 3 cash is still not king while cash and bank deposits provided safe steady returns they remain very low the negatives which will likely constrain returns there are a bunch of threats which are likely to lead to bouts of volatility and constrain returns first president trump s trade war with china and threats against other countries is adversely affecting business confidence and investment trade talks with china have resumed and both sides have a strong incentive to resolve the issue but there is a risk that they may not second global growth indicators are well down from their highs at the start of last year and the yield curve in the us is flashing a recession warning third the risk of conflict with iran has escalated after the us ditched its commitment to the 2015 iran nuclear agreement as roughly 20 of global oil demand flows through the strait of hormuz its disruption would threaten sharply higher oil prices fourth us political risk is likely to ramp up with the debt ceiling needed to be increased around september remember the debt ceiling us ratings downgrade of 2011 and democratic presidential debates highlighting a sharp leftward lurch at a time when the top democrat nominees are polling ahead of trump fifth eurozone risks remains with an increased risk of a no deal brexit which would be a big drag on the uk economy as 46 of its exports go to the eu and a small drag on european growth as 6 of its exports go to the uk more important for the eurozone is the ongoing tensions around the still worsening italian budget deficit finally in australia while house prices are showing signs of being at or near the bottom rising unemployment risks resulting in a negative feedback loop and another leg down which in turn would further weigh on economic growth but a bunch of things should keep returns positive however there are a bunch of positives providing an offset first while global growth indicators are soft there has been a loss of downwards momentum in the eurozone and globally it still looks like the growth slowdowns of 2011 12 and 2015 16 second the fall in global inflation has seen central banks move from tightening to easing to various degrees providing a renewed stimulus to growth this is a big difference to a year ago when it was thought that the hurdle for central bank easing was high third while the us yield curve is flashing red it s not always reliable it may be distorted by central bank quantitative easing and it has long lead times what s more there is still little sign of the sort of excess that normally precedes recessions there is still spare capacity globally growth in private debt remains moderate investment as a share of gdp is around average or below wages growth and inflation remain low and we are yet to see a generalised euphoria in asset prices the current growth slowdown globally maybe seen as extending the investment cycle by delaying the build up of recession driving excesses fourth while trump s trade wars and maximum pressure on iran may reflect the pursuit of international relevance at a time when his ability to do anything in the us is constrained having lost congress it is in his interest to resolve both in a non disruptive way as american s don t re elect presidents when unemployment is rising and oil prices are surging fifth share valuations are not excessive while price to earnings ratios are moderately above long term averages in developed countries this is to be expected in a world of low inflation valuation measures that allow for low interest rates and bond yields show shares to be fair value or cheap finally while unemployment is expected rise to 5 5 this year in australia it should be limited as infrastructure spending remains strong mining investment bottoms out export demand holds up with overall growth helped by monetary and fiscal stimulus and the low australian dollar what about the return outlook the threats around trade and geopolitical risks along with the tendency for seasonal weakness out to september october could see a pull back in share markets and returns are likely to be constrained but easy money and the absence of large scale economic excess should help extend the cycle and keep returns positive at around 6 over the next 12 months from a well diversified portfolio looking at the major asset classes cash and bank deposit returns are likely to be poor at around 1 as the rba is expected to cut the cash rate to 0 5 by early next year investors still need to think about what they really want if it s capital stability then stick with cash but if it s a decent stable income flow then consider the alternatives with australian shares and unlisted commercial property and infrastructure still offering attractive yields sovereign bond investors benefit from falling yields but once they stop falling expect returns to slow again as yields are now very low bonds are good portfolio diversifiers though listed and unlisted commercial property and infrastructure are likely to benefit from the ongoing search for yield and okay economic growth residential property still has a bit more short term downside risk but expect flattish prices through calendar 2020 as an upwards drift in unemployment constrains returns shares are at risk of a correction into the seasonally weak september october period but okay valuations reasonable economic growth and profits and even easier monetary conditions should see the broad trend in shares remain up finally the a is likely to fall to around us0 65 by year end as the rba eases but with significant short positions the fed easing too and the sharp 39 a fall already seen since 2011 it has become a closer call things to keep an eye on global business conditions pmis for any deeper slowing the trade war this needs to be resolved soon middle east tensions around iran us political risks risks around chinese growth and australian unemployment and house prices conclusion returns are likely to be okay over 2019 20 as conditions are not in place for recession but expect constrained returns say around 6 for a diversified fund and bouts of volatility shane oliver is the head of investment strategy and chief economist at amp capital
tokyo july 2 the dollar gave up gains today as investors curbed earlier enthusiasm about us china trade progress while the australian currency barely budged from recent lows after a central bank rate cut decision offered few clues about future easing the yuan also shed its early rise to trade lower on the day after us president donald trump said any deal with china would need to be somewhat tilted in favour of the united states suggesting negotiations may not proceed smoothly the us dollar index against a basket of six major currencies earlier rose to its highest in a week but retreated as doubt set in about the resumption of us china efforts to resolve their trade war market focus now shifts to reserve bank of australia governor philip lowe who speaks to business leaders in the northern australian city of darwin at 0930 gmt which could provide clues on how much further interest rates could fall advertisement the tone from the rba was not that pessimistic which gives the impression they are somewhat reluctant to cut rates further said yukio ishizuki foreign exchange strategist at daiwa securities in tokyo short positions in the aussie were already so heavy now we re in a situation where the main risk is for the aussie to be bought back the australian dollar was up 0 3 per cent at us 0 6983 rm2 8893 today after slumping 0 9 per cent yesterday its biggest decline since april 24 advertisement the rba lowered interest rates by 25 basis points to a record low of 1 00 per cent matching economists expectations in a statement the central said it would lower rates again if needed a phrase some analysts took to mean an additional rate cut is less certain than before the us dollar index was little changed at 96 790 today having posted its biggest increase since march 7 yesterday on hopes beijing and washington were making headway in their trade negotiations the united states and china have already imposed tariffs of up to 25 per cent on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other s goods in a dispute about china s trade practices that has lasted nearly a year the drawn out trade war has slowed global growth and pushed many central banks to cut interest rates to support their economies the offshore yuan gave up early gains to trade around 0 2 per cent lower at 6 8690 versus the dollar on course for its biggest daily decline in a week the global investor spotlight will move to us non farm payrolls data due on friday which economists expect to have risen by 160 000 in june compared with a 75 000 increase in may however analysts expect the dollar will struggle to make substantial gains given expectations the federal reserve will cut rates due to low inflation and worries about the us china trade war it would be a mistake to view the rise in the dollar on monday as the beginning of a broad based rally said junichi ishikawa senior foreign exchange strategist at ig securities in tokyo treasury yields are capped around 2 per cent because there are still expectations for fed rate cuts the euro briefly fell to an eight day low of us 1 1275 before trading little changed at us 1 1289 the common currency fell 0 7 per cent yesterday its biggest one day decline since march as disappointing economic data triggered a tumble in bond yields and boosted expectations for a european central bank rate cut reuters
on tuesday european officials nominated christine lagarde the international monetary fund s current leader to succeed mario draghi as european central bank president here s a primer on the institution lagarde has been chosen to lead what is the european central bank the european central bank which has its headquarters in frankfurt germany sets monetary policy and supervises banking for the 19 countries that use the common european currency the euro in many ways it operates much like the federal reserve in the united states printing money setting benchmark interest rates and encouraging people to spend or save depending on the needs of the region s economy a key element of its job is to maintain price stability and keep inflation in check across a swath of europe that stretches from the nordic nations to the mediterranean how big is the eurozone economy and which countries participate in it if the eurozone were a country it would have the world s second largest economy after the united states its 19 member states account for 340 million people membership is open meaning that if other european union countries wanted to join and met the relevant criteria they could the current members are austria belgium cyprus estonia finland france germany greece ireland italy latvia lithuania luxembourg malta the netherlands portugal slovakia slovenia and spain what was the central bank s role in the eurozone debt crisis as an economic malaise in greece and other european countries threatened the euro s future in 2012 draghi said he would do whatever it takes to save the currency that pronouncement established the ecb s commitment to preserving the euro a significant moment for the bloc and for the global economy as part of its rescue effort the central bank started pumping huge numbers of euros into the region s economy in a program similar to the so called quantitative easing employed by the fed by the end of 2018 european policymakers had spent 2 trillion about 2 25 trillion in such stimulus many people said the initiative known as outright monetary transactions effectively saved the euro some of the region s richer countries opposed and mounted legal challenges to the program over what they complained were backdoor subsidies but the central bank persevered as a result it bolstered its status by establishing itself as a lender of last resort in the common currency area how will the bank approach future financial challenges the ecb s role as a supervisor of all eurozone banks will almost certainly be pivotal if the global financial system faces another crisis the central bank will play an especially critical role should there be a downturn in the global or european economies that chips away at the value of the region s banks assets and makes their own borrowing and lending more expensive lagarde has deep experience managing a major multilateral lender the international monetary fund which she has led since 2011 advised countries on the handling of their banking sectors in the aftermath of the global financial and eurozone crises the ecb may have to come to the rescue for instance if italy s troubled economy the eurozone s third largest encounters more problems as its government continues to spend beyond its means and accumulate debt lagarde s performance during the eurozone crisis when the monetary fund teamed up with the ecb and the european commission to bail out troubled countries will come in handy but it could also hamper her efforts given that officials in some of those countries still resent the hawkish stance she took toward their struggles
hannah moore poses for a portrait in los angeles on june 26 moore has struggled to save since graduating from college in december 2007 the same month the great recession officially began she has worked nearly continuously since then despite a couple of layoffs ap photo marcio jose sanchez by christopher rugaber associated press washington as it enters its 11th year america s economic expansion is now the longest on record a streak that has shrunk unemployment swelled household wealth revived the housing market and helped fuel an explosive rise in the stock market yet even after a full decade of uninterrupted economic growth the richest americans now hold a greater share of the nation s wealth than they did before the great recession began in 2007 and income growth has been sluggish by historical standards leaving many americans feeling stuck in place those trends help explain something unique about this expansion it s easily the least celebrated economic recovery in decades as public discontent has grown the issue has become one for political candidates to harness beginning with donald trump in 2016 now some of the democrats running to challenge trump for the presidency have built their campaigns around proposals to tax wealth raise minimum wages or ease the financial strain of medical care and higher education america s financial disparities have widened in large part because the means by which people build wealth have become more exclusive since the great recession fewer middle class americans own homes fewer are invested in the stock market and home prices have risen far more in wealthier metro areas on the coasts than in more modestly priced cities and rural areas the result is that affluent homeowners now sit on vast sums of home equity and capital gains while tens of millions of ordinary households have been left mainly on the sidelines the recovery has been very disappointing from the standpoint of inequality said gabriel zucman an economist at the university of california berkeley and a leading expert on income and wealth distribution household wealth the value of homes stock portfolios and bank accounts minus mortgage and credit card debt and other loans jumped 80 in the past decade more than one third of that gain 16 2 trillion in riches went to the wealthiest 1 figures from the federal reserve show just 25 of it went to middle to upper middle class households the bottom half of the population gained less than 2 nearly 8 million americans lost homes in the recession and its aftermath and the sharp price gains since then have put ownership out of reach for many would be buyers for america s middle class the homeownership rate fell to about 60 in 2016 from roughly 70 in 2004 before the housing bubble according to separate fed data the other major engine of household wealth the stock market hasn t much benefited most people either the longest bull market in u s history which surpassed its own 10 year mark in march has shot equity prices up more than four fold yet the proportion of middle income households that own shares has actually declined the fed calculates that about half of middle income americans owned shares in 2016 the most recent year for which data is available down from 56 in 2007 that includes people who hold stocks in retirement accounts the decline in stock market participation occurred mainly because more middle income workers took contract work or other jobs that offered no retirement savings plans the fed concluded hannah moore now 37 has struggled to save since graduating from college in december 2007 the same month the great recession officially began she has worked nearly continuously since then despite a couple of layoffs i had many jobs all at the same time she said it s just not been the easiest of decades if you re trying to jump start a career she works for a design firm in los angeles that contracts with luxury apartment developers that build rental housing marketed to high tech employees she loves the work but she struggles with los angeles high costs moore says she could afford a monthly mortgage payment but she lacks the savings for a down payment about half her income she calculates is eaten up by rent health insurance and student loan payments of 850 a month as financial inequalities have widened over the past decade racial disparities in wealth have worsened too the typical wealth for a white household is 171 000 nearly 10 times that for african americans that s up from seven times before the housing bubble and it primarily reflects sharp losses in housing wealth for blacks the african american homeownership rate fell to a record low in the first three months of this year most economists argue that higher income growth is needed to make it easier for more americans to save and build wealth zucman favors a higher minimum wage cheaper access to college education and more family friendly policies to enable more parents to work he and his colleague emmanuel saez also an economist at the university of california berkeley helped formulate sen elizabeth warren s proposed wealth tax on fortunes above 50 million to help pay for those proposals income growth has lagged partly because for most of the expansion employers have had a surfeit of workers to choose among when filling jobs leaving them little pressure to raise pay not until 2016 did the unemployment rate fall below 5 average hourly pay finally began to pick up with the lowest income workers receiving the fastest average gains overall there s growing inequality elise gould an economist at the liberal economic policy institute said with signs of hope at the bottom it s just taken a very long time

back in april i made the argument that the swiss franc had reached a bottom and we could expect the currency to rise from here in the past month we see that the swiss franc has seen significant growth against the greenback outpacing even that of the japanese yen source dailyfx com the main reasons that i had hypothesised the franc to grow significantly were potential overheating of the swiss property market necessitating a rate hike the currency has shown significant strength against the euro in spite of negative rates growth in the currency is being driven by risk off sentiment rather than interest rates the swiss franc and the yen to an extent have been pushed up on reports that the federal reserve is getting ready to cut interest rates however developments appear to be afoot as regards us china trade talks and with president trump anticipated to suspend the next round of tariffs and reversing the ban on huawei the u s dollar has rallied and the swiss franc has seen a sudden reversal in growth source dailyfx com that said it remains to be seen whether the boost in risk on sentiment is temporary or whether this could in fact be a good time to buy the swiss franc on weakness personally i see it as unlikely that the news on china will significantly change the federal reserveâ s view on the economy just recently mortgage rates in the united states hit the lowest level in 31 months highlighting that the housing market in the u s is still on shaky ground and rate cuts are still on the table if necessary to stimulate growth as for where this leaves the swiss franc the currency will still be driven largely by sentiment as a safe haven currency the chf is not particularly influenced by domestic interest rates and will continue to appreciate for as long as risk off sentiment continues moreover with the ecb proposing to ease policy further to boost inflation in the euro zone this is likely to place further upward pressure on the franc going forward additionally we see that the chf eur is still trading significantly below the 0 94 level that we saw at the beginning of 2017 should we see further weakness in the euro then it is quite possible that the currency could hit this level by the end of this year source dailyfx com ultimately i continue to take a bullish view on the swiss franc and expect to see further upside

london ap â global stock markets traded in fairly narrow ranges tuesday as investors moved on from the latest truce in the costly u s chinese trade war investors were encouraged monday by the agreement between presidents donald trump and xi jinping of china at a weekend meeting of the group of 20 major economies to resume trade negotiations forecasters warned however the two sides still face the same differences that caused talks to break down in may the trump administration has also ratcheted up tensions with the european union by proposing additional tariffs on 4 billion of european imports in a dispute over subsidies to aircraft manufacturers yesterday s optimism in equity markets is beginning to look a little over eager with some already drawing worrying parallels to the november 2018 g 20 summit which was followed up by a dramatic fall for equities said chris beauchamp chief market analyst at ig the past is not prologue and the central bank outlook is very different to the end of 2018 as easing comes back on to the agenda but with volumes drying up ahead of independence day and the next earnings season rapidly approaching equities are looking vulnerable to some near term weakness in europe london s ftse 100 rose 0 5 to 7 536 germany s dax was flat at 12 519 while france s cac 40 was steady at 5 570 advertisement advertisement on wall street the futures for the standard poor s 500 index and dow jones industrial average were both down 0 1 earlier in asia tokyo s nikkei 225 gained 0 1 to 21 754 27 hong kong s hang seng added 1 2 to 28 875 56 after the latest bout of political protests was quelled with relatively little violence the shanghai composite index was off 1 point at 3 043 94 and seoul s kospi shed 0 4 to 2 122 02 story continues australia rate cut australia s central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a record low 1 in a bid to stimulate economic activity it was the second cut in two months after the reserve bank of australia had held steady for three years the central bank governor philip lowe said the cut will will support employment growth lowe said uncertainty generated by the trade and technology disputes was affecting investment energy in the oil markets traders were digesting the news that opec members won the support of other major oil producing nations to extend a production cut for another nine months in a bid to shore up prices at a time of waning demand given that the decision was widely anticipated there was barely any move in markets benchmark u s crude fell 79 cents to 58 30 per barrel in electronic trading on the new york mercantile exchange while brent crude used to price international oils slipped 37 cents to 64 33 per barrel currency the euro was up 0 1 percent at 1 1297 while the dollar fell 0 3 percent to 108 14 yen
the once obscure school of macroeconomic thought known as modern monetary theory has been attracting a lot of attention lately some us progressives such as representative alexandria ocasio cortez aoc and economists like james k galbraith now advocate including mmt in the policy conversation while others including kenneth rogoff dismiss it as problematic and even dangerous building on abba lerner s theory of functional finance mmt essentially argues that countries that issue their own currencies can never run out of money in the way private businesses can for us progressives like aoc and presidential candidate bernie sanders this implies that the federal reserve could print large amounts of money to fund initiatives with major long term benefits such as a job guarantee program or public infrastructure projects because the united states can borrow in its own currency the logic goes the surge in public sector debt would not pose any real danger to the economy some mmt advocates including stephanie kelton a former economic adviser to sanders point to japan as proof that the approach works despite high public debt its economy is steadily recovering and standards of living are high moreover mmt advocates point out japan s expansionary monetary policies a central feature of prime minister shinzo abe s economic revitalization strategy abenomics have not generated a much feared surge in inflation even within japan some argue that there is no need for a consumption tax hike to fund public spending but there is a serious problem with this logic japan s government is not as heavily indebted as is generally believed though japan s gross debt to gdp ratio at 240 is the highest in the developed world what really matters for the government just like for private firms is the net debt to gdp ratio which accounts for real and financial assets and japan s public companies have very large real assets in fact by this measure japan is about on par with the us and doing much better than france and germany according to the international monetary fund s october 2018 fiscal monitor report managing public wealth further challenging kelton s assessment japan s primary balance has improved under abenomics thanks to its economic recovery this does not mean that mmt has no merit in japan or elsewhere in its campaign to increase consumption taxes japan s ministry of finance drilled into the public psyche the concept of ricardian equivalence a government cannot stimulate consumer demand with debt financed spending because people assume that whatever is gained now will be offset by higher taxes due in the future it was this campaign that drove the mof constantly to advertise the 240 figure mmt can challenge this strict ricardian belief drawing attention to the potential of deficit financing say to boost employment through targeted social spending and indeed olivier blanchard and takeshi tashiro have already proposed using limited deficit financing to help bring japan s interest rates up to zero at a time when the government s borrowing costs are low and the effectiveness of monetary policy is weak implementing such a policy successfully however would demand careful attention to inflationary risks the current deflationary phase will not last forever eventually supply constraints will be reached and inflation will return if the government has been engaging in excessive deficit financed spending once inflation is triggered it could quickly spin out of control mmt lacks any safeguard against that outcome unlike for example the fiscal theory of the price level which expressly counts on an independent central bank to manage inflation in fact supplying money with a constant nominal interest rate as mmt seems to prescribe would be the worst thing to do during an inflationary period because the nominal market interest rate would probably be higher than the policy rate when discussing mmt i cannot help but recall goethe s poem the sorcerer s apprentice the sorcerer leaves his apprentice alone to carry out his chores rather than perform his duties as expected the apprentice decides to use the sorcerer s magic commanding a broom to carry buckets of water to fill a cauldron it helps for a while in fact for quite a long time but eventually the cauldron begins to overflow flooding the room and the apprentice cannot get the broom to stop adding more water when he splits the broom with an axe each piece becomes a new one fetching water at twice the speed just short of catastrophe the sorcerer returns and sets the situation right policymakers who recklessly implement mmt may find like the sorcerer s apprentice that once the policies are set in motion they will be difficult to stop and while a central bank can with the requisite authority and independence potentially step in to save the day it is no all powerful sorcerer koichi hamada professor emeritus of economics at yale is a special adviser to japan s prime

after possibly the best first half of a year ever for world markets investors now find themselves hoping for a familiar fallback to keep the party going central banks wading in with more stimulus some are even betting the recent wave of pessimism about the global economic outlook is misplaced despite the possibility of a swift end to the newly agreed u s china trade truce and bond markets flashing recession warnings few are optimistic enough to expect as stellar a run for markets as in the first six months of 2019 when global equities soared 15 u s government bonds returned 7 and commodity prices climbed as central banks promised more stimulus and risks abound not least from trade tensions between the world s two biggest economies and elevated share and bond valuations which may tempt investors to sell and book profits potential hazards litter the horizon including federal reserve policy meetings on july 30 31 and september 17 18 and britain s next date to leave the european union on oct 31 mario draghi s eight year term as european central bank chief ends the same day his successor may oversee the reintroduction of quantitative easing before year end but investors addiction to central bank largesse has many believing that the end of a decade long bull run and the longest economic expansion on record will be postponed it s almost like bad news becomes good news said jim leaviss a fixed income fund manager at m g predicting that weak economic data would spur central banks into launching a new round of monetary easing as they have already signaled markets dependency on central bank stimulus has created a disconnect in asset pricing that has dominated 2019 while government bond yields in germany and the united states have plummeted which many investors say is a clear sign of nervousness about the outlook equity markets have soared back towards record levels one of the key themes we ve focused on is that there is misplaced macro pessimism said joseph little chief strategist at hsbc global asset management so if you get anything reasonably constructive in terms of economic news politics corporate profits or the news is not as bad as the market discounts then there is scope for a number of risky assets to perform well in the second half of the year cautious mood while equities are retesting 2019 highs investors have entered the second half of the year in a cautious mood as data points to slowing growth momentum across the world demand for government debt is predicted to remain high goldman sachs said their downside risk scenario for the 10 year german bund the go to safe haven european government bond is to yield around 0 5 it hit a record 0 34 low last week gold too recently surged to a six year high as investors sought hedges against a weakening dollar and falling u s interest rate expectations but investors are hardly panicking yields on junk rated company debt usually shunned during troubled times are near their lowest in over a year down some 2 percentage points since january in a world where an estimated 13 trillion of fixed income assets carry sub 0 yields money managers are likely to continue diversifying into lower rated riskier securities what s more rock bottom volatility swings in prices favors seeking carry a strategy where investors sell lower yield assets to buy higher yielding securities the question for credit investors is are we going to see a significant increase in company default risks said eric brard head of fixed income at amundi asset management we are in a period of slowing growth but we don t expect a recession he told reuters noting yield premiums on investment grade corporate debt were still 40 to 50 basis points away from their tightest levels over underlying benchmarks put to the test the disconnect between buoyant equities and nervous bonds may be explainable if fixed income investors are simply adjusting to lower neutral policy rates in the world s big economies rather than anticipating a major downturn barclays analysts believe just that meaning the stock market move is more consistent with the bond rally others are less sure colin harte head of research for bnp paribas asset management s multi asset solutions team predicts investor faith in central banks will be tested later this year he believes markets current disposition is sustainable only if goldilocks conditions of economic growth without much inflation remain in place the risk is that markets are underplaying the trade war impact and not yet pricing in how a broader retrenchment from the high point of globalization will impact the world economy if that is the case monetary policy won t work he said markets may be quite disappointed source reuters by tommy wilkes additional reporting by dhara ranasinghe and sujata rao editing by catherine evans

as it enters its 11th year america s economic expansion is now the longest on record a streak that has shrunk unemployment swelled household wealth revived the housing market and helped fuel an explosive rise in the stock market yet even after a full decade of uninterrupted economic growth the richest americans now hold a greater share of the nation s wealth than they did before the great recession began in 2007 and income growth has been sluggish by historical standards leaving many americans feeling stuck in place those trends help explain something unique about this expansion it s easily the least celebrated economic recovery in decades as public discontent has grown the issue has become one for political candidates to harness beginning with donald trump in 2016 now some of the democrats running to challenge trump for the presidency have built their campaigns around proposals to tax wealth raise minimum wages or ease the financial strain of medical care and higher education america s financial disparities have widened in large part because the means by which people build wealth have become more exclusive since the great recession fewer middle class americans own homes fewer are invested in the stock market and home prices have risen far more in wealthier metro areas on the coasts than in more modestly priced cities and rural areas the result is that affluent homeowners now sit on vast sums of home equity and capital gains while tens of millions of ordinary households have been left mainly on the sidelines the recovery has been very disappointing from the standpoint of inequality said gabriel zucman an economist at the university of california berkeley and a leading expert on income and wealth distribution household wealth the value of homes stock portfolios and bank accounts minus mortgage and credit card debt and other loans jumped 80 in the past decade more than one third of that gain 16 2 trillion in riches went to the wealthiest 1 figures from the federal reserve show just 25 of it went to middle to upper middle class households the bottom half of the population gained less than 2 nearly 8 million americans lost homes in the recession and its aftermath and the sharp price gains since then have put ownership out of reach for many would be buyers for america s middle class the homeownership rate fell to about 60 in 2016 from roughly 70 in 2004 before the housing bubble according to separate fed data and the sharpest increases occurred in richer cities like san francisco where prices have more than doubled in the past decade or phoenix where they ve surged 80 by contrast in lower cost charlotte home prices have risen by only about a third in cleveland by less than one fifth overall in fact middle income households on average now have less home equity than they did before the recession fed data show the other major engine of household wealth the stock market hasn t much benefited most people either the longest bull market in u s history which surpassed its own 10 year mark in march has shot equity prices up more than four fold yet the proportion of middle income households that own shares has actually declined the fed calculates that about half of middle income americans owned shares in 2016 the most recent year for which data is available down from 56 in 2007 that includes people who hold stocks in retirement accounts the decline in stock market participation occurred mainly because more middle income workers took contract work or other jobs that offered no retirement savings plans the fed concluded in other cases people who face major expenses for say health care or who have heavy student loan debt find it hard to save and invest much even if they do have access to retirement accounts many households find it challenging to make key middle class investments because incomes at the middle are not keeping up with the rising costs of education and homeownership and it is difficult to save enough lael brainard a member of the federal reserve s board of governors said in a speech in may hannah moore now 37 has struggled to save since graduating from college in december 2007 the same month the great recession officially began she has worked nearly continuously since then despite a couple of layoffs moore who studied interior design in chicago at a for profit college began job hunting just as many architecture and design firms were downsizing for several years she did freelance design projects and worked in retail jobs sometimes working 30 days without a day off none provided health insurance or a retirement savings plan i had many jobs all at the same time she said it s just not been the easiest of decades if you re trying to jump start a career her situation stabilized when she found full time work in 2013 three years later she moved to los angeles where she works for a design firm that contracts with luxury apartment developers that build rental housing marketed to high tech employees she loves the work but she struggles with los angeles high costs moore says she could afford a monthly mortgage payment but she lacks the savings for a down payment about half her income she calculates is eaten up by rent health insurance and student loan payments of 850 a month as financial inequalities have widened over the past decade racial disparities in wealth have worsened too the typical wealth for a white household is 171 000 nearly 10 times that for african americans that s up from seven times before the housing bubble and it primarily reflects sharp losses in housing wealth for blacks the african american homeownership rate fell to a record low in the first three months of this year if wealth inequality has worsened because fewer americans own homes and stocks should the government try to reverse that trend president george w bush spoke optimistically in the 2000s about an ownership society the idea was that a larger proportion of americans would achieve prosperity by buying homes and investing in the stock market through retirement savings plans such discussion has faded since the housing bust many economists argue that what s needed is simply higher incomes so more americans can save and build wealth zucman favors a higher minimum wage cheaper access to college education and more family friendly policies to enable more parents to work he and his colleague emmanuel saez also an economist at the university of california berkeley helped formulate sen elizabeth warren s proposed wealth tax on fortunes above 50 million to help pay for those proposals as the wealth gap has widened income gains have remained anemic for americans at all levels for the past decade that is particularly true relative to the sizable pay gains that flowed to households during the robust expansions of the 1980s and 1990s if you compare the economy now to where it was before the recession the most important fact has been its relatively slow growth said jason furman an economist at harvard university and a former top adviser to president barack obama data compiled by zucman saez and thomas piketty show that incomes grew much faster for the top 1 in the 1980s and the 1990s than over the past decade yet inequality has captured much more attention now than it did then in part that may be because middle class and poorer americans haven t enjoyed the fruits of this expansion compared with other recoveries incomes for middle class americans grew nearly twice as fast in the 1980s expansion and about 1 5 times faster in the 1990s than in the current recovery for many people inequality carries less sting when their own fortunes improve the more people are struggling to make ends meet themselves the more they may notice inequality said elise gould an economist at the liberal economic policy institute income growth has lagged partly because for most of the expansion employers have had a surfeit of workers to choose among when filling jobs leaving them little pressure to raise pay not until 2016 did the unemployment rate fall below 5 average hourly pay finally began to pick up with the lowest income workers receiving the fastest average gains though this trend has helped narrow income inequality vast disparities remain overall there s growing inequality gould said with signs of hope at the bottom it s

for the fifth time since the end of 2017 the market hit an all time high each previous all time high has led an almost immediate sell off will this time be different this was the question i asked last tuesday such is the belief currently which is being driven primarily by the pavlovian response of a more accommodative federal reserve which is expected to cut rates sharply by the end of this year it is also the hope there will be a resolution to the ongoing trade war with china at the g 20 summit next week however while the markets rallied on monday on the news of a cease fire as i noted in this past weekend s newsletter nothing has really changed as we suggested previously the most likely outcome was a truceâ but no deal while the markets will likely react positively next week to the news that talks will continue the impact of existing tariffs from both the u s and china continue to weigh on domestic firms and consumers more importantly while the continued jawboning may keep hope alive for investors temporarily these two countries have been talking for over a year with little real progress to show for it outside of superficial agreements importantly we have noted that trump would eventually cave into the pressure from the impact of the trade war he started this was evident in this weekend s agreement by agreeing to continue talks without imposing more tariffs on china china gains ample running room to continue to adjust for current tariffs to lessen their impact more importantly trump gave up a major bargaining chip huawei so yes the market rallied on monday given relief that no new tariffs will be imposed however such does not counteract the negative impact from the existing tariffs which continue to weigh on both producers and consumers secondly the agreement to temporarily put the trade war on hold also takes the pressure off of the federal reserve to cut rates in july if the employment report on friday keeps the unemployment rate at historic lows and shows growth of around 150 000 jobs as is currently expected there is a rising probability the fed will remain on hold this is not what the markets are betting on currently as i noted last week assumptions are always a dangerous thing as markets have a nasty habit of doing exactly the opposite of what the masses expect nonetheless the market rally on monday was expected and followed along with bofa s recent analysis of these 4 two are most remarkable the best best and the worst worst cases the first one sees a dovish fed statement coupled with a g 20 deal which according to bofa will send the s p 3000 and the 10y yield to 2 00 while the worst possible outcome would be if there is a 1 a hawkish fed surprise and 2 no deal at the g 20 which would send the s p below 2 650 or potentially resulting in a 12 drop in the market while sending 10y yields to 1 50 and pushing gold above its 5 year breakout zone as the vix surges hartnett was correct in his outlook with the best possible of outcomes still a sellable rally while the current breakout to new highs is indeed bullish it is important to note the entirety of the june rally which was proclaimed the best in 80 years barely recouped what was lost in just the month of may importantly the market which was deeply oversold at the beginning of june and formed the basis of our sellable rally call is now back to extremely overbought such suggests limited upside from current levels the chart below shows that previous test of multiple support levels and the rally back to overhead resistance which we are once again challenging as noted previously while there is a rush to bid up equities due to recent talk from the white house and the fed the reality is that nothing has really changed a trade deal wasn t reached and china will continue to refuse to give in to demands for economic reform additional tariffs are coming by the end of the summer existing tariffs which were just ratcheted up at the beginning of june have not been fully recognized in the economy as of yet more pain is coming by the end of the summer while the markets think that trump has the upper hand it is china for now they can hold out to economic pressures far longer than trump as xi is not facing re election china knows this the fed has now started to recognize their independence has been threatened look to powell to flex his muscles a bit in july and not cut rates particularly if the june jobs report is moderately strong the fed is still reducing its balance sheet the point is there are more than a few outcomes which could disappoint the financial markets and why this remains a sellable rally for now but aside from the technical underpinnings which remain moderately unfavorable for higher highs currently there is also a deteriorating fundamental backdrop negative earnings guidance i have been noting for the last several quarters the consistent and large decline in forward earnings expectations from our last analysis as of the end of the q4 2018 reporting period guess where we are exactly 11 lower than where we started which as stated then has effectively wiped out all the benefit from the tax cuts importantly the estimates for the end of 2019 are still too high and will need to revised lower over the next couple of quarters as economic growth remains materially weaker the burgeoning debts and deficits corporate and household leverage and slower job growth will ensure slower growth into year end that expected reduction in both 2019 and 2020 estimates is underway as john butters of factset recently penned heading into the end of the second quarter 113 s p 500 companies have issued eps guidance for the quarter of these 113 companies 87 have issued negative eps guidance and 26 companies have issued positive eps guidance the number of companies issuing negative eps for q2 is above the five year average of 74 in fact if 87 is the final number for the second quarter it will mark the second highest number of s p 500 companies issuing negative eps guidance for a quarter since factset began tracking this data in 2006 trailing only q1 2016 at 92 what is driving the unusually high number of s p 500 companies issuing negative eps guidance for the second quarter at the sector level seven of the 11 sectors have seen more companies issue negative eps guidance for q2 2019 relative to their five year averages however the information technology and health care sectors are the largest contributors to the overall increase in the number of s p 500 companies issuing negative eps guidance for q2 relative to the five year average why is this happening it s the economy stupid as economic growth slows companies have to begin to adjust for lower levels of consumption this initially shows up in things that under the immediate control of corporate decision makers like unspent capital investment it s easy to shelve a project or development that money was committed to but not yet spent as chetan ahya morgan stanley chief economist recently stated via zerohedge â it was clear that the global capex cycle had ground to a halt capital goods imports a capex proxy began their descent in mid 2018 when trade tensions first re emerged in july 2018 they were tracking at 18 y on a three month moving average basis but plummeted to 2 y in january 2019 and an estimated 3 y in may 2019 in aggregate private fixed capital formation investments in fixed assets in the g4 and bric economies fell from a peak of 4 7 y in 1q18 to just 2 8 y in 1q19 the next decline occurs in how companies frame their outlook are they more optimistic or less corporate sentiment has also declined to multi year lows global pmis for may fell in broad based fashion with only about one third of the countries we track reporting a pmi above the 50 expansion threshold in the us our morgan stanley business conditions index recorded its largest one month decline ever plunging to a level not seen since june 2008 other business sentiment gauges such as the regional fed and german ifo and zew surveys for the month of june paint a fairly bleak picture too what s more consumer sentiment is also starting to sour with the conference board s consumer confidence index for june falling to the lowest point since september 2017 but with stock prices at all time highs why worry about these risks a key reason why we worry about downside risks is that the adverse impact of trade tensions is non linear as earnings growth slows and uncertainty and costs rise the levered corporate sector will face tightening financial conditions given higher corporate leverage this will probably be most pronounced in the us particularly for companies with weaker balance sheets defaults could accelerate bringing corporate credit risks to the fore thus amplifying the initial trade shock with even tighter financial conditions which could impair lending weaken confidence further and exacerbate the slowdown in growth rekindling animal spirits will not be easy the last sign these are not trivial issues for investors while the market will be focused on the employment number on friday this is probably one of the worst indicators to look at due to its lag to the rest of the important fundamental and economic factors why because companies are last to hire last to fire employees are expensive to hire train and maintain good talent is extremely hard to replace so companies are slow to hire due to the cost and slow to fire because they don t want to give up good talent to potential competitors when unemployment along with jobless claims do begin to tick up that is generally the last sign before a recession sets in however since interest rates are a reflection of underlying economic strength it is not surprising there is a decent relationship between sharp declines in interest rates and employment the chart below is the annual rate of change in both rates and employment don t be surprised to see weaker employment numbers in the months ahead as bloomberg also noted falling bond yields have been the big surprise of 2019 so far and there s an excellent chance they will grind lower in the second half and take stocks with them as weak growth spurs global monetary easing given how tough it has been to forecast bond yields getting that call right for the rest of the year is key a reminder of how difficult that can be comes from san francisco fed president mary daly twice last week she said it s very hard to say what the central bank should do including comments that she s unsure whether interest rates will be lower a year from now surveying the outlooks our team came up with at the start of 2019 it s clear our biggest misses were all in bonds the same goes for those readers who took part in our surveys treasury yields finished june more than 100 bps below the consensus for end 2019 while bunds were 75 bps lower and italian yields a whopping 105 bond analysts were also far too bearish well it hasn t actually been all that difficult to forecast the direction of bonds considering we have been calling for consistently lower rates over the last three years the problem with equities at all time highs with yields and economic growth declining sharply is that it has consistently led to terrible outcomes for equities and not the other way around bloomberg came to the correct conclusion what looks more likely is that equities ultimately succumb to the macro logic that has fueled this year s bond rally conclusion suggestions let me repeat from last week we are expecting a further correction over the next couple of months which we will use to adjust our exposures accordingly depending on how markets are developing as summer comes to its conclusion in the meantime we continue to suggest following a regular regime of risk management in portfolios step 1 clean up your portfolio tighten up stop loss levels to current support levels for each position take profits in positions that have been big winners sell laggards and losers raise cash and rebalance portfolios to target weightings step 2 compare your portfolio allocation to your model allocation determine areas requiring new or increased exposure determine how many shares need to be purchased to fill allocation requirements determine cash requirements to make purchases re examine portfolio to rebalance and raise sufficient cash for requirements determine entry price levels for each new position determine stop loss levels for each position determine sell profit taking levels for each position step 3 have positions ready to execute accordingly given the proper market set up this is a no lose play if the bull market is back you will still participate and can easily make future adjustments however if it isn t you will appreciate having less risk editor s note the summary bullets for this article were chosen by seeking alpha editors

in 2012 after officials from philadelphia harrisburg and washington orchestrated a last minute deal to keep sunoco s south philadelphia refinery from closing the new company managing the facility wrote in its application for a state grant that it needed taxpayer support to sustain the 845 jobs at the refinery create 200 permanent positions and support thousands of other temporary and indirect employment opportunities the deal which was applauded as a rare moment of bipartisanship during a time of political gridlock involved 25 million in state grants the firm also received environmental liability waivers local and state tax breaks and the transfer of federal emissions credits from sunoco s defunct marcus hook refinery seven years later with the refinery set to close following an explosion and fire and with progressives newly ascendant in local politics some economists environmentalists and politicians are questioning whether the all hands on deck effort to keep the refinery open was an effective use of taxpayer resources i m tired of our government giving public money to corporations that make big profits state rep elizabeth fiedler d philadelphia said we should not allow companies to both pollute communities and get away with not paying workers what they are owed christina simeone a senior fellow at the university of pennsylvania s kleinman center for energy policy who has studied the refinery s finances said the state should not have spent money to keep the facility open you re taking that public money and throwing it at a company that s just going to funnel it to shareholders she said if you take that taxpayer money and reinvest it into other training programs job programs for union workers economic development opportunities we d be somewhere different somewhere better than we are today the 2012 deal to keep the philadelphia refinery open involved the creation of a corporate owner philadelphia energy solutions that was a joint venture between the carlyle group a washington private equity firm and sunoco which retained a minority share the refinery has long been mired in economic struggles sunoco s plan to shutter the facility came after it failed to attract a buyer that could find a way to profit from the refinery parts of which have been operating for 150 years the 2012 deal involved the creation of a corporate owner philadelphia energy solutions that was a joint venture between the carlyle group a washington private equity firm and sunoco which retained a minority share the company declared bankruptcy in 2018 and a majority of the stock was taken over by credit suisse asset management and halcyon capital management many of the reasons the refinery became uncompetitive including the collapse of crude oil prices in 2015 and the lifting of a ban on u s oil exports were outside the company s control despite those financial woes the investors behind the 2012 deal have been able to squeeze large amounts of money out of the business carlyle and other equity partners collected 400 million in dividends before the 2018 bankruptcy although most of the state grant funding cannot be recovered the state department of transportation is investigating whether the company failed to fulfill its promises for receiving a 10 million state grant to expand the facility s rail capabilities if so the state may attempt to recoup some of that money said michael gerber spokesman for the department of community and economic development city democratic leader bob brady who as a congressman played a central role in making the 2012 deal including getting the white house involved said critics are benefiting from hindsight at the time he said it seemed unlikely the refinery would fold in a few years nobody thought that no governors no mayors no presidents no vice presidents brady said i wouldn t give people money to be open for five years the goal was to save the jobs at the refinery and protect the region s economy and energy market it was a disaster to lose this refinery and that s what everybody thought and it may still be a disaster brady said before deciding whether to invest more public money in the facility brady said officials need to determine whether the refinery s problems were outside of its control or the result of poor management last time it was the right thing to do but hey if there s mismanagement there s mismanagement he said we have got to find out whether it was bad management or if it just can t work we re not going to throw good money at bad officials are investigating whether deferred maintenance contributed to some of the plant s problems and the explosion and fire philadelphia energy solutions did not respond to a request for comment while the effort to save the refinery involved cooperation at the city state and federal levels most of the public money came from pennsylvania taxpayers from 2012 to 2014 the refinery received 15 million in grants from the redevelopment assistance capital program under gov tom corbett s administration to rebuild its outdated catalytic cracker which separates crude oil into gasoline and other products the project cost 85 million overall according to philadelphia energy solutions application for the state grant the will employ approximately 1 200 contractors during the construction process is critical to the ongoing viability of the refinery complex and thus helps protect the 845 permanent positions currently in place the company s 2012 application said through the rail transportation assistance program taxpayers also covered 10 million of the 186 million expansion and improvement of the refinery s rail head a project designed to help the facility transition from relying on more expensive foreign oil arriving by sea to more affordable oil from the bakken formation in north dakota if you don t spend it on the grants we re going to spend it on unemployment compensation we re going to spend it on welfare corbett said in a temple university report on the 2012 deal he did not respond to an interview request penndot s investigation will look into whether the company completed required maintenance and whether the traffic at the refinery met a minimum number of rail cars loaded the question of when it is effective to direct public resources to private companies is a complicated one holger sieg a university of pennsylvania economist who studies public sector investment said subsidizing refineries is probably not a good use of taxpayers money it only makes sense for local governments to subsidize firms if these firms create large enough spillovers or positive externalities for the local economy seig said it s probably better urban fiscal policy to create a tax environment that is attractive for new and existing firms brady however said the spillover benefits from the project would have more than justified the public investment if the plant were not shutting down it s not 1 000 people it s more like 5 000 people the economy driven the taxes people pay that work there people that buy cars buy clothes buy food the teamsters that drive the trucks he said i don t know how to put a dollar price on it in 2012 there was no significant opposition to the deal brady brokered that wouldn t be the case in today s political environment said joseph mclaughlin director of temple university s institute for public affairs the view at the time was we used to be a great port and a great manufacturing city and the world changed dramatically against us but now it looks like we might be able to recover at least some of that past mclaughlin said mclaughlin pointed to the increased focus on fighting climate change as part of the democratic agenda and to the left s souring on economic development spending that benefits corporations there is also a sense he said that philadelphia s economy has improved to the extent that the city does not need to cling to every employment opportunity still mclaughlin said the deal was a good one given what officials knew in 2012 our problem isn t that we re not growing our problem is that the growth is unequal there s more concern about the distribution of the city s resources and the fact that we have this very high poverty rate he said a lot of these jobs were going to be very well paying blue collar jobs
at last weekend s g20 summit global leaders focused on the digital economy and artificial intelligence their policy priorities seek to accelerate the penetration of these technologies into the global economy the implications for trade policy and multilateral policy are significant as discussed in the atlantic council post below the g20 moves hold significant implications for fintech companies generally and cryptocurrency companies specifically embracing these technology trends without agreeing common minimum standards on everything from data sharing and data privacy to cybersecurity and aml cft issues means companies on the frontier of financial regulation face heightened policy risks over the next 12 18 months while headlines from the group of twenty g20 summit in osaka japan understandably focused on the latest trade war truce between the powerhouse economies of china and the united states media coverage unfortunately overlooked a strategically significant trade policy pivot at the summit the group of global policy makers in osaka acknowledged the growing importance that the digital economy plays for supporting economic growth and innovation and the need for the trade policy paradigm to account for this shift while a substantial number of key policies needed to complete this shift remain incomplete by turning their attention toward the digital economy global policy makers could help reignite discussion at the global multilateral trade level at a time when most are obsessed with bilateral negotiations for the last year the new atlanticist has consistently highlighted the important nexus among trade the digital economy and services for advanced economies particularly the united states and the european union as well as china my colleagues and i argued in july 2018 that commonly agreed standards for trade in services can create the foundation for a more constructive set of transatlantic trade relationships while providing support for chinese growth the key to progress regarding services trade is as much about finding ways to make domestic regulatory frameworks interoperable as it is about successes in the world trade organization regarding the trade in services agreement policy makers have been making quiet steady progress throughout 2019 so far regarding these issues the wto has taken steps to increase transparency regarding non tariff regulatory barriers in order to provide a foundation for concrete data based policy discussions the european commission has been quietly increasing its efforts to enhance transatlantic regulatory cooperation starting with technical standards that support the broader ongoing discussions regarding manufacturing sector conformity assessments additionally the bilateral us china trade tensions that have been much on display this year have not just been about tariffs on old economy sectors the most intractable issues have been focused on services policy issues in sectors strategically significant for supporting twenty first century growth as noted in this post and as highlighted in the white paper released by the chinese government on june 2 which championed the importance of economic sovereignty and national standards these actions laid the foundation for the policy shift articulated in osaka on june 29 the osaka declaration traditional trade policy experts will find the osaka declaration underwhelming the declaration notes the importance of addressing the dispute resolution problems at the wto without identifying how the impasse can be resolved the declaration indirectly recognizes accelerating centrifugal forces away from centralized multilateral solutions by noting that bilateral and regional free trade agreements are complementary to the broader goal of promoting free trade g20 leaders chose not to repeat their trade ministers language from earlier this month identifying urgency regarding wto reforms generally ministerial para 54 or the wto committee work reforms specifically ministerial para 56 in other words g20 leaders implicitly underscored the impasse at the multilateral level by failing to identify concrete measures that might break the impasse to be fair g20 leaders in these areas only repeated verbatim the ministerial statement on trade policy issued in advance of the summit earlier this month the news cycle fixation on the bilateral china us trade truce illustrates the scale of the challenge it is not just policy makers focused on bilateral rather than multilateral issues pundits experts and stakeholders are also focused primarily on bilateral matters a shift towards services and the digital economy the good news from the osaka declaration is that policy makers are pivoting hard and fast towards a new set of issues on trade where policy interests may be more aligned new issue areas traditionally provide opportunities for constructive engagement because entrenched positions have not yet had a chance to develop trade policy experts focused on the services sector and the digital economy will be delighted with the osaka declaration because it indicates that policy makers are shifting their attention away from trade in goods in order to craft a new policy foundation focused on the twenty first century digital economy consider two examples from the declaration paragraph 6 underscores the importance of taking a holistic perspective that includes all components of the current account including services trade and income balances when evaluating economic and trade policies as many have noted the united states holds a persistent and substantial bilateral trade surplus with china when services are included data from the united states trade representative indicates that in 2018 the united states also held a 60 billion surplus in services trade with european union countries as compared with a 169 billion goods deficit consequently a shift to a more comprehensive assessment of trade relationships holds potentially constructive implications for transatlantic trade talks as well paragraph 11 stresses the importance of interface between trade and digital economy and indicates that g20 policy makers seek to further facilitate data free flow these are small but significant shifts in policy attention the challenges from here yet it is too soon to celebrate the policy shift articulated in the osaka declaration is not backed by concrete initiatives moreover the policy issues raised by increased attention to digital economy issues promise to highlight the growing tension between national standards and multilateral efforts to generate cross border consensus the osaka declaration confirms that the distributed age featuring less centralized decision making structures has indeed arrived the osaka declaration indicates the international system is evolving accordingly with a pivot to non tariff regulatory barriers at its core for example g20 policy makers committed in osaka only to support the sharing of good practices on effective policy and regulatory approaches and frameworks including regulatory sandboxes para 12 these are profoundly national regulatory initiatives which to date have be used at least as much by policy makers to foster competition across jurisdictions as opposed to promoting consistency in standards across borders the ai principles originally articulated by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd were also endorsed but the declaration underscores that the principles are non binding para 12 finally efforts to promote increased cross border data flows have been positioned with the goal of achieving interoperability osaka declaration para 11 ministerial statement para 16 this goal lays the foundation for intense bargaining among chinese policy priorities for national standards regarding intellectual property rights us national security priorities and european priorities for privacy and data protection these competing interests all point towards tactical tensions in future talks conclusion increased transparency regarding good practices and interoperability among different national systems may generate a pragmatic way forward for the global economy it may also provide an opening for renewed transatlantic leadership where many of the relevant standards are far more well developed and in many cases are compatible with each other engaging in open honest exchanges of view may also reinvigorate the multilateral process at the wto and elsewhere because these entities provide the only structures for sustained discussion expectations for quick action however need to be tempered the differences in values and priorities at national level run deep trust among the major participants in the trade policy debate is running low even as rhetorical heat runs high the current climate for policy volatility lurching between trade wars and trade truces seems set to continue even as policy makers agree to shift gears

executive summary increased concerns about global growth slowing and downside risks from trade resulted in deteriorating macro economic conditions in the first half of 2019 as a result of the prevailing financial conditions the u s federal reserve signaled it is open to cutting interest rates to stimulate growth and sustain the current economic expansion the s p 500 index produced a return of 17 35 in the first half of 2019 its best first half since 1997 in our view the current year to date index returns in the u s are unlikely to continue at this rapid pace we continue to advocate a globally diversified multi factor multi asset etf moreover we strongly believe sticking with a long term investing plan will increase the probability of accomplishing one s financial goals u s federal reserve at its june meeting the u s federal reserve chairman jerome powell announced that the committee would keep the u s federal funds rate target range steady at 2 25 2 50 however the federal reserve provided a strong indication that it is open to cutting interest rates in order to sustain the current economic expansion a significant number of the committee members now favor an interest rate cut of 50bps before year end seven members now see 50bps of rate cuts in 2019 one sees a 25bps rate cut and eight members see interest rates on hold that s a significant shift from the march fomc meeting where eleven members saw rates on hold this year in our view the federal reserve is reacting to a weaker global growth environment rising uncertainty about trade policy and negative sentiment about the global economic outlook yield curve the inversion of the u s yield curve is a topic that the financial media continues to caution followers historically a negative yield curve implies investors expect future short term rates to be lower as the federal reserve eases policy in response to a potential recession according to j p morgan research 7 out of the 8 u s yield curve inversions since 1960 were followed by a recession while the media has been focusing on the 3 month treasury bill vs 10 year treasury inverted yield curve not all parts of the u s interest rate yield curve are inverted for instance the 2 year vs 10 year spread remains positive at 24 82bps as of june 28 2019 in fact the 2 year vs 10 year spread has historically been more of a bellwether for predicting economic recessions and has been steadily steepening since the 4th quarter of 2018 source bloomberg astoria portfolio advisors according to j p morgan research the number of months between the 2 year vs 10 year inversion and the subsequent recession has increased 17 months for the prior 3 yield curve inversions compared to the prior four inversions 9 months moreover j p morgan s research group notes that there was a 22 month lag between the time the yield curve inverted in 2008 and the subsequent recession the ny federal reserve bank maintains a recession probability index for the next 12 months ahead as of may 31 2019 the ny federal reserve s recession probability index for 2020 stands at 29 62 see chart below source bloomberg new york federal reserve astoria portfolio advisors tariffs the g20 summit took place on june 28 2019 the u s administration announced that it will hold off on 25 tariffs on the remaining us 300 billion u s imports from china china announced that it would continue to purchase agricultural products from the u s moreover both countries announced it will roll back some non tariff barriers such as restrictions on high tech exports by u s companies the bad news is that uncertainty remains as there is no clear path towards a comprehensive resolution from our perch we believe that lingering uncertainty will continue to provide an overhang on the global economic outlook and trade and will lead a drag on global growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 economic data valuations and portfolio construction global economic data has

which has a p e ratio of 17 47x based on 2019 analyst estimates in our view emerging market equities china in particular remain attractive for long term investors as they are trading at a substantial valuation discount compared to the u s stock market according to etfaction com the ishares msci china etf mchi is projected to have 15 00 eps growth based on 2019 analyst estimates whereas the s p 500

source federal reserve bank of ny bloomberg astoria portfolio advisors we have written that gold was attractive in a multi asset portfolio as it serves as a valuable diversifier during times of stress as a reminder our gold allocation helped soften our portfolio volatility in the 4th quarter of 2018 as gold rose 7 53 while the s p 500 index declined 13 52 market timing our long standing view is that timing the market top and bottom is extremely difficult and that investors are incentivized to stay fully invested the past 3 quarters have proved our point the s p 500 index declined 13 52 in the 4th quarter of 2018 and then rallied 17 35 in the 1st half of 2019 we continue to advocate not only to stay fully invested but to maintain a globally diversified multi asset portfolio best john

mccarthy chief markets strategist at cmc markets in sydney in a note to clients the problem is the widening of the dispute europe the us and china account for almost two thirds of global gdp he said an ongoing disruption to trade between these three major economies prosecuted for domestic political purposes could sink global growth weak manufacturing manufacturing surveys over the past 24 hours

by make america great again don t count on it donald trump was partly voted into office by americans who felt that the self proclaimed greatest power on earth was actually in decline and they weren t wrong trump is capable of tweeting many things but none of those tweets will stop that process of decline nor will a trade war with a rising china or fierce oil sanctions on iran you could feel this recently even in the case of the increasingly pressured iranians there with a single pinprick supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei effectively punctured president trump s maga balloon and reminded many that however powerful the u s still was people in other countries were beginning to look at america differently at the end of the second decade of the twenty first century following a meeting in tehran with visiting japanese prime minister shinzo abe who brought a message from trump urging the start of u s iranian negotiations khamenei tweeted we have no doubt in goodwill and seriousness but regarding what you mentioned from u s president i don t consider trump as a person deserving to exchange messages with and i have no answer for him nor will i respond to him in the future he then added we believe that our problems will not be solved by negotiating with the u s and no free nation would ever accept negotiations under pressure a flustered trump was reduced to briefly tweeting i personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal they are not ready and neither are we and soon after the president halted at the last minute in a distinctly humiliating retreat u s air strikes on iranian missile sites that would undoubtedly have created yet more insoluble problems for washington across the greater middle east keep in mind that globally before the ayatollah s put down the trump administration had already had two abject foreign policy failures the collapse of the president s hanoi summit with north korean leader kim jong un followed by that regime s provocative firing of several missiles over the sea of japan and a bungled attempt to overthrow the regime of venezuelan president nicolás maduro america s global standing at a record low what s great or small can be defined in absolute or relative terms america s greatness or exceptional or indispensable nature much lauded in washington before the trump era should certainly be judged against the economic progress made by china in those same years and against russia s advances in the latest high tech weaponry another way of assessing the nature of that greatness and what to make of it would be through polls of how foreigners view the united states take for instance a survey released by the pew research group in february 2019 forty five percent of respondents in 26 nations with large populations felt that american power and influence posed a major threat to our country while 36 offered the same response on russia and 35 on china to put that in perspective in 2013 during the presidency of barack obama only 25 of global respondents held such a negative view of the u s while reactions to china remained essentially the same or just consider the most powerful country in europe germany between 2013 and 2018 germans who considered american power and influence a greater threat than that of china or russia leapt from 19 to 49 figures for france were similar as for president trump only 27 of global respondents had confidence in him to do the right thing in world affairs while 70 feared he would not in mexico you undoubtedly won t be surprised to learn confidence in his leadership was at a derisory 6 in 17 of the surveyed countries people who lacked confidence in him were also significantly more likely to consider the u s the world s top threat a phenomenon most pronounced among traditional washington allies like canada great britain and australia china s expanding global footprint while 39 of pew respondents in that poll still rated the u s as the globe s leading economic power 34 opted for china meanwhile china s belt and road initiative bri launched in 2013 to link the infrastructure and trade of much of southeast asia eurasia and the horn of africa to china at an estimated cost of four trillion dollars and to be funded by diverse sources is going from strength to strength one way to measure this the number of dignitaries attending the biennial bri forum in beijing the first of those gatherings in may 2017 attracted 28 heads of state and representatives from 100 countries the most recent in late april had 37 heads of state and representatives from nearly 150 countries and international organizations including international monetary fund imf chief christine lagarde and united nations secretary general antonio guterres leaders of nine out of 10 association of southeast asian nations attended as did four of the five central asian republics strikingly a third of the leaders participating came from europe according to peter frankopan author of the new silk roads more than 80 countries are now involved in some aspect of the bri project that translates into more than 63 of the world s population and 29 of its global economic output still chinese president xi jinping is intent on expanding the bri s global footprint further a signal of china s dream of future greatness during a february two day state visit to beijing by saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman xi suggested that when it came to riyadh s overly ambitious economic plan our two countries should speed up the signing of an implementation plan on connecting the belt and road initiative with the saudi vision 2030 flattered by this proposal the crown prince defended china s use of re education camps for uighur muslims in its western province of xinjiang claiming it was beijing s right to carry out antiterrorism work to safeguard national security under the guise of combating extremism the chinese authorities have placed an estimated one million uighur muslims in such camps to undergo re education designed to supplant their islamic legacy with a chinese version of socialism uighur groups had appealed to prince bin salman to take up their cause no such luck one more sign of the rise of china in the twenty first century china enters the high tech race with america in 2013 the german government launched an industry 4 0 plan meant to fuse cyber physical systems the internet of things cloud computing and cognitive computing with the aim of increasing manufacturing productivity by up to 50 while curtailing resources required by half two years later emulating this project beijing published its own 10 year made in china 2025 plan to update the country s manufacturing base by rapidly developing 10 high tech industries including electric cars and other new energy vehicles next generation information technology and telecommunications as well as advanced robotics and artificial intelligence aerospace engineering high end rail infrastructure and high tech maritime engineering as with bri the government and media then publicized and promoted made in china 2025 vigorously this alarmed washington and america s high tech corporations over the years american companies had complained about china s theft of u s intellectual property the counterfeiting of famous brands and the stealing of trade secrets not to speak of the pressuring of american firms in joint ventures with local companies to share technology as a price for gaining access to china s vast market their grievances became more vocal when donald trump entered the white house determined to cut washington s annual trade deficit of 380 billion with beijing as president trump ordered his new trade representative the sinophobe robert lighthizer to look into the matter the resulting seven month investigation pegged the loss u s companies experienced because of china s unfair trade practices at 50 billion a year that was why in march 2018 president trump instructed lighthizer to levy tariffs on at least 50 billion worth of chinese imports that signaled the start of a sino american trade war which has only gained steam since in this context chinese officials started downplaying the significance of made in china 2025 describing it as nothing more than an inspirational plan this march china s national people s congress even passed a foreign direct investment law meant to address some of the grievances of u s companies its implementation mechanism was however weak trump promptly claimed that china had backtracked on its commitments to incorporate into chinese law significant changes the two countries had negotiated and put into a draft agreement to end the trade war he then slapped further tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports the major bone of contention for the trump administration is a chinese law specifying that in a joint venture between a foreign corporation and a chinese company the former must pass on technological know how to its chinese partner that s seen as theft by washington according to senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace yukon huang author of cracking the china conundrum why conventional economic wisdom is wrong however it s fully in accord with globally accepted guidelines such diffusion of technological know how has played a significant role in driving growth globally as the imf s 2018 world economic outlook report made clear it s worth noting as well that china now accounts for almost one third of global annual economic growth the size of china s market is so vast and the rise in its per capita gross domestic product from 312 in 1980 to 9 769 in 2018 so steep that major u s corporations generally accepted its long established joint venture law and that should surprise no one last year for instance general motors sold 3 645 044 vehicles in china and fewer than three million in the u s little wonder then that late last year following gm plant closures across north america part of a wide ranging restructuring plan the company s management paid no heed to a threat from president trump to strip gm of any government subsidies what angered the president as he tweeted caught the reality of the moment nothing was being closed in mexico and china what trump simply can t accept is this after nearly two decades of supply chain restructuring and global economic integration china has become thekey industrial supplier for the united states and europe his attempt to make america great again by restoring the economic status quo ante before 2001 the year china was admitted to the world trade organization is doomed to fail in reality trade war or peace china is now beginning to overtake the u s in science and technology a study by qingnan xie of nanjing university of science and technology and richard freeman of harvard university noted that between 2000 and 2016 china s global share of publications in the physical sciences engineering and mathmatics quadrupled and in the process exceeded that of the u s for the first time in the field of high technology for example china is now well ahead of the united states in mobile payment transactions in the first 10 months of 2017 those totaled 12 8 trillion the result of vast numbers of consumers discarding credit cards in favor of cashless systems in stark contrast according to emarketer america s mobile payment transactions in 2017 amounted to 49 3 billion last year 583 million chinese used mobile payment systems with nearly 68 of china s internet users turning to a mobile wallet for their offline payments russia s advanced weaponry in a similar fashion in his untiring pitch for america s beautiful weaponry president trump has failed to grasp the impressive progress russia has made in that field while presenting videos and animated glimpses of new intercontinental ballistic missiles nuclear powered cruise missiles and underwater drones in a march 2018 television address russian president vladimir putin traced the development of his own country s new weapons to washington s decision to pull out of the 1972 anti ballistic missile abm treaty with the soviet union in december 2001 encouraged by john bolton then under secretary of state for arms control and international security president george w bush had indeed withdrawn from the 1972 abm treaty on the spurious grounds that the 9 11 attacks had changed the nature of defense for america his russian counterpart of the time the very same vladimir putin described the withdrawal from that cornerstone of world security as a grievous mistake the head of russia s armed forces general anatoly kvashnin warned then that the pullout would alter the nature of the international strategic balance freeing up countries to restart arms buildups both conventional and nuclear as it happened he couldn t have been more on the mark the u s is now engaged in a 30 year trillion dollar plus remake and update of its nuclear arsenal while the russians whose present inventory of 6 500 nuclear weapons slightly exceeds america s have gone down a similar route in that televised address of his on the eve of the 2018 russian presidential election putin s list of new nuclear weapons was headed by the sarmat a 30 ton intercontinental ballistic missile reputedly far harder for an enemy to intercept in its most vulnerable phase just after launching it also carries a larger number of nuclear warheads than its predecessor another new weapon on his list was a nuclear powered intercontinental underwater drone status 6 a submarine launched autonomous vehicle with a range of 6 800 miles capable of carrying a 100 megaton nuclear warhead and then there was his country s new nuclear powered cruise missile with a practically unlimited range in addition because of its stealth capabilities it will be hard to detect in flight and its high maneuverability will theoretically at least enable it to bypass an enemy s defenses successfully tested in 2018 it does not yet have a name unsurprisingly putin won the presidency with 77 of the vote a 13 rise from the previous poll on record voter turnout of 67 7 in conventional weaponry russia s s 400 missile system remains unrivalled according to the washington based arms control association the s 400 system is an advanced mobile surface to air defense system of radars and missiles of different ranges capable of destroying a variety of targets such as attack aircraft bombs and tactical ballistic missiles each battery normally consists of eight launchers 112 missiles and command and support vehicles the s 400 missile has a range of 400 kilometers 250 miles and its integrated system is believed to be capable of shooting down up to 80 targets simultaneously consider it a sign of the times but in defiance of pressure from the trump administration not to buy russian weaponry president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey the only muslim member of nato ordered the purchase of batteries of those very s 400 missiles turkish soldiers are currently being trained on that weapons systems in russia the first battery is expected to arrive in turkey next month similarly in april 2015 russia signed a contract to supply s 400 missiles to china the first delivery of the system took place in january 2018 and china test fired it in august an expanding beijing moscow alliance consider that as another step in russian chinese military coordination meant to challenge washington s claim to be the planet s sole superpower similarly last september 3 500 chinese troops participated in russia s largest ever military exercises involving 300 000 soldiers 36 000 military vehicles 80 ships and 1 000 aircraft helicopters and drones codenamed vostok 2018 it took place across a vast region that included the bering sea the sea of okhotsk and the sea of japan little wonder that nato officials describedvostok 2018 as a demonstration of a growing russian focus on future large scale conflict it fits into a pattern we have seen over some time a more assertive russia significantly increasing its defense budget and its military presence putin attended the exercises after hosting an economic forum in vladivostok where chinese president xi was his guest we have trustworthy ties in political security and defense spheres he declared while xi praised the two countries friendship which he claimed was getting stronger all the time thanks to climate change russia and china are now also working in tandem in the fast melting arctic last year russia which controls more than half the arctic coastline sent its first ship through the northern sea route without an icebreaker in winter putin hailed that moment as a big event in the opening up of the arctic beijing s arctic policy first laid out in january 2018 described china as a near arctic state and visualized the future shipping routes there as part of a potential new polar silk road that would both be useful for resource exploitation and for enhancing chinese security shipping goods to and from europe by such a passage would shorten the distance to china by 30 compared to present sea routes through the malacca straits and the suez canal saving hundreds of thousands of dollars per voyage according to the u s geological survey the arctic holds petroleum reserves equal to 412 billion barrels of oil or about 22 of the world s undiscovered hydrocarbons it also has deposits of rare earth metals china s second arctic vessel xuelong 2 snow dragon 2 is scheduled to make its maiden voyage later this year russia needs chinese investment to extract the natural resources under its permafrost in fact china is already the biggest foreign investor in russia s liquefied natural gas lng projects in the region and the first lng shipment was dispatched to china s eastern province last summer via the northern sea route its giant oil corporation is now beginning to drill for gas in russian waters alongside the russian company gazprom washington is rattled in april in its latest annual report to congress on china s military power the pentagon for the first time included a section on the arctic warning of the risks of a growing chinese presence in the region including that country s possible deployment of nuclear submarines there in the future in may secretary of state mike pompeo used a meeting of foreign ministers in rovaniemi finland to assail china for its aggressive behavior in the arctic in an earlier speech pompeo noted that from 2012 to 2017 china invested nearly 90 billion in the arctic region we re concerned about russia s claim over the international waters of the northern sea route including its newly announced plans to connect it with china s maritime silk road he said he then pointed out that along that route moscow already illegally demands other nations request permission to pass requires russian maritime pilots to be aboard foreign ships and threatens to use military force to sink any that fail to comply with their demands an american downturn continues altogether the tightening military and economic ties between russia and china have put america on the defensive contrary to donald trump s maga promise to american voters in the 2016 campaign it s true that despite fraying diplomatic and economic ties between washington and moscow trump s personal relations with putin remain cordial the two periodically exchange friendly phone calls but among russians more generally a favorable view of the u s fell from 41 in 2017 to 26 in 2018 according to a pew research survey there s nothing new about great powers even the one that proclaimed itself the greatest in history declining after having risen high in our acrimonious times that s a reality well worth noting while launching his bid for reelection recently trump proposed a bombastic new slogan keep america great or kag as if he had indeed raised america s stature while in office he would have been far more on target however had he suggested the slogan depress america more or dam to reflect the reality of an unpopular president who faces rising great power rivals abroad this essay first appeared on tomdispatch
menafn ing a great first half for the loonie at the time of writing cad is the best performing currency in the g10 space since the start of the year 4 09 vs usd to be precise we verecently revised our usd cadforecast profile lower and now expect 1 30 by the end of the year looking at the past six months usd cad has been highly correlated with three market factors crude oil prices interest rate spreads and market risk sentiment the shape of the yield curve and relative equities performance tend to show a less relevant correlation read our latest issue of fx talking the beginning of the end of the dollar s rally bloomberg ing in the current market environment the largest risk to an open economy like canada and its currency are the ongoing trade tensions the recently agreed trade truce and the restart of negotiations for a deal between the us and china will probably keep market risk sentiment supported for some time although looking ahead our trade team is reluctant toexclude a re escalation of trade tensions and we don t exclude the us imposing fresh tariffs on chinese exports as early as in 3q some market attention will also be on the canadian federal elections scheduled for october the latest vote projections suggest the incumbent liberal party is bound to face a defeat by andrew sheer s conservative party but for the time being we don t see a high market moving potential to the elections we think there are at least five reasons which suggest positives will more than offset most trade related downside risks and keep the canadian dollar on an appreciating path oil prices are likely to stay supported our commodities team expects the ongoing opec meeting and the opec meeting tomorrow to deliberatefurther supply tightening in the crude market latest media reports indicate that members should all be in agreement to extend the current deal for 1 2mmbbls d of output cuts this would come as a positive at a time when oil prices have already found some support from us iran tensions and we expect wti keep to edge above 60 bbl nonetheless the outlook for the regional benchmark western canada select is slightly gloomier after reports that the canadian state of alberta is planning to increase its production limits while this may translate into a partial re widening of the western texas intermediate and western canadian select wti wcs spread the very low correlation of the spread with usd cad performance tends to suggest the impact on the currency pair may be quite limited inflation is strong economy is set for a rebound we believe a number of indicators likely back the constructive economic view expressed by the bank of canada in its latest statement inflation in canada is strong the core measure has touched 2 3 in may a 10 year high the headline print also surprised to the upside at 2 4 both measures currently fall in the upper half of the boc inflation target band looking ahead our economists expect inflation to stay broadly in line with the 2 median target at least until the end of 2020 the labour market looks healthy unemployment rate 5 8 in march is close to historical lows the participation rate has rebounded from late 2018 lows and wage growth 2 55 in may has been quite robust q1 subdued gdp numbers have been negatively affected by a widening trade deficit a recovery in the deficit has already started to benefit gdp monthly reads april yoy read at 1 5 suggesting that the canadian economy likely bottomed out in q1 we currently forecast 1 5 growth in 3q19 and 1 7 both in 4q19 and 1q20 a further boost to exports will likely come from the ratification of the usmca trade deal which seems to be close to being passed by the us congress as democrats oppositions have fanned the fed will blink first the boc may not blink at all the strong fundamentals listed above have been indeed acknowledged by canada s central bank in its latest statement as they reiterated an accommodative policy stance accordingly our economics team expects the boc to keep rates on hold throughout 2019 and 2020 this is in contrast with markets expectations for some monetary easing ahead with the ois curve currently showing 25bp priced in by 2q20 on the other side of the border the federal reserve is facing increasing pressure to cut interest rates and our economists expect two rate cuts by the end of the year such policy divergence is likely to keep the us canada interest rate differential under pressure bloomberg ing cad has been historically strong before a us recession from a different perspective historical evidence from the three most recent us recessions suggests that the cad has been amongst the best performers in the g10 space as usd weakened whilst approaching a us recession looking ahead investors may see in the loonie an interesting substitute to the us dollar to enter carry trades as the dollar rate advantage staggers indeed cad is currently the second highest yielding currency short term rates in the g10 space according to our economists forecasts canada will have the highest 3 month yields in 3q20 this would keep cad supported as investors may rush to enter carry trade positions in the coming quarters before unwinding them as increased risk of a global economic downturn threatens their profitability bloomberg ing cad can still benefit from short positioning despite the recent bullish mood on the cad commodity futures trading commission cftc data shows that combined net speculative position on the loonie is still in short territory 9 of open interest this tends to suggest that there is still some room for position squaring related downside risk in usd cad especially when considering that positioning on usd is on the opposite still extensively long we see high potential for cad to keep outperforming its g10 peers in the coming quarters nonetheless the fall in usd cad may be contained around the 1 31 1 32 level until trade tension related downside risks dissipate in the longer run we stick to our forecasts for 1 30 in 4q19 1 28 in 1q20 and 1 26 in 2q20
during the second night of the first democratic debate moderator savannah guthrie asked bernie sanders a pointed question my question to you is will taxes go up for the middle class in a sanders administration and if so how do you sell that to voters the vermont senator defended his plans in his typical populist way saying health care in my view is a human right and we have got to pass a medicare for all single payer system but then he added under that system the vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for health care than they are right now and acknowledged that guthrie was quite right that middle class taxes would have to go up for that to happen it was a rare moment when someone running for the democratic presidential nomination admitted that their spending ambitions would have to be paid for by taxes that touch not just the wealthiest americans but taxpayers further down the bracket government provided health care programs tend to be quite popular and majorities think the rich pay too little in taxes but for the same reason no one much likes talking about raising middle class taxes even if it s to provide social services that are popular universal health care government funded or provided child care generous parental leave free college when you squint at the left flank of the democratic primary where sanders and elizabeth warren support some or all of these policies you see a vision for a radically different america for the most part this different america will be paid for by the rich and corporations when elizabeth warren comes out with an ambitious domestic spending program like her child care proposal or free college and debt relief she dutifully pairs it up with a specific tax proposal that matches the populist tenor of the spending child care and higher education are paid for by a tax on the ultra wealthy affordable housing is paid for by an estate tax that hits a broader range of heirs green energy investments are paid for by a reformed and expanded corporate tax sanders s ambitions are less detailed but no less expansive big plans that are accompanied by big taxes on the wealth and income of the richest americans but his concession at the debate that taxes on the middle class may have to go up is an acknowledgement of a stubborn fact to begin to transform america into something more like the nordic democracies the us may have to tax like those countries as well and contrary to what many us progressives might believe the nordic countries and the rich industrialized democracies that provide a wider range of social services actually have more regressive taxation systems than the us that is while the overall taxes imposed on the economy are substantially higher the tax systems raise revenue from up and down the income distribution and relatively little from wealth taxes if they have them at all trying to sell a big progeessive agenda on the backs of the rich may be popular but the admission that middle class taxes may have to go up is an admission that there may not be enough rich people in america to pay for it all what s more with their relentless focus on high income high wealth taxation progressives may well be admitting that the social consensus in favor of these new programs is not as strong as they would hope and they may be missing the chance to lay the groundwork for social policies that inspire a sense of solidarity a feeling that a broader share of the country is united behind a project that it is willing to pay for how the high tax countries pay the nordic countries the ones that sanders and many progressives love to point to as economically sustainable and expansive welfare states have a tax system that s far different from the one in the us today denmark raises almost 15 percent of its gdp and 32 percent of its total taxes from taxes on consumption including a 25 percent value added tax compared to 4 percent of gdp and 16 percent of all taxes raised through sales and other consumption taxes in the us according to the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd denmark s labor market policies unemployment paternity and maternity leave retraining are funded by a flat 8 percent tax on all wages norway sweden and denmark all raise at least 28 percent of their tax revenue from consumption taxes in addition to having higher top income rates than the united states if we think of a stereotypical western european or nordic country they re taxing and spending 10 percent to 15 percent more of gdp than we are most into welfare state and education lane kenworthy a sociologist at the university of california san diego said as best we can tell most of these countries if not all have tax systems that are slightly less progressive than ours is the federal tax system in the us is largely built of taxes where people with high income pay more of their earnings than those with less thanks to the income tax corporate taxes and the estate tax the big exception is the payroll taxes that fund social security and parts of medicare social security taxes make up about 23 percent of all taxes according to the oecd and over a third of all federal taxes according to the joint committee on taxation and suck up a lot of revenue directly from wage income but only up to a cap of 132 900 what that means is that higher wage earners pay proportionally less in social security taxes while also having incomes that typically rely less on wages but the contribution is still smaller than from income taxes which make up over 38 percent of all taxes in other words the nordic countries don t just have a higher tax take than the us they get their tax revenue from a broader segment of the population if you re going to spend an awful lot of money you have to go where the money is and the money is all over the place kenworthy says while the nordic countries can have high top rates 60 percent in sweden 56 percent in denmark 38 percent in norway according to the oecd this includes local and federal taxes they kick in at a substantially lower proportion of the average wage than in the united states in the us people who earn about nine times the average household wage over 510 000 pay the top rate in the three nordics the top rate kicks in at less than two times the average wage in sweden the top rate kicks in at around 77 000 according to the oecd in the us there is a real reluctance to be seen as raising taxes on the middle class or talk about raising taxes on the middle class even if hitched to really popular initiatives said molly michelmore a historian at washington and lee who s studied the politics and history of the us tax system i m hard pressed to think about a moment when you have anybody who was talking openly about taxing the vast middle class as a central part of a social compact we re going to tax you and get these things back taxing just the rich isn t newfangled democratic socialism it s obama ism it s not just the left of the democratic party who operate from this framework of taxing the rich to deliver universal or targeted benefits obama famously promised not to raise taxes on couples making below 250 000 and was able to implement a vast new social program the affordable care act by going after investment income and medicare taxes for those making more there was also a tanning salon tax and the now zeroed out individual mandate penalty through a deal with senate republicans he was also able to reverse the bush tax cuts for couples making 450 000 or more and in the process meaningfully increasing how much taxes were being paid by the very richest but the us is also far more unequal than its fellow large industrialized democracies meaning that for progressives the stratospheric incomes and wealth at the top are juicy targets not just for revenue but also for helping restructure society in a more egalitarian way as such the emerging progressive approach is far different from what prevails in europe s social democracies inspired by the pioneering work of economists like thomas piketty emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman who have long produced estimates of a high top share of income and wealth in the united states elizabeth warren and other progressives are coming up with new and aggressive ways to tax wealth elizabeth warren s wealth tax which is based on work done by saez and piketty would affect fortunes of 50 million with a 2 percent tax on total wealth and then an extra 1 percent for wealth greater than 1 billion zucman is also a specialist in tracking tax evasion by the ultra wealthy suggesting that high end estimates of inequality may even be too low saez and zucman estimate that such a tax would raise 2 75 trillion over 10 years providing enough revenue to cover many of warren s ambitious plans but it would also be near unprecedented and several economists doubt the campaign s estimations larry summers the former treasury secretary and natasha sarin a professor at the university of pennsylvania have argued that the tax would raise far less saez and zucman have defended their initial estimate but there is no escaping the simple fact that few countries fund a substantial portion of their spending through these kinds of high end taxes only three oecd countries have wealth taxes several european countries have scrapped them an oecd report says due to efficiency and administrative concerns and by the observation that net wealth taxes have frequently failed to meet their redistributive goal and the revenue hauls have been disappointing according to researchers at the ifo institute for economic research wealth taxes generate revenue amounting to just 3 7 percent of total tax revenue in switzerland 1 1 percent in norway and 0 5 percent in spain and in all three cases the exemption from the wealth tax was substantially lower than in warren s plan warren has yet to unveil her health care plan although she indicated last week that she supports sanders s medicare for all plan such a plan would overhaul the entirety of the us health care system with a single payer system funded through general revenue and debt here the promise of a vast welfare state solely funded by new taxes on the rich runs aground while sanders has not endorsed any specific financing mechanism he s listed some options including payroll taxes for employers an income charge on families making the wealthy pay more in taxes hiking capital gains taxes a wealth tax and a variety of corporate taxes to that list of options sanders raised another during the debate middle class taxpayers will pay more in taxes if he wants to make an america that s anything like the countries he admires they ll have to and more importantly they ll have to want to willingly expand and broaden the tax burden in order to sustainably fund the large programs so many democrats at least are pushing that would be a real political revolution

christine lagarde nominated for european central bank president quits the international monetary fund draghi accepts her as the successor european union leaders have chosen christine lagarde for european central bank president there has been a package of appointments that have also included the foreign policy chief the head of the eu parliament as well as the president of the leaders council furtehr down we look into what this could mean for the ecb policy and euro key developments imf chief christine lagarde chosen for european central bank president germany s ursula von der leyen chosen for the commission presidency spain s josep borrell chosen for the foreign policy chief position what does this mean for the foreign exchange market well the markets have not been sure what to make of the choice and after all draghi will still be at the helm until october and this may not change the landscape for the immediate nor the medium term future at the ecb with respect to monetary policy which governs the direction in the nation s currency however what is striking is that this is the first person to take in the role of the ecb without being a career central banker she s really a political figure much more so than an economist until this weekend the main contenders for the ecb job were central bankers and who were current or former members of the governing council who had all previously participated in decisions on monetary policy what is refreshing to see is that she is also the first women to take on the role and her political sales and marketing skills could help repair the image of central bankers in her career she thrived as french finance minister during the financial crisis before graduating to the imf in washington clearly she has not been chosen to simply carry on the old ways of the ecb and it feels like there is going to be a real shake up within the ecb s staff as she will need to depend on them to come up with some imaginative stuff in order to find solutions to the euro zone s economic challenges we will need to dig deeper and pay very close attention to how closely she supported draghi s approach for clues as to how she might intend to fulfil her role at the helm as yohay elam senior analyst at fxstreet advised earlier the french politician is significantly dovish as head of the imf she has advocated monetary and fiscal stimulus calling on both central banks and governments to keep helping the economy conclusion will she wrap up the stimulus programme as to give the ecb some ammunition should the economy deteriorate further for the euro is already sinking to the bottom and interest rates can t go any lower or will she stick to the programme and continue along with a dovish rhetoric that is where the fx play will be extra reading
that s worrying because the model has been spot on with its predictions of the 2007 2001 early nineties early eighties recessions via forbes the current u s economic expansion turned ten years old in june and is poised to become the longest u s economic expansion in history in july considering all of the threats that the economy has faced in the past decade it s practically a miracle that the expansion has gone for so long without any hiccups unfortunately there are an increasing number of signs that are warning that the expansion is soon coming to end and that a recession is not far away particularly alarming is the fact that the new york fed s very accurate recession probability model is warning that the current odds of a recession in the next year are the same as they were in july 2007 which is when the subprime debt crisis kicked into high gear the new york fed s recession probability model is currently warning that there is a 30 probability of a recession in the next 12 months the last time that recession odds were the same as they are now was in july 2007 which was just five months before the great recession officially started in december 2007 july 2007 was also when bear stearns two subprime hedge funds lost nearly all of their value which ultimately contributed to the investment bank s demise and the sharp escalation of the u s financial crisis jesse colombo though a 30 probability of a recession in the next 12 months may not seem very high the reality is that the new york fed s model has had a strong tendency to underestimate the probability of recessions in the past three decades for example this model only gave a 33 probability of a recession in july 1990 which is when the early 1990s recession started it only gave a 21 probability of a recession in march 2001 which is when the early 2000s recession started it also only gave a 39 probability of a recession in december 2007 which is when the great recession started the new york fed s model has underestimated the probability of recessions in the past three decades because it is skewed by the unusual recessions of the early 1980s that were caused by fed chair paul volcker s aggressive interest rate hikes that were intended to end the persistent double digit inflation at that time i ve found that this model gives more accurate estimates of recession probabilities when only data after the early 1980s is considered and normalized so that the highest reading during that time period is equivalent to 100 this methodology warned that there was an 85 chance of a recession in december 2007 which is when the great recession officially started the standard model only gave a 39 probability according to this new methodology there is a 64 chance of a recession in the next 12 months jesse colombo you may also like the new york fed s recession probability model is based on the 10 year and 3 month treasury yield spread which is the difference between 10 year and 3 month treasury rates during economic expansions the 10 year treasury yield is higher than the 3 month treasury yield right before a recession however this spread inverts as the 3 month treasury yield rises higher than the 10 year treasury rate this is called an inverted yield curve as the chart below shows the yield curve has inverted before all modern recessions the 10 year and 3 month treasury spread inverted in may which warns that a recession is not far off jesse colombo i am very concerned that the coming recession will not be a typical garden variety recession because an incredible number of new bubbles have formed in the past decade thanks to global central banks stimulative monetary policies these bubbles are forming in global debt china hong kong singapore emerging markets canada australia new zealand european real estate the art market u s stocks u s household wealth corporate debt leveraged loans u s student loans u s auto loans tech startups shale energy global skyscraper construction u s commercial real estate the u s restaurant industry u s healthcare and u s housing once again i believe that these bubbles are going to burst violently in the coming recession which will make the recession much stronger than usual possibly even worse than 08 one of the bubbles that i am warning about is the u s stock market bubble this bubble has caused the s p 500 stock index to soar 300 in the past decade jesse colombo the s p 500 rose at a much faster rate than corporate earnings which means that the u s stock market is quite overvalued now overvalued stock markets eventually fall to more reasonable valuations again which results in bear markets as the cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio chart below shows the u s stock market is almost as overvalued as it was in the roaring twenties right before the 1929 stock market crash and great depression we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us jesse colombo overly inflated stock bond and housing prices have resulted in a massive bubble in u s household wealth which is at extremely high levels relative to the gdp household wealth experienced surges and subsequent crashes during the dot com and housing bubbles so the current bubble is certainly a reason to worry jesse colombo to make matters worse goldman sachs bear market risk indicator has been at its highest level since the early 1970s goldman sachs to summarize u s recession risk is rising at an alarming rate and there are an incredible number of dangerous new bubbles that are poised to burst in the coming downturn this is the time for vigilance not complacency central banks have lulled everyone to sleep in the past decade with easy money but that easy money has created an artificial economy and tremendous distortions that are going to rear their ugly heads very soon
